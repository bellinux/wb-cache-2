2500|$|Subsequent {{plans to}} market a Famicom console in North America {{featuring}} a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless <b>joystick</b> <b>controller</b> {{and a special}} BASIC cartridge under the name [...] "Nintendo Advanced Video System" [...] likewise never materialized. By the beginning of 1985, the Famicom had sold more than 2.5 million units in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System (AVS) that same year. The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region, with the March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stating that [...] "the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared" [...] and that [...] "this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo's part." ...|$|E

5000|$|For five years, 1977 {{until late}} 1982, {{the system was}} officially sold as the Atari VCS, an {{abbreviation}} for Video Computer System. Following {{the release of the}} Atari 5200 in November 1982, the VCS was renamed to the [...] "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers,</b> a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge: initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.|$|R
50|$|Bootleg {{versions}} of Tehkan World Cup appeared in single-player upright cabinets with <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers</b> replacing the trackball {{as the means}} of control. Since the joysticks were digital, player movement and kicking was mapped to 100% trackball speed. This maximized the running performance of the players but eliminated soft and medium strength passing or shooting from the game, essentially depriving it of the subtleties that were its forte. Because joystick play released the true speed potential of the virtual players, scores of 30-0 were possible in a 90-second game.|$|R
50|$|Midnight Magic {{utilized}} the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the <b>joystick</b> <b>controller</b> down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots {{the ball into}} the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the <b>joystick</b> <b>controller</b> left or right. Hitting all five drop targets {{at the top of the}} table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.|$|E

50|$|The CPS Changer {{was sold}} as a package deal of the console itself, one CPS Fighter <b>joystick</b> <b>controller,</b> and the Street Fighter II &prime; (Dash) Turbo game for 39,800 yen. Additional games were sold for about 20,000 yen.|$|E
50|$|The game {{features}} 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, {{the seeds}} that Jose must smear remain in one position wherever {{they had been}} dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing {{to the edge of}} the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the players control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Joses motions directly to the <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers.</b> In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player.|$|R

50|$|Reviews are {{generally}} positive. Christopher Michael Baker of AllGame rates {{the game at}} 4.5 out of 5, finding it virtually flawless, with excellent graphics, sound, and play control. The <b>joystick</b> <b>controller</b> is said to provide a reactive feel which meaningfully mimics a lightsaber, but the game's only flaw is a minor imperfection in play control during the two bonus stages against Boba Fett and Darth Vader.|$|E

5|$|A {{dedicated}} console {{version of}} Tank II was announced by Atari at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, but was cancelled {{by the end}} of the year; the joysticks for the game, designed by Kevin McKinsey, became the standard <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers</b> for the Atari 2600 (1977). The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of the dedicated console version of Tank, a dedicated console game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar Combat! plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and Combat.|$|R
40|$|Teleoperation of high {{degrees of}} freedom (DOF) robots can be non-intuitive and very time {{consuming}} for operators as typical <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers</b> have very small DOF. This often leads to very non-intuitive control scheme that leads to less efficiency during teleoperation (more time needed to achieve a task) and increasing possibilities of costly mistake by the operator. In this project we present an intuitive and higher level teleoperation control scheme for a six-leggeg mining robot which has over 13 {{degrees of freedom}} for locomotion alone. Our control scheme include inverse kinematics control of the position/orientation {{of the body of}} the robot with respect to the wheels, as well as autonomous static balance control. Together, this allows the operator to safely drive the robot around without worrying about balancing the robot, climb over obstacles more efficiently and safely, and prevent falls due to mistakes by the operator...|$|R
50|$|Atari {{released}} a graphical {{version of the}} game for the Atari 2600 console and Atari 8-bit computers in 1978. The program was written by Carol Shaw, {{who went on to}} greater fame as the creator of Activision's River Raid. It uses the standard <b>joystick</b> <b>controller.</b> It can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against the program on one of eight different difficulty settings. The product code for the Atari game was CX-2618.|$|E

50|$|The vehicle {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover lifeboats of up to 15 tonnes in weight. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2.44 m of calm water. The 3208 V8 Caterpillar diesel engine will generate power simultaneously for drive and for winching during its launch and recovery procedure. Control of the vehicle is achieved using a single <b>joystick</b> <b>controller</b> which controls the hydraulic transmission functions and has the added safety feature of a dead man pedal.|$|E
500|$|Tank was {{designed}} by Steve Bristow, who had previously worked with the founders of Atari on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, and was developed by Lyle Rains. It was created as part of Bristow's vision to move the company away from only producing copies of Atari's games into also developing original titles. The game's cabinet {{was designed}} by Peter Takaichi. In September 1974, Atari announced a merger with Kee, which went into effect {{a month after the}} release of the game. The game was commercially successful, selling over 10,000 units and buoying Atari's then-troubled finances. It led to a cocktail cabinet release of the game and to four sequels: Tank II (1974), Tank III (1975), Tank 8 (1976), and Ultra Tank (1978). [...] A dedicated console version of Tank II was announced in 1977 but cancelled later that year; the joysticks for the game, however, became the standard <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers</b> for the Atari 2600 (1977). Variations on the game were included in the Atari 2600 game Combat, {{as well as in the}} Coleco Telstar game Telstar Combat!, both in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|XInput {{supports}} only [...] "next generation" [...] controllers. This limits {{it basically}} to controllers for the Xbox 360 that also have Windows drivers. Legacy Windows <b>controllers,</b> <b>joysticks</b> and generalized haptic feedback devices are not supported.|$|R
40|$|Remotely {{controlled}} devices will be {{used extensively}} to support Space Station Freedom on-orbit assembly, maintenance, and payloads. These include crane-type or remote manipulator systems (RMS), dexterous robots, and remotely-piloted free flyers. A hand controller evaluation process has been established at NASA’s Johnson Space Center to determine the appropriate hand controller configurations required to support these devices. Three test facilities include dynamic computer simulations, kinematic computer simulations, and physical simulations. The dynamic simulator supported a rate-controlled RMS and a free flyer. The kinematic simulator supported a rate-controlled RMS and a rate or position-controlled dexterous manipulator. The physical simulator supported a rate, position, or force-reflecting dexterous manipulator. Standard interfaces were developed to evaluate six different hand controllers in all three facilities. The hand controllers included six degree-of-freedom (DOF) position and rate mini-master and <b>joystick</b> <b>controllers,</b> and three-DOF rate controllers. There were six tasks and four non-astronaut subjects per task. All six controllers were tested for each task. Six astronauts then completed all tasks using all controllers for each task. Data collected included task performance data, subjective comments, and anthropometric data. The results of these evaluations were then used to make hand controller configuration recommendations to the Space Station Freedom Program...|$|R
