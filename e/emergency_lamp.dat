50|$|Only {{eight out}} of the twelve lamps on each face are used in normal operation. They are rated at 30 volts 200 watts, but run at 25 volts 150 watts to provide {{increased}} service life. The other four lamps are 6 volts 28.5 watts and are used only as <b>emergency</b> <b>lamps.</b> Such <b>emergencies</b> may be loss of mains electric power or, far less likely, the complete failure of the main lamp banks. The four lamps {{in each of the}} two main banks are connected in series, which gives each unit the same intensity; however, if one lamp fails, all four in that bank go out. The four <b>emergency</b> <b>lamps</b> on each face are also connected in series in sets of two. Power is provided by emergency batteries. The emergency light is a 200 mm lantern mounted on the balcony rail.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} jointly by ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Environment), Bologna and Florence Universities {{and the firm}} BEGHELLI 1. The system function to be studied is the lighting of a room where a blackout has occurred. The functional unit is an <b>emergency</b> <b>lamp</b> manufactured by BEGHELLI, provided by a fluorescent tube and an accumulator battery with lead elements. The lamp life lasts 10 years. LCA is obtained by using the SimaPro 3. 1 code and two methods: Eco indicator 95 with the normalisation weight ascribed to 10 years and a new method obtained by enclosing into the Eco [...] indicator 95 method some new damage categories such as some raw material depletion, solid and energy. The {{results show that the}} accumulator battery, the structure of the lamp and the electronic board are the components with greater environmental damage and the electrical energy for use produces 31 % of total damage calculated by the Eco - indicator method. The most important categories of damage produced by accumulator battery are acidification due to material production and heavy metals due to disposal treatment of lead, and the ones produced by electronic card are acidification and winter smog due to copper production. To reduce the damage of <b>emergency</b> <b>lamp</b> some new solutions have been proposed. Finally the characteristics to obtain <b>emergency</b> <b>lamp</b> Ecolabel have been proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{emergency}} lighting is quite complicated and meeting all standard requirements are often very complex. Rapid {{development in the}} field of LED light sources has brought new possibilities in the design of emergency lighting. In particular, LED has a higher power output in comparison to conventional light sources used in emergency lighting and also the size of LED is smaller. Another advantage is the possibility of optimal routing of LED diodes by means of suitable optics depending on the areas and the type of emergency lighting. Measurements were performed on a prototype of autonomous <b>emergency</b> <b>lamp,</b> which does not use a conventional battery as a source of energy, but super-capacitor. Especially {{from the perspective of a}} long lifespan, its fast charging and reducing of dependence on temperature, the super-capacitor seems like very reliable replacement of batteries previously used...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Visibility {{of escape}} routes is most {{important}} to guarantee the safety of people indoors during fires. In {{the case of a}} fire, visibility is strongly in-fluenced by the smoke present in the room. In the present work, the extinction co-efficient of the visible light has been experimentally measured {{in the presence of the}} smoke produced by four different test fires, named TF 2, TF 3, TF 4, and TF 5. Tests have been carried out in a specially suited test room in the Italian Fire De-partment Research Center, provided with instruments to measure the optical density of smoke and the spectral extinction coefficient. The results show that, between the smokes produced in the test fires, TF 3 be-haves as the most absorbent one, for the so-called white smokes (with a predomi-nance of particles of condensed liquid), and TF 4 for the black smokes (with predominantly soot particles). Results can also be used to quantitatively calculate the light intensity reduc-tion due to the possible fire that could be produced in a room, in order to properly design the emergency lighting system of the escape ways. Verification tests with a normal <b>emergency</b> <b>lamp</b> have been performed to check this statement. A differ-ence between the computed and measured reduction of illuminance has been dis-covered, and can be ascribed to a large amount of scattered light in the white smokes. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|E

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScConventional power electronics and electronic control circuits have been replacing by {{the intervention of the}} microprocessors/microcontrollers in modern industrial applications. This is mainly because with their applications the whole systems becomes more and more compact while enhancing the durability. On the other even with the more robust applications hand more accurate & fine operation could achieve by using such modern programming devices. This project was origin from based on an actual requirement of designing (10 v battery charging panel (to energize the batteries in spring charge type breakers) for electrical engineering division of Jaya Container Terminal(J. C. T) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority. But this technique would use to not only to charge batteries of spring charge breakers. but also batteries widely use in YHF communication hand held sets, explosive detectors, <b>emergency</b> <b>lamps,</b> etc [...] Rechargeable batteries are vital to portable electronic equipment such as laptop computers and cell phones. Fast charging circuits must be carefully designed and are highly dependent on the particular battery's chemistry. The most popular types of rechargeable batteries in use today are the Sealed-Lead-Acid (SLA), Nickel-Cadmium(NiCd), Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion). Li-Ion is fast becoming the chemistry of choice for many portable applications because it offers a high capacity-tosize (weight) ratio and a low self-discharge characteristic. Depending on the battery chemistry the charging characteristics of a battery differs to each other. In this project simply what I have done is allows the particular battery to follow its charging characteristic curve when they where you could not find in conventional charging techniques. The charging process is controlled by the software program microcontroller (PIC 16 F 876). Since the battery chemistries are different for different types of batteries, several sets of programs would have to written to the controller for each battery given by the manufacturer. There are some theoretical design calculations included for designing of power electronics modules. DCDC converter, square pulse generator, single rail power & dual rail power supplies,(etc [...] ) Calculations have been done based on highly theoretical facts. Therefore some practical observations are tends to differ from the theoretical approach. Most of the theories studied in the power electronic lessons of my M. S post graduate were widely used in doing above mentioned designs. At the beginning the actual target was to built a battery charging panel of 110 V,tut due to some limitations of purchasing of high capacity transformer which suit to this application,the project was limited to 40 V panel only. But the concept, approach & the guide line would be more or less same for the more advanced systems also...|$|R
