Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

It, like many songs on The Rhythm of the Saints, was recorded {{live in the}} streets of Pelourinho Square of Salvador, Brazil in February 1988.

500|$|Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online {{reviewed}} the album as [...] "a sophisticated piano collection" [...] that was enjoyable to listen to, though {{he noted that}} the arrangements were [...] "straightforward" [...] rather than ambitious. Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version gave a similar review for the album; he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> album that, while not as technically difficult or different enough from the source material for some listeners, was still very beautiful and well-arranged. Gann of RPGFan, however, felt disappointed by the album, calling the arrangements [...] "soul-less" [...] and full of [...] "needless grandiosity". He concluded that the original pieces were too rich and complex to translate well to solo piano arrangements, which left the works without substance as they did not deviate enough from the source material.|$|E
500|$|The game's storyline {{was written}} by Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton, who are all regular writers on The Simpsons. They wanted to create {{something}} that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, [...] "a great new game". Matt Groening and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its [...] "look and feel" [...] to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it The Simpsons Game and not add a subtitle was because they {{felt it was a}} restart of [...] "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

2500|$|Private {{initiatives}} {{such as the}} Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) {{attempted to}} fill the gap caused by the end of government relief, and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies. Thousands of dollars were raised in the United States, including $170 collected from a group of Native American Choctaws in 1847. Judy Allen, editor of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma's newspaper Biskinik, wrote that [...] "It had been just 16 years since the Choctaw people had experienced the Trail of Tears, and they had faced starvation... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> gesture".

[...] Both Hooper and the actors believe that this choice of production method will make the film feel much more emotional, raw, and real.

And I think it was a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was always working in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life." ...|$|E

I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk.
