5000|$|After the Church Committee {{had begun}} its investigation, the Nedzi Committee was created, headed by Democratic Congressman Lucien N. Nedzi which {{dissolved}} {{only after a}} few months. Its successor was the Pike Committee, officially called the Select Committee on Intelligence which revealed more secret dealings of the US government. This was {{around the same time}} as the United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States, commonly called the Rockefeller Commission. The American Prospect gives some background, noting that prior to these investigations, [...] "the U.S. intelligence community had never undergone significant congressional scrutiny" [...] because of a [...] "laissez-faire attitude...but after a 1974 New York Times series by Seymour Hersh revealed that the CIA had conducted [...] "massive" [...] illegal spying activities against American antiwar protesters and dissidents, Congress and the executive branch convulsed into action." [...] Three separate bodies just described were created to further this investigation. The report was suppressed from the start but <b>was</b> leaked by <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> to the Village Voice who asked the publication to give to his legal defense fund, which was refused. Schorr showed the [...] "committee report...on television and discussed its contents," [...] resulting in his resignation from CBS and to his death, refusing [...] "to identify his source for the Pike committee report." ...|$|R

5000|$|I like {{to think}} of it as the only show on public radio other than [...] "Car Talk" [...] that both <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> news analyst and Kurt Cobain singer/guitarist of Nirvana could listen to. I think it's {{appropriate}} that the show aired on Friday evenings is on a station that most people don't listen to at a time when most people won't hear it. And the fact that public radio never puts a new show on the air or takes any off is definitely to our advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programs}} feature longer stories {{than most}} NPR news magazines and more {{arts and culture}} stories.

In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> <b>was</b> on that list.

The first minute is a music bed solely for use of the member stations. The second minute, from nineteen to twenty past, is a [...] "headlines" [...] segment in which the NPR newscaster on staff that morning recaps the major stories of the hour.
