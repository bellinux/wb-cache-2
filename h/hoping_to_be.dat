5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and {{decided it would be}} difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States, but the position went to Rex E. Lee, to Scalia's great disappointment. Scalia was offered {{a seat on the}} Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward {{and did not want to}} see him gain high office.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{continued}} to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> absolved from the oath {{he had made}} at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup {{with the support of}} Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent to help make peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E

5|$|The Deimon Devil Bats {{enter the}} spring tournament; they lose to the Ojo White Knights, but Sena decides {{to stay on}} the team because he finds it fun. They train for the autumn tournament, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the best team in Tokyo and advance to the Kanto tournament and the Christmas Bowl (between the best high-school American {{football}} teams in Japan). Despite Hiruma's desire to keep the identity of Eyeshield 21 a secret, Sena reveals his identity to his teammates when they are training in the United States. He later reveals his identity to Mamori and everyone against Bando Spiders, when Hayato Akaba claims to be Eyeshield 21. Sena eventually beats Akaba, claiming the title of Eyeshield 21. At the Kanto tournament, after defeating Shinryuji Naga, his rival Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin, and the Hakushu Dinosaurs, Sena is the tournament's MVP and the Devil Bats win the chance to play in the Christmas Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} few {{noteworthy}} performances in later-season single-day races. Sánchez held the Clásica de San Sebastián {{as a target}} for his season, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first Euskaltel-Euskadi rider to win the race. Sánchez rode {{at the front of}} the race most of the day, until the winner Philippe Gilbert made his signature solo attack to earn victory. Sánchez finished near the back of the chase pack 14 seconds down the road, for eighth place on the day. Izagirre just missed the podium at the Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia, finishing fourth in a five-man escape that decided the race. Near the end of the season, the team did obtain a podium finish. Trainee rider Peio Bilbao finished second in October's Tour de Vendée. He was just edged out by 's Marco Marcato in a five-man sprint finish. Only 14 riders officially completed this race due to race organizers strictly enforcing the time cut.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Texas Tech {{football}} coach DeWitt Weaver approached a student named Joe Kirk Fulton about becoming the Masked Rider.

At the time, Texas Tech was <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{invited to join the}} Southwest Conference. All the other teams had a mascot, and it is thought that DeWitt believed creating a mascot for Texas Tech might aid the school's chances for admission into the conference. Fulton agreed to ride a horse named Blackie in the bowl game.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August 1811, Godinot's {{division}} encountered O'Donnell at Zújar. The French general's division included four battalions of the 8th Line, {{and three}} battalions {{each of the}} 16th Light and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. This force may have numbered as many as 8,000 men. <b>Hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reinforced by La Cuadra, O'Donnell placed his troops behind the Guardal River {{on the outskirts of}} town. In the afternoon, Godinot fell on the Spanish troops and routed them. O'Donnell's division lost 423 killed and wounded, and 1,000 captured or missing.|$|E
