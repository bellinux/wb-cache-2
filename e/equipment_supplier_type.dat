40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the underlying design information and success factors for production equipment acquisition, in order to support the design of high-performance production systems. Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy employed was an in-depth case study of an industrialization project, together with a questionnaire of 25 <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Findings - The study provides the reader with an insight into the role of design information when acquiring production equipment by addressing questions such as: What type of information is used? How do <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> obtain information? What factors facilitate a smooth production system acquisition? Research limitations/implications - Limitations are primarily associated with the chosen research methodology, which requires further empirical studies to establish a generic value. Practical implications - The implications are that manufacturing companies have to transfer various types of design information with respect to the content and kind of information. More attention has to be placed on what information is transferred to ensure that <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> receive all the information needed to design and subsequently build the production equipment. To facilitate integration of <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers,</b> manufacturing companies should appoint a contact person who can gather, understand and transform relevant design information. Originality/value - External integration of <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> in production system design by means of design information is an area that has been rarely addressed in academia and industr...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the {{problems}} and opportunities faced by <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> during collaboration with firms in the process industries, throughout the different stages of operational projects. Empirically, results are obtained from 22 interviews in a multiple case study of eight <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The results show that strong collaboration is often required in operational projects to facilitate technology transfer and better operational performance. In particular, collaboration is essential to transfer knowledge about the equipment from the <b>equipment</b> <b>supplier</b> to the process firm in the start-up stage where intimate educational activities are typically required. However, these projects are often very complex to manage, as interdependences among a number of actors and activities create problems for both buyer and supplier. By focusing on the collaborations between process firms and <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> in the operational stages, this study shows how open innovation can facilitate not only product innovation but also process innovation, by means of collaborative selection and installation of new process equipment – i. e. “open operation”.

40|$|Collaborative {{development}} {{between the}} user and the <b>equipment</b> <b>supplier</b> of production technology has {{an increasingly important}} effect in terms of generating innovative, sustainable, and unique production process ideas {{that can be easily}} ramped-up to high volume production. However, joint development of production technology is challenging and has received surprisingly limited attention. Against this background the objective of the paper is to explore collaborative challenges from the <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers</b> and customers’ perspectives in production technology development projects, and to suggest strategies for how these challenges can be addressed. Empirically the results are based on multiple case studies from two manufacturing companies in Sweden (i. e. users) and two <b>equipment</b> <b>suppliers,</b> ensuring that the perspectives of both the user and supplier sides in production technology development projects are considered. Our findings show that the identified collaboration challenges do not only relate to inter-organizational development activities but also to the companies’ internal characteristics, i. e. the prerequisites for company collaboration. Internal characteristics have a clear impact on the ability to bridge the interface with the <b>equipment</b> <b>supplier</b> and thus to advance the collaboration in production technology development projects. Our findings underscore the importance of having intra and inter-organizational strategies to enhance the success related to collaboration in production technology development projects...|$|R
