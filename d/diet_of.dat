5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> other hosts.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E

They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> five forest-dwelling species of dasyurid marsupials endemic to New Guinea by using faecal and gut content analysis and compared the contents {{with the results}} of pitfall trapping for terrestrial invertebrates carried out coincidently. In one study area, in montane forest 2060 – 2340 m above sea level, three dasyurid species were trapped. In another area, in forest 1000 – 1470 mabove sea level, two other species were captured. All five species ate a diverse range of invertebrates but beetles (Coleoptera) and spiders (Araneae) formed the bulk <b>of</b> their <b>diet,</b> followed by grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera). Earthworms (Annelida) were eaten by all species and some vertebrate remains were found in samples from four species. We found some significant differences between <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> the sympatric species. Some of the invertebrates commonly collected in pitfall traps, such as isopods (Isopoda) and amphipods (Amphipoda), were rarely detected in the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> any of the species and millipedes (Diplopoda) and centipedes (Chilopoda) were never detected. Our results are broadly in agreement with what is known about the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> the small Australian species of dasyurid marsupials. G. L. Grossek, P. A. Woolley and J. I. Menzie...|$|R
40|$|A key {{challenge}} in ecology {{is to find}} ways to obtain complete and accurate information about the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> animals. Traditional methods of collecting such information from seabirds (usually stomach content analysis or observations of prey at nests) are hampered by biases and only give information from the immediate time of sampling. Furthermore, the period of investigation using traditional methods is often restricted to the few short months of breeding. Here, we use an analysis of fatty acids and fatty alcohols from blood, adipose tissue and stomach oil to investigate how the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> male and female common guillemots (Uria aalge), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) differed through the sampling period (prelaying and breeding season) and by sex. <b>Diets</b> <b>of</b> both sexes of all three species generally varied across the season, but sex differences were apparent only in fulmars during prelaying. Our study shows that FA analysis can provide significant insights into <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> seabirds, in particular periods of the annual cycle which are not readily studied using traditional methods. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{livestock}} {{sector has}} {{a major impact on}} the environment. This environmental impact may be reduced by feeding agricultural co-products (e. g. beet tails) to livestock, as this transforms inedible products for humans into edible products, e. g. pork or beef. Nevertheless, co-products have different applications such as bioenergy production. Based on a framework we developed, we assessed environmental consequences of using co-products in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> livestock, including the alternative application of that co-product. We performed a consequential life cycle assessment, regarding greenhouse gas emissions (including emissions related to land use change) and land use, for two case studies. Case 1 includes increasing the use of wheat middlings in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> dairy cattle at the expense of using it in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> pigs. The decreased use of wheat middlings in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> pigs was substituted with barley, the marginal product. Case 2 includes increasing the use of beet tails in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> dairy cattle at the expense of using it to produce bioenergy. During the production of biogas, electricity, heat and digestate (that is used as organic fertilizer) were produced. The decrease of electricity and heat was substituted with fossil fuel, and digestate was substituted with artificial fertilizer. Using wheat middlings in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> dairy cattle instead of using it in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> pigs resulted in a reduction of 329 kg CO 2 eq per ton wheat middlings and a decrease of 169 m(2) land. Using beet tails in <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> dairy cattle instead of using it as a substrate for anaerobic digestion resulted in a decrease of 239 kg CO 2 eq per ton beet tails and a decrease of 154 m(2) land. Emissions regarding land use change contributed significantly in both cases but had a high uncertainty factor, +/- 170 ton CO 2 ha(- 1). Excluding emissions from land use change resulted in a decrease of 9 kg CO 2 eq for case 1 'wheat middlings' and an increase of 50 kg CO 2 eq for case 2 'beet tails'. Assessing the use of co-products in the livestock sector is of importance because shifting its application can reduce the environmental impact of the livestock sector. A correct assessment of the environmental consequences of using co-products in animal feed should also include potential changes in impacts outside the livestock sector, such as the impact in the bioenergy sector...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{clinical}} aspects of fructose supplementa-tion in the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> individuals with diabetes {{should focus on}} the balance between beneficial effects and possible side effects. Fruc-tose supplementation in diabetes mellitus was advocated before insulin was discovered. Fructose elicits a lower glucose and in-sulin response in healthy individuals and in individuals with di-abetes. The use of fructose as a sweetener in the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> diabetics has been debated repeatedly. Short-term studies have now shown that substitution of fructose for sucrose in the <b>diets</b> <b>of</b> individuals with diabetes improves glycemic control and {{does not appear to have}} substantial side effects. In balanced <b>diets,</b> reasonable amounts <b>of</b> fructose supplementation do not affect lipoprotein metabolism or result in gastrointestinal symptoms. Long-term studies are still needed to ascertain that long-term fructose supplementation has a sustained beneficial effect in diabetes and is devoid of deleterious side effects. Am J Clin Nut...|$|R
