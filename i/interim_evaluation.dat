The model used by Lizzeri, Meyers and Persico (2002) under the assumption of a risk neutral agent restricted by limited liability is analyzed when the agent is risk averse to show that <b>interim</b> performance <b>evaluations</b> do matter in reducing contract costs. In particular, they enable the principal to transfer the burden of insuring the agent against risk to the agent herself. Hence, the same incentives can be provided without as much consumption smoothing once performance information is revealed. On the other hand, when the incentive scheme is fixed, the risk averse agent may find it optimal to exert a greater amount of effort when performance evaluations are not revealed so as to insure herself against the possible losses that come with unexpected bad outcomes. ...|$|R

40|$|For many organisations Information Technology (IT) enabled {{business}} {{initiatives and}} IT infrastructure constitute major investments. If these investments are not managed properly or the technological initiatives are not integrated correctly within the business, the organisations competitive position is impaired. Currently, both management and IT professionals {{are concerned with}} design, implementation, and assessment of IT governance strategies to ensure that technology truly serves {{the needs of the}} business. These strategies aim to align IT applications with the objectives of the business. The question addressed by this research is: How does a complex organisation devise, implement, and assess its IT governance arrangements? Devising IT governance arrangements is challenging because the success of IT strategies and procedures is contingent upon a variety of internal and external factors, such as workgroup interdependency and competitive strategy. Implementing an IT governance framework can be a complex endeavour because organisations must integrate the unique expertise of diverse stakeholders and service providers. This research explores the factors influencing the IT governance structures, processes, and outcome metrics. Using data from an in-depth case study conducted in a complex energy organisation, this research provides empirical evidence that increases our understanding of IT governance arrangements. Interview responses indicated that effective IT governance performance outcomes are characterised by a shared understanding of business and IT objectives; active involvement of IT steering committees; a balance of business and IT representatives in IT decision making; and comprehensive and wellcommunicated IT strategies and policies. IT governance {{plays a key role in}} fostering project success and delivering value.

40|$|In {{the conduct}} of {{sequential}} clinical trials, primary statistical issues include design, monitoring and reporting. Currently, approaches built upon frequentist inference methodology predominate. Focusing on the design aspect, our objective {{is the development of}} a very general Bayesian framework permitting multiple arms with multiple patient endpoints and multiple stopping criteria. Specification of a sequential Bayesian design requires a likelihood, a prior and a stopping rule. We take a nonparametric perspective for the likelihood specification. We do so by representing discrete patient response as a categorical outcome described through cells in a multiway contingency table, while we assume that continuous data is drawn from a distribution which arises through Dirichlet process mixing. To address the subjectivity in the prior specification we can consider a range of priors from skeptical to enthusiastic to capture our views. Historical data available on the standard or placebo arm are used to form the prior for that arm the multiple stopping criteria are employed to define the stopping rule. We propose two different approaches: The first one is descriptive. Given a model specification a design is characterized by a number of <b>interim</b> <b>evaluations,</b> the group size for each interim look, and a set of stopping criteria which determine our decision at a given look. We then simulate replications of the design and use these replicates to summarize design performance in terms of when the trial was stopped and reason for stopping. The second approach is decision-theoretic. We obtain optimal bounded designs using backward induction, implemented via Monte Carlo integration. While required random generation grows geometrically in the number of interim looks we provide computationally feasible bounds for the needed continuation risks as well as the expected sample sizes. We offer some qualitative results on the behavior of such designs and then present examples to illustrate the entire development. ...|$|R
