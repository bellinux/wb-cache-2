25|$|Deutsche Reichsbahn {{initiated}} the pre-planning {{in the summer}} of 1991. A preparatory study had been submitted to the central administration of the Reichsbahn (Zentralen Hauptverwaltung der Reichsbahn, ZHvDR) in November 1991. It served {{as the basis for the}} preliminary <b>drafting</b> <b>plan,</b> which was prepared by the Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit ("Planning Corporation for German Unity Railway Construction") from early 1992 and confirmed by the ZHvDR at the end of 1992. At the same time, a national and environmental protection planning study was carried out with the participating federal states and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. Within the scope of a space sensitivity test, a large-scale corridor investigation was carried out on the scale of 1:100,000 to determine route options. Among other things, conflicts and risks in relation to spatial and environmental factors along with railway operations and economic aspects were taken into account. According to the planning as of mid-1991, commissioning would be carried out by 2000 if possible.|$|E
40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the Heald frames. The heald frames on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of heald frame causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing <b>drafting</b> <b>plan.</b> In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to heald frames nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The <b>drafting</b> <b>plan</b> of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital Crimp Tester and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting heald frame position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing fancy weave...|$|E

The proposed mixed uses and abandonment of the wilderness zoning in the <b>Draft</b> <b>Plan</b> detract from effective wilderness preservation and reflect both anthropocentric and eco-pragmatic considerations.
