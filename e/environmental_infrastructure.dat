2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, {{significant}} development {{has occurred in}} the Bronx, first stimulated by the city's [...] "Ten-Year Housing Plan" [...] and community members working to rebuild the social, economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>infrastructure</b> by creating affordable housing. Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units. The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx. The IRT White Plains Road Line (...) began to show an increase in riders. Chains such as Marshalls, Staples, and Target opened stores in the Bronx. More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole (rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007), although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods, while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs.|$|E
2500|$|The Gelhaus family re-acquired the Keansburg Amusement Park in 1995, {{following}} a 20-year absence after Henry Gelhaus had sold {{the property in}} 1972. [...] The return of the Gelhaus family as proprietors of the amusement park sparked a resurgence {{of interest in the}} town. [...] Upgrades were made to the amusement park grounds and a water park was constructed. [...] Runaway rapids was opened in 1996 {{on the site of the}} former Crystal Pool. The Keansburg Waterfront Public Library, founded in 2004, was the result of a concerted effort on the part of townspeople and the borough government to provide a high quality library with resources that address the needs and interests of the community. In 2012, the town added a $3 million desalination plant with Federal Stimulus Funds and a low interest loan from the N.J. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Trust, which greatly improved the quality of the water supply. [...] The town had previously stopped providing well water, as saltwater intrusion into the aquifer had exceeded environmental protection standards. [...] The new facility removes contaminants from the water supply through reverse osmosis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing a {{panel of}} 44 {{developed}} and developing countries, this paper analyzes the macro-environmental determinants of Internet financial reporting (IFR) {{within the context of}} corporate governance models, and thus, addresses the question of which governance model's disclosure demands are more associated with IFR. Both physical and institutional infrastructures are shown to be important determinants of a country's adoption of IFR. Along with the corporate governance structure, these infrastructures combine with IFR to enhance transparency and market efficiency, both major goals of financial reporting and disclosure. These findings point to requisite <b>environmental</b> <b>infrastructures</b> governments must provide or foster for firms within their confines to effectively adopt IFR and thus, reap the attendant benefits of disclosure. They also contribute to the debate on harmonization of international financial reporting by showing that requisite <b>environmental</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are a precondition for the success of any reporting system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The slum {{population}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{is expected to}} grow from 101 million in 1990 to 313 million in 2015. Modernizing sanitation therefore has to adapt to the context of cities with high densities of poor people under the conditions of absent or fragmented <b>environmental</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and services. Addressing this problem requires an integrated approach that deviates both from the Western large-scale, high-technological, and grid-based systems, {{as well as from the}} small-scale, low-tech, decentralized alternative options. A Modernized Mixtures approach should be developed that combines the strong elements from these opposing alternatives. This chapter presents the Modernized Mixtures approach and its contribution to sustain-ability. It discusses the contribution this approach can make to improving accessibility of urban infrastructures for the poor, while strengthening flexibility and resilience. It is argued that the successful introduction of a Modernized Mixtures approach to urban <b>environmental</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in East African cities requires the careful consideration of social and political factors next to technological innovation...|$|R

In 2010, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> and Platforms (ENVIP) {{initiative}} was introduced {{as a means}} to identify the European potentials and specify common building blocks (‘services and enablers’) related to environmental information sharing and re-use. In the first years, the work of ENVIP focused on a set of EU funded research and development projects supporting the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS). This paper briefly presents the intermediate results and introduces the next wave of expansion activities, which follow two newly emerging trends: Citizens Observatories and Linked Open Data. It thereby summarises the scope, structure, contents, and outcomes of the Environmental Information System...|$|R
