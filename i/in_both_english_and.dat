5|$|In {{response}} the Liberal Party launched Women's Liberal Associations {{which allowed}} women {{more freedom to}} allocate a role and voice for themselves and were not a mere subsidiary of the national party. The organisation {{of women in the}} Liberal Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan, Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas. In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women's Liberal Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>English</b> <b>and</b> Welsh. By 1893 there were said to be 7,000 members of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations which had raised to 9,000 by 1895. At a meeting of the North Wales Liberal Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women's Liberal Federation would merge with Cymru Fydd, a political pressure group for home rule, to form a new Welsh Liberal Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation. Despite some early successes Liberal organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes, many of the branches had closed by 1907.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1824 Heber {{set out on}} a tour of {{northern}} India, accompanied by his personal chaplain, Martin Stowe, and Daniel Corrie, the Archdeacon of Calcutta. Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet. The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges, then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west, crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay. The journey was almost aborted near to its beginning when Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue. Early in August the party reached Benares (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well-established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a Holy Communion service <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>English</b> <b>and</b> Hindustani, a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.|$|E
5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became {{the highest court}} of appeal <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>English</b> <b>and</b> Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. To deal with these cases, a barrister had {{to be familiar with}} both Scottish and English law, and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.|$|E
