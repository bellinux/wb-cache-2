500|$|In the 2006–07 season, Howard {{achieved}} nine double-doubles in 80games played (37starts), while averaging 9.7points and 5.9rebounds. During the season, he {{lost the}} starting power forward position to Chuck Hayes, but <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting lineup when Yao got injured. [...] His 26.5minutes per game marked a new career low. Howard only started 38 games, including 32 consecutive starts between December 26, 2006, and March 3, 2007, while center Yao was recovering from his fractured right leg. The 2006–07 Rockets were 52–30 under Van Gundy for the regular season. The Rockets entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs with little experience; Howard {{was one of only}} three players on the team (along with Rafer Alston and Dikembe Mutombo) to have previously won any NBA playoff series. Once the playoffs began, Howard served as a key reserve on the Rockets' short bench rotation that also included Luther Head and Mutombo. The Rockets managed to split the first 4 games even though Head and Howard only combined to average 7.6 points, including a combined pointless 0-for-10 game three. Although Howard had a productive game five with 12 points and 6 rebounds which contributed to a Rockets victory, the team lost {{in the first round of}} the 2007 playoffs to the , four games to three. [...] In the playoffs, reserve Howard averaged 5.0points and 4.4rebounds in 22.4minutes. Although Howard was described as a consistent role player and locker-room leader, his salary continued to be perceived as outrageous by sportswriters such as the Houston Chronicle Jerome Solomon.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2006, Norwood was {{involved}} in a fatal automobile accident on Los Angeles' San Diego (405) Freeway. The accident claimed the life of the 38-year-old driver of a Toyota that was struck by Norwood's Range Rover. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with vehicular manslaughter due to insufficient evidence. Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney. Posing an extraordinary hardship for Brandy and her family, Norwood stepped down from her role as a judge on the second season of the amateur talent contest America's Got Talent and went into hiatus. Expanding on dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, Norwood explained, [...] "I just wanted people to know that this wasn't news. It's not something that should be talked about like it's gossip. You don't like me? Fine. But don't use this situation to try to hurt me, because the guilt of being involved is enough. It's something that I'll never truly, truly get over." [...] While the accident put a halt on the album's production, Norwood soon resumed recording which she found to be therapeutic: [...] "I had to face it and find the strength to move forward. Connecting back with music has definitely helped me through everything. Once I <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio, the butterflies went away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E
2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for Day for Night. The critic's reviews of Monuments to an Elegy, which holds a rating of 70/100 at Metacritic based on 31 reviews, were criticized by Corgan for being [...] "middling, muddling" [...] reviews and not offering a [...] "fair" [...] evaluation of the album, while also admitting he didn't even read any of the reviews. Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a {{problem of how to}} get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem before I can solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the thing I want to do.' But now what I want to do is kick people out of the way." [...] Corgan later revealed that the follow up to Monuments to an Elegy would no longer to be titled Day for Night.|$|E
