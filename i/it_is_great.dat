[...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> to get an early one over them.

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show [...] "at a lightning quick pace". Krause deemed the episode [...] "stellar", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. [...] "This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how [...] "this case brought out the hore in just about everyone, pushing their limits for a patient". Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that [...] "pulling {{all the people in}} the operating room out, even though he was already sick and could have easily died from the effort" [...] in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and [...] "unlikable ways", which attracted criticism from Krause.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 56 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most {{of the time we}} know what's going on. All of the time, we know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery".|$|E

Moores' faith in Smith's batting was further repaid in a match against Hampshire, when Smith scored 95; however, in the match Smith suffered a stomach strain. This coincided with injuries to Glen Chapple, Steven Cheetham, and Sajid Mahmood and with Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson on England duty, Lancashire's bowling attack was severely depleted.

She {{played the role of}} a traffic accident victim in the film, which entered into the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Her performance in the film won her favourable reviews. Film critic M. Ali Ikram wrote about her performance: [...] "If there is a respite for Manisha's innumerable fans of late, this flick is it. We may not care about hits and flops, but it is painful to watch this acting virtuoso in the innumerable side roles she has been seen in of late. Indra Kumar's decision to cast Manisha here is a case of perfect casting, and she never lets him or the audience down. This lady is truly the Meena Kumari of her generation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> fun watching Manisha and Aamir Khan's perfect chemistry opposite one another.

Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Frieda {{obtained}} her divorce. The couple {{returned to}} Britain {{shortly before the}} outbreak of World War I and were married on 13 July 1914. At this time, Lawrence worked with London intellectuals and writers such as Dora Marsden and the people involved with The Egoist (T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and others). The Egoist, an important Modernist literary magazine, published some of his work. He was also reading and adapting Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism. He also met at this time the young Jewish artist Mark Gertler, and they became (for a time) good friends; Lawrence would describe Gertler's 1916 anti-war painting, Merry-Go-Round as [...] "the best modern picture I have seen: I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> and true." [...] Gertler would inspire the character Loerke (a sculptor) in Women in Love. Frieda's German parentage and Lawrence's open contempt for militarism caused them to be viewed with suspicion in wartime Britain and to live in near destitution. The Rainbow (1915) was suppressed after an investigation into its alleged obscenity in 1915. Later, they were accused of spying and signaling to German submarines {{off the coast of}} Cornwall where they lived at Zennor. During this period he finished writing Women in Love. Not published until 1920, it is now widely recognised as an English novel of great dramatic force and intellectual subtlety.|$|E
