In order to accommodate for the intended European uses on quinces, several root crops, bulb vegetables, cucurbits (inedible peel), witloof chicory, <b>globe</b> <b>artichokes,</b> rice and chicory roots and to accommodate the authorized use in Brazil on papaya, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for difenoconazole in all these crops. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops considered. The applicant has not submitted data on TDM residues in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of difenoconazole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for difenoconazole and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. The consumer risk assessment regarding the TDMs was not undertaken in the framework of the current application and has to be performed as soon as the confirmatory data for triazole pesticides are available and a suitable risk assessment methodology has been developed, taking into account the contribution of the TDMs present in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and products of animal origin resulting from different triazole pesticides...|$|R

5000|$|Cynara cardunculus is the cardoon, {{artichoke}} thistle, or wild artichoke. The {{stems of}} cultivated varieties {{are used as}} food around the Mediterranean.

50|$|Flor de Guía {{cheese is}} a Spanish cheese (Queso de Flor de guía) {{made on the}} island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It has Denomination of Origin protection.

The milk from the sheep must constitute at least 60% and cows’ milk content must never exceed 40%. Goat milk must never exceed 10% of the mixture. The cheese is presented in flat cylindrical cheeses which normally measure 4-8 cm (1.5-3 inches) high and 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) across and weighing between 2 and 5 kg (4.5-11 pounds). The cheese gets its name from an area in northern Gran Canaria called Santa María de Guia, where the cheese is made, and ‘flor’ from the fact that juice from the flowerheads of a species of cardoon and <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> are used to curdle the milk.|$|E
50|$|Fructans {{are another}} source of {{prebiotic}} soluble dietary fibers.

While many of these foods lack in butyrate production compared to resistant starch, {{they do have a}} number of benefits. They generally possess a low glycemic index which appeals well to diabetics. They also appeal to those on the ketogenic diet who benefit from beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which is a HDAC inhibitor which can cross the blood brain barrier and be used as fuel in the mitochondria of brain cells. Other HDAC inhibitors in these butyrate producing foods are sulforaphane, which has promise in inhibiting human breast cancer cells. Sulforaphane has also been shown to promote hair growth in mice, it contains compounds which prevent ulcers, and helps with cognitive function in rats. It is good to note that sulforaphane in broccoli is destroyed if prepared improperly. Diallyl disulfide found in the fructans containing garlic has been shown to reduce chemical toxicity and carcinogenesis in rodents, and shows synergestic benefits with butyrate when it comes to inhibiting the growth of human cancer tumor cells in the colon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L., Asteraceae) is a {{perennial}} crop traditionally consumed as a vegetable in the Mediterranean countries and rich in nutraceutically and pharmaceutically active compounds, including phenolic and terpenoid compounds.

The biosynthetic pathway responsible for STL biosynthesis in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> is unknown, but likely proceeds through germacrene A, {{as has been shown}} for other Asteraceae species. Here, we investigated the accumulation of cynaropicrin in different tissues of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> and compared it to accumulation of phenolic compounds.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{leaves of}} <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and {{cultivated}} cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) have significant pharmaceutical properties, which mainly result from their high content of polyphenolic compounds such as monocaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCQ), {{and a range}} of flavonoid compounds. Results Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HQT) encoding genes have been isolated from both <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and cultivated cardoon (GenBank accessions DQ 915589 and DQ 915590, respectively) using CODEHOP and PCR-RACE. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that their sequences belong to one of the major acyltransferase groups (anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). The heterologous expression of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> HQT in E. coli showed that this enzyme can catalyze the esterification of quinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA or p -coumaroyl-CoA to generate, respectively, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and p -coumaroyl quinate. Real time PCR experiments demonstrated an increase in the expression level of HQT in UV-C treated leaves, and established a correlation between the synthesis of phenolic acids and protection against damage due to abiotic stress. The HQT gene, together with a gene encoding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) previously isolated from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> have been incorporated within the developing <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> linkage maps.

40|$|Leaf {{extracts}} from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus) {{have been widely}} used in medicine as hepatoprotectant and choleretic agents. <b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> leaves represent a natural source of phenolic acids with dicaffeoylquinic acids, such as cynarin (1, 3 -dicaffeoylquinic acid), along with its biosynthetic precursor chlorogenic acid (5 -caffeoylquinic acid) as the most abundant molecules. This paper reports the development of an experimental system to induce caffeoylquinic acids. This system may serve to study the regulation of the biosynthesis of (poly) phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and the genetic basis of this metabolic regulation. By means of HPLC-PDA and accurate mass LC-QTOF MS and MS/MS analyses, the major phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> leaves were identified: four isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid, three isomers of caffeoylquinic acid, and the flavone luteolin 7 -glucoside. Next, plant material was identified in which the concentration of phenolic compounds was comparable in the absence of particular treatments, with the aim to use this material to test the effect of stress application on the regulation of biosynthesis of caffeoylquinic acids. Using this material, the effect of UV-C, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid treatments on (poly) phenolic compounds was tested in different <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> genotypes. UV-C exposure consistently increased the levels of dicaffeoylquinic acids in all genotypes, whereas the effect on compounds from the same biosynthetic pathway, for example, chlorogenic acid and luteolin- 7 -glucoside, was much less pronounced and was not statistically significant. No effect of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid was found. Time-response experiments indicated that the level of dicaffeoylquinic acids reached a maximum at 24 h after UV radiation.
