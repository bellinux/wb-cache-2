50|$|The {{trend toward}} the {{demotion}} and elimination <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women was first observed by Sarah Blanding in 1946, who noticed <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> women being subordinated to male administrators {{in charge of}} general student affairs.

In the late 1980s, less than 20% <b>of</b> <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> students were female.|$|R
