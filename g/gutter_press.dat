25|$|The {{projection}} of Sanders {{into the national}} public spotlight resulted from a sensational newspaper article in 1969 {{which led to the}} romanticised biography, King of the Witches, by June Johns in 1969, and the film Legend of the Witches (1970). These led to greater publicity, guest appearances on talk-shows, and public speaking engagements. It seemed to other Witches that Sanders was exploiting the Craft and dragging it through the <b>gutter</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
60|$|STRAMMFEST. You are young, {{young and}} heartless. You are {{excited by the}} revolution: you are {{attached}} to abstract things like liberty. But my family has served the Panjandrums of Beotia faithfully for seven centuries. The Panjandrums have kept our place for us at their courts, honored us, promoted us, shed their glory on us, made us what we are. When I hear you young men declaring that you are fighting for civilization, for democracy, for the overthrow of militarism, I ask myself how can a man shed his blood for empty words used by vulgar tradesmen and common laborers: mere wind and stink. [He rises, exalted by his theme.] A king is a splendid reality, a man raised above us like a god. You can see him; you can kiss his hand; you can be cheered by his smile and terrified by his frown. I would have died for my Panjandrum as my father died for his father. Your toiling millions were only too honored to receive the toes of our boots in the proper spot for them when they displeased their betters. And now what is left in life for me? [He relapses into his chair discouraged.] My Panjandrum is deposed and transported to herd with convicts. The army, his pride and glory, is paraded to hear seditious speeches from penniless rebels, with the colonel actually forced to take the chair and introduce the speaker. I myself am made Commander-in-Chief by my own solicitor: a Jew, Schneidekind! a Hebrew Jew! It seems only yesterday that these things {{would have been the}} ravings of a madman: today they are the commonplaces of the <b>gutter</b> <b>press.</b> I live now for three objects only: to defeat the enemy, to restore the Panjandrum, and to hang my solicitor.|$|E

5000|$|By {{implying}} that God might not actively sustain {{the natural and}} social hierarchies, the book threatened the social order and could provide ammunition to Chartists and revolutionaries. Anglican clergymen and naturalists attacked the book, with the geologist Adam Sedgwick predicting [...] "ruin and confusion in such a creed" [...] which, if {{taken up by the}} working classes, [...] "will undermine the whole moral and social fabric" [...] bringing [...] "discord and deadly mischief in its train". The book was liked by many Quakers and Unitarians. The Unitarian physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter called it [...] "a very beautiful and a very interesting book", and helped Chambers with correcting later editions. Critics thanked God that the author began [...] "in ignorance and presumption", for the revised versions [...] "would have been much more dangerous". Nevertheless, the book caused a sensation and quickly went through a number of new editions. Vestiges brought widespread discussion of evolution out of the streets and <b>gutter</b> <b>presses</b> and into the drawing rooms of respectable men and women.|$|R

It works collaboratively with partners such as Mercury Musical Developments to create new writing opportunities.

50|$|The company's logo, a nude silhouette, was {{designed}} by Workman's mother, artist Beverly Hawksley. The name Isadora originated with a publicity campaign in which Workman published love letters, and classified ads in Now magazine, to the fictitious Isadora, an idealized lover. The letters eventually formed the book Hawksley Burns for Isadora, from <b>Gutter</b> <b>Press</b> in Toronto.|$|E
50|$|She {{emigrated to}} London in 1970 {{and for the}} next decade her main {{energies}} went into grass roots politics in Islington, North London, helping to set up and run a women's centre, an alternative newspaper, the Islington <b>Gutter</b> <b>Press,</b> and supporting anti-racist politics. It was a decade in which the extra-party Left was on the ascendant, but divided structurally and ideologically.|$|E
50|$|Yet he {{was often}} deceived by people who appealed to his kindly nature and both {{he and his wife}} {{suffered}} greatly from treachery by those they sought to help. Eventually he was to admit, ‘One can be too easily accessible.’ One such attack came from a young woman reporter from the <b>gutter</b> <b>press,</b> who first sought his help and then launched a vicious attack through “John Bull” a <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> magazine. The same woman later tried a similar trick with the Rev. Father, John Ward, but warned by the Archbishop, he was less easily duped. In his ecclesiastical capacity Sibley wore a black suit, black spats, purple stock, and a wide-brimmed hat with a rosette. He was a likeable old man with steady blue eyes behind his gold-rimmed glasses, very upright in stance and courteous in the extreme, yet underneath was a will of iron. Sibley himself suffered great pain from an enlarged prostate, and many persecutions but struggled on.|$|E
50|$|McCormack's first book, 1996's Dark Rides, was {{published}} by <b>Gutter</b> <b>Press,</b> a small Canadian press founded by Sam Hiyate {{as part of a}} mid-1990s boomlet in alternative publishing in Toronto. That first book was edited by Ken Sparling, who left his aggressively minimalist imprint on it and McCormack's emerging style. The author/editor relationship was reversed in 2005, when McCormack edited Sparling's For Those Whom God Has Blessed With Fingers.|$|E

50|$|On 10 December 1991, in a German {{television}} talkshow, {{the filmmaker}} Rosa von Praunheim revealed that Kerkeling, among others, was gay. Kerkeling's {{comment on the}} ensuing fuss (mostly in the <b>gutter</b> <b>press)</b> was that while anyone of a more sensitive nature than him would probably have climbed into the bath with a hairdryer, {{he could not see}} the point: they would be dragging another poor soul through the dirt the next day anyway.|$|E
50|$|His body {{of writing}} {{includes}} the Vic Valentine series (Love Stories Are Too Violent For Me, Fate Is My Pimp/Romance Takes A Raincheck, and I Lost My Heart In Hollywood/Diary of a Dick), Lavender Blonde, and Down A Dark Alley.

5000|$|Nový čas {{was founded}} in 1990 after the Velvet Revolution , {{initially}} as a rough copy of the Austrian Kronen Zeitung. The newspaper is owned and published by Ringier Slovakia a.s., a Swiss company. The former owner of the paper was Gruner + Jahr. Its content is <b>gutter</b> <b>press.</b> The widely read supplement [...] "Nový čas víkend" [...] is added on Saturdays. In 2006 a Sunday version of Nový čas was introduced: Nový čas Nedeľa (New Time Sunday).|$|E
50|$|When {{he retired}} in 1929, he {{determined}} to devote his declining years {{to the service of}} God, and after his consecration by Lloyd in 1929, returned to England as Archbishop Metropolitan of the Orthodox Catholic Church in the British Empire. Unfortunately in this new role he rapidly attracted enemies in the established Church who often employed agent provocateurs and the <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> against him. Despite this persecution he was always the perfect gentleman, and there was a firm chin under his George V beard.|$|E
5000|$|Even famous women-politicians {{and public}} figures are {{sometimes}} abused in the <b>gutter</b> <b>press,</b> {{and you may}} see a porno collage or drawing including {{the face of a}} famous politician. The New View (Novy Vzglyad) magazine, for instance, published an article in June 1994 which was entitled [...] "Bitches - Big and Small", in which all famous Russian women-leaders of the past and presentwere derided, and nobody even thought of taking the authors to court, while if the subject had been man-politician proceedings would no doubt have started.|$|E
50|$|Adam was {{the main}} {{influence}} on Franz in his early years, as both teacher and manager. Liszt's full musical maturity was reached after his father died, {{when he heard the}} works of such composers as Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumacher. The big influence on his performing style once Adam was gone came from his meetings with the forty year old Paganini. Though he always honoured the memory of Adam, who had been accused by the French <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> of exploiting the child prodigy, he never visited Adam's grave at Boulogne-sur-Mer.|$|E
50|$|My Name Is Legion is a {{novel by}} A. N. Wilson first {{published}} in 2004. Set in London {{in the first years}} of the 21st century, the book revolves around two main topics: Britain's <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> and Christian religion. On the one hand, the novel satirises the detrimental influence yellow journalism can have on individuals, society and politics both domestic and international. On the other hand, My Name Is Legion discusses the role of the churches in contemporary civil society, of faith in a secularised world, and of evil as an undeniable force in our lives—why it exists (leading to the theological question of theodicy) and what believers can actively do to make the world a better place to live in.|$|E
50|$|Its {{operation}} {{was made possible}} by the arrival of inexpensive photolithography that permitted printing without typesetting. Before the arrival of Desk-Top Publishing it was typed, with the typewritten sections pasted up onto master sheets using Cow Gum, with headlines in Letraset. The first 66 issues were in A4, but from issue 67 the Voice changed to A3 newsprint and from Issue 72 to A2 newsprint. It was first printed by Voice personnel on a small press owned {{by a member of the}} collective and then at a squat in Islington, North London but printing was quickly moved back to Brighton. In the early days doing the printing yourself was part of the philosophy of those involved. Bankruptcy of the printer and a subsequent suspicious fire meant that printing had to be moved back to London on two occasions, to be printed by another alternative paper, the Islington <b>Gutter</b> <b>Press.</b> Later, to accommodate the new format, it was printed in Bristol.|$|E
5000|$|On December 6, 2008 {{broadcast}} of Najgori od sve dece, Maca aroused more controversy as he reacted to a Puls magazine piece in which journalist Milica Crnogorac criticizes his presenting style. Maca said in live programme: [...] "Id {{like to use}} this opportunity to say hi to a certain Milica Crnogorac, some excuse for a journalist who thinks she {{has the right to}} spit on me and my colleagues. Listen to me, Milica, mind your own business or youll end up like Petar Luković". Some took that as a threat, and the subject was carried in various Ringier print publications in Serbia, however Maca explained that he meant that as a metaphor for Lukovics professional failure as this formerly respected journalist now writes for <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> weekly Scandal!. However, the issue even led to Ringier AG announcing intention to boycott Emotion Production and their TV projects in their print publications in Serbia. The issue was later resolved.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{publications}} such as IT and Oz, both {{of which}} had a national circulation, the 1960s and 1970s saw {{the emergence of a}} whole range of local alternative newspapers, which were usually published monthly. These were largely made possible by the introduction in the 1950s of offset litho printing, which was much cheaper than traditional typesetting and use of the rotary letterpress. Such local papers included Aberdeen Peoples Press, Alarm (Swansea), Andersonstown News (Belfast), Brighton Voice, Bristol Voice, Feedback (Norwich), Hackney People's Press, Islington <b>Gutter</b> <b>Press,</b> Leeds Other Paper, Response (Earl's Court, London), Sheffield Free Press, and the West Highland Free Press. A 1980 review identified some 70 such publications around the United Kingdom but estimated that the true number could well have run into hundreds. Such papers were usually published anonymously, for fear of the UK's draconian libel laws. They followed a broad anarchist, libertarian, left-wing of the Labour Party, socialist approach but the philosophy of a paper was usually flexible as those responsible for its production came and went. Most papers were run on collective principles.|$|E
40|$|A new {{review of}} print {{works at the}} Art Wharepuke Print Center in New Zealand of Two well-Known British Mid-Career Printmakers (Stephen Mumberson and Chris Pig) who work with similar concerns. Mumberson's {{etchings}} relate to everyday life and direct visual narratives of the humorous and violent events seen. Strongly sourced and coloured by popular British culture, the imagery ranges from fantasies conjured by events {{or as part of}} the <b>gutter</b> <b>press</b> panic over an issue. In this sense Mumberson follows in a long tradition of British graphic art extending back to the earliest introduction of printmaking to these isles. Both artists share an intimacy with their nations charter which is describe in their chosen form of print...|$|E
