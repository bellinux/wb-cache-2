5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E

5|$|The {{pointing}} man has variously {{been described}} as either the patron of the work (Fraenger in 1947), as an advocate of Adam denouncing Eve (Dirk Bax in 1956), as Saint John the Baptist in his camel's skin (Isabel Mateo Goméz in 1963), or as a self-portrait. The woman below him lies within a semicylindrical transparent shield, while <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> is sealed, devices implying that she bears a secret. To their left, a man crowned by leaves lies on top of {{what appears to be}} an actual but gigantic strawberry, and is joined by a male and female who contemplate another equally huge strawberry.|$|E
5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|That night, Natalie sneaks into Dylan's house. When they kiss, {{something}} apparently cuts <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{causing her}} to leave in tears. Dare's friends, who believe Dylan is responsible for his death, pull up moments later and abduct him. During the drive, an insect-like protrusion comes out of Dylan's mouth and sprays webbing everywhere, causing the car to flip and crash. Doggett and Reyes arrive at the scene, and are told that Dylan chewed his way out the back window. Meanwhile, Scully and a bug specialist search Dylan's home. Scully leaves to help Reyes find the teenager while the specialist stays behind; the specialist is subsequently attacked by Dylan's mother.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E

5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} chooses the Truth door, Tapp pursues a mysterious cloaked figure who he {{believes}} to be Jigsaw. After catching and brutally beating the figure, Tapp realizes {{that it is}} actually Melissa Sing, a victim whom Tapp had saved earlier in the game. A tape found on Melissa explains that Jigsaw had put her in charge of keeping Tapp alive and making sure he followed the rules of Jigsaw's game after Tapp rescued her. Jigsaw had kidnapped her son and had Pighead sew <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> shut to avoid her spoiling Tapp's test. Attempting {{to run away from}} Tapp, Melissa desperately charges through a nearby door rigged with a shotgun, which kills her {{in the same way as}} her late husband, Steven Sing. Tapp suffers a mental breakdown as a result of her death and is placed in a functional asylum where he still believes he is playing Jigsaw's games.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana {{presents}} a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here the sage is Vashista {{and the king}} is Vishwamitra. Once, king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista. The sage welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, the sage refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary {{for the performance of}} the sacred rituals and charity by the sage. Agitated, Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king's men. She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king's army and the sage followed her wish. Intensely, she produced Pahlava warriors, who were slain by Vishwamita's army. So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage. From <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> emerged the Kambhojas, from her udder Barvaras, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores on her skin, Haritas, Kiratas and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra's army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista.|$|E
25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E
