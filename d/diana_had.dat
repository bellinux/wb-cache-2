For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns {{mounted on the}} side of her bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes.

5|$|The Fifth Earl {{also built}} the Grade II* listed Gardener's House {{at the back}} of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head {{gardener}} of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> been intent on living in the house following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, The Shipwrecked Mariner, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from a raft. Charles Spencer has since moved it from the main portico of Gardener's House to the main house.|$|E

25|$|Within a month, Diana began seeing Dodi Fayed, {{the son of}} her summer host, Mohamed Al-Fayed. <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> {{considered}} {{taking her}} sons that summer on a holiday to the Hamptons on Long Island, New York, but security officials had prevented it. After deciding against a trip to Thailand, she accepted Fayed's invitation to join his family {{in the south of}} France, where his compound and large security detail would not cause concern to the Royal Protection squad. Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the Jonikal, a 60-metre multimillion-pound yacht on which to entertain Diana and her sons.|$|E

Suggestions that Harry's father is not Charles but James Hewitt, with whom <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> an affair, are based on alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry; however, Harry was born before the affair began.|$|E

25|$|Through the machinations of an A.I. {{satellite}} called Brother Eye, {{a military}} strike was made against Themyscira {{in an attempt}} at Amazon genocide. A large swarm of OMAC units {{were sent to the}} island and began to attack the Amazons as part of the events of Infinite Crisis. Because of this, as well as the many previous attacks against the island since <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> become Wonder Woman, it was decided by Artemis and Philippus that the entire island of Themyscira and all of its inhabitants (sans Diana) would be transported to a hidden dimension via the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses. Artemis and the remaining Amazons thrive in this dimension for a year's time in peace.|$|E
25|$|On 17June 1896, Jackson met a {{stranger}} at Cape Flora, who he soon recognized as Nansen. He and Johansen stayed as Jackson's guests for several weeks, {{with the two}} parties sharing knowledge of the archipelago.

Jackson stayed for the next winter and the following spring, along with Albert Armitage, circumnavigated {{the western part of the}} archipelago in a period of eight weeks. Two whaling vessels, Balæna and <b>Diana,</b> <b>had</b> already arrived before the Windward landed on 22July. With insufficient supplies for another full winter, the expedition packed up and returned to the mainland on6August. Supplies were left at Elmwood in the hope that they would assist any future stranded expeditions.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to being}} in the demon dimension, Queen Hippolyta began to see visions of the future. One of those visions {{included}} Wonder Woman dying. Keeping this to herself, she called for a new Contest {{for the title of}} Wonder Woman, claiming that she felt that <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> proven inadequate in the role despite Diana's insistence that the world outside was more complicated than they had imagined. Initially excluding the new Amazons, Queen Hippolyta submitted to a vote on the whole to include them at Diana's behest. Through some mystical managing on Hippolyta's part, Artemis eventually won the Contest and became the new Wonder Woman. Hippolyta then declared to both tribes that she considered Artemis her own daughter for winning the Contest, and during her entire tenure as Wonder Woman Artemis wore Diana's tiara. As gifts to aid her in her new mission, Artemis was given several magical objects. The Gauntlet of Atlas which increased its wearer's strength by ten times, The Sandals of Hermes which gave the gift of speed and flight, and the golden Lasso of Truth which forced anyone tied by it to speak only the truth.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew were}} kept in {{separate}} cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor handed him {{a letter from the}} remaining officers of the Diana who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of Sakhalin {{in the name of the}} Tsar. The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference. The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian spy. The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in Matsumae.|$|E
25|$|Eventually Wonder Woman {{found their}} city while {{searching for the}} villain The Cheetah, who had stolen her golden Lasso of Truth. As the Bana-Mighdallian's {{original}} Themyscirian language had changed over time to incorporate Middle Eastern dialects, <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> a hard time communicating with the newly found Amazons. Eventually a battle took place {{between her and the}} Bana-Mighdallian's chief warrior or Shim'Tar. Soon an enraged Olympian god Hermes, who was in love with Diana, took vengeance on the desert Amazons for attacking his beloved, and the city of Bana-Mighdall was destroyed. Homeless, the remaining Amazons eventually took up with the witch Circe who was a nemesis of Wonder Woman. It was agreed that in exchange for their servitude during the events of the War of the Gods Circe would grant them immortality and a new home to call their own. It was decided that since the Themyscirian princess was the initial cause of their city being destroyed, they would take over her Amazon city instead. Though only fourteen years of age at this time, Artemis spoke before the Queen and Council to protest the planned attack as she felt that Amazons must not war against each other. Her cries were ignored and the attack was undertaken.|$|E
25|$|After Golovnin's capture, Rikord {{returned}} to Kamchatka to gain permission {{to attempt to}} rescue which was granted by the governor of Kamchatka as well having a document condemning Chwostoff's raid given to him. He then attempted contact with the Japanese on Kunashir, and was met with cannon fire and {{the message that the}} captured Russians were all dead. In retaliation for the capture of Golovnin, commander Petr Rikord of the Diana detained the Japanese ship Kansai Maru and took captive the wealthy merchant Takadaya Kahei as well as symbolically retaining four other Japanese and a Kurile whilst releasing {{the rest of the crew}} on Kunashir. This action brought the two countries on the brink of war. In March, 1813 the new governor arrived prohibiting the firing on of Russian ships. To assure the Russians of their continuing survival, Golovnin and Moor wrote to Rikord informing them that they were still alive. However, two of the Japanese and one of the Ainu had died in captivity in Kamchatka (seemingly of scurvy). Moor, scared of retaliation by the Russians when he was released, endeavoured to upset the exchange of prisoners by warning that the Russians would attack the Japanese. Negotiations were made between Rikord, the governor of Hokkaido and the Japanese Government in Edo, in which the Japanese were convinced that Chwostoff's action had not been condoned by the Russian government and that the crew of the <b>Diana</b> <b>had</b> gone to the Kurils without mal-intent towards the Japanese. Kakadaya Kahei was released on 29 July as a show of good intention by Rikord. An agreement was finally reached to negotiate with Rikord and offer safe passage to the Diana and Golovnin was released from prison in August 1813 with copies of all their negotiations with the Japanese as well as those of Resanov and Laxman to present to the Russian government. The Diana arrived in late September, and after deliberations with the governor, Golovnin and his crew were officially released on 6 October.|$|E
