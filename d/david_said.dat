500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her.

500|$|The most {{important}} thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", <b>David</b> <b>said.</b> Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie [...] "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it [...] "made more sense" [...] to make the characters older.|$|E

Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up!, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show.

[...] Because Paul Wellstone's brother had suffered from mental illness, Wellstone had fought for changes in mental health and insurance laws when he reached the Senate.|$|E

During the Second Reading of the Amendment Bill, the Chief Secretary of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, Edgeworth Beresford <b>David,</b> <b>said</b> that such powers were needed to combat gang fights or other crimes committed by secret society members, particularly violent conflict between such societies.

2500|$|Rav Kruspedai said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan that on Rosh Hashanah, three books are opened in Heaven — one for the {{thoroughly}} wicked, one for the thoroughly righteous, and one for those in between. The thoroughly righteous are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of life. The thoroughly wicked are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of death. And the fate of those in between is suspended from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. If they deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of life; if they do not deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of death.
