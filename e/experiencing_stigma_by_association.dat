40|$|If {{there were}} a stigma scale for chemotherapy, alkylating agents would be ranked {{at the top of}} the list. The {{chemical}} term alkylation is associated with nonselective toxicity, an association that dates back to the use of nitrogen mustards during World War I as chemical warfare agents. That this stigma persists and extends to compounds that, through selectivity, attempt to “tame” the indiscriminate destructive potential of alkylation is the subject of this review. Selective alkylation, as it is referred to herein, constitutes an extremely nascent and dynamic field in oncology. The pharmacodynamic response to this selective strategy depends on a delicate kinetic balance between specificity and the rate and extent of binding. Three representative compounds are presented: RRx- 001, 3 -bromopyruvate, and TH- 302. The main impetus for the development of these compounds has been the avoidance of the serious complications of traditional alkylating agents; therefore, it is the thesis of this review that they should not <b>experience</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Relatives {{of people}} with mental {{illnesses}} are affected in many different areas of life, and are often concerned that their ill family members might be of danger to themselves or others. The aim of this presentation is to report some results from Swedish studies of relatives focusing on stigma, family burden, participation in care, and attitudes towards coercive treatment. Methods: In three different data collection periods in a longitudinal project, in all 455 relatives of committed and voluntarily admitted patients were interviewed, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: A majority of relatives experienced psychological factors of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Relatives‘ burden and participation in care were {{not found to be}} associated to violent behaviour by the patients or to the patients‘ diagnoses, but relatives of patients with suicide attempts scored higher on some of the burden and participation items than other relatives. Relatives reported stronger support for coercion {{in order to protect the}} patient than for easing family burden and protecting others. Conclusion: The results indicate that relatives of psychiatric patients <b>experience</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and low participation in care, but in general support the need for compulsory psychiatric care in specific situations. However, despite a heavy burden due to the patients‘ mental illnesses, relatives do not primarily call for coercion in order to ease the family burden. There is a need for the psychiatric services to involve and support relatives of patients with suicidal behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{document}} the levels of HIV <b>stigma</b> reported <b>by</b> persons living with HIV infections and nurses in Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland and Tanzania over a 1 -year period. HIV stigma has been shown to negatively affect the quality of life for people living with HIV infection, their adherence to medication, and their access to care. Few studies have documented HIV <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> as <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> nurses or other health care workers who care for people living with HIV infection. This study used standardised scales to measure the level of HIV stigma over time. A repeated measures cohort design was used to follow persons living with HIV infection and nurses involved in their care from five countries over a 1 -year period in a three-wave longitudinal design. The average age of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) (N= 948) was 36. 15 years (SD= 8. 69), and 67. 1 % (N= 617) were female. The average age of nurses (N= 887) was 38. 44 years (SD= 9. 63), and 88. 6 % (N= 784) were females. Eighty-four per cent of all PLHAs reported one or more HIV-stigma events at baseline. This declined, but was still significant 1 year later, when 64. 9 % reported experiencing at least one HIV-stigma event. At baseline, 80. 3 % of the nurses reported experiencing one or more HIV-stigma events and this increased to 83. 7 % 1 year later. The study documented high levels of HIV <b>stigma</b> as reported <b>by</b> both PLHAs and nurses in all five of these African countries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} phenomenon of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> between firms {{in the context of}} corporate accounting scandals. I draw from the social psychology literature to develop a theoretical framework that supports the notion of director interlocks as a channel in which associated firms may <b>experience</b> <b>stigma.</b> I argue that allegations of corporate accounting scandal generate attributional search by investors to determine the cause(s) of the alleged scandal. Attribution theory suggests that investors are likely to attribute responsibility to corporate boards for failing to detect and prevent these scandals. Investors?????? perceptions of incompetent and/or unwilling directors in firms accused of accounting scandals may then spill over to directorship positions in associated firms, resulting in the stigmatization of these associated firms. The results strongly support the above arguments. I further adopted an information-based approach to argue that firms associated with stigmatized firms will experience different amounts of stigma, and some firms may <b>experience</b> no <b>stigma</b> at all. I applied social inference theories and agency theory to develop four categories of variables that may influence the amount of <b>stigma</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> associated firms. The results of the dissertation present strong evidence in support of most of the hypotheses. The characteristics of the interlocking director, the characteristics of the board, the strength of the director interlock, and the quality of corporate governance in an associated firm appear to influence the amount of <b>stigma</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> the associated firm. This dissertation highlights the possible (1) negative consequences of director interlocks, (2) understatement of the social costs of corporate accounting scandals, and (3) need for response strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association...</b>|$|R

Evidence consistently shows that an individual’s attribution of disease cause can prompt or justify interpersonal stigma. However, few studies have explored causal beliefs about inherited disease and their influence on stigmatising behaviours in low and middle income countries. Design and methods: The {{study was conducted in}} 2013, in six communities in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 1800 respondents took part in the study, 600 were affected by an inherited disease and 1200 were unaffected neighbours. Two versions of the interviewer- administered survey were created, with measures assessed in parallel on <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> for the affected and enacted stigma for unaffected respondents.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} public <b>stigma,</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> (SBA), psychological distress, perceived closeness, perceived heredity, {{and the type of}} family relationship among family members of people with a mental illness. Method: In this cross-sectional survey, data from 527 family members of people with a mental illness were analyzed. Results: Perceptions of public stigma were found to be positively related to SBA and SBA correlated with greater psychological distress and less perceived closeness. SBA also mediated relationships between perceived public stigma and psychological distress, and between perceived public stigma and perceived closeness. Further, among participants who reported SBA, immediate family members showed lower levels of perceived closeness than extended family members. Also, the perceived heredity of mental illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress.

40|$|HIV/AIDS-related stigma is a {{recognised}} {{problem for}} {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) yet little research on <b>experiences</b> of <b>stigma</b> has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicentre of the disease. ? This paper employs quantitative analysis to measure the extent and nature of <b>stigma</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> 242 people on antiretroviral treatment in Khayelitsha (an urban African community in Cape Town, South Africa). This research draws an important distinction between <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> and perceived stigma (i. e. perceptions of stigma in the community). The results show that while relatively few respondents (17 %) reported experiencing a lot of stigma, the majority (75 %) had <b>experienced</b> some <b>stigma.</b> <b>Experiences</b> of <b>stigma</b> within households {{were found to be}} rare (thus adding to the emerging evidence of general support for PLWHA from family members). Although some reported no <b>experiences</b> of <b>stigma,</b> almost all individuals reported perceived stigma (i. e. believed they lived in a stigmatising environment). Both <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> and perceived stigma were related to inconsistent condom use, fear of disclosure, depression/anxiety and lack of self-efficacy/confidence. As expected, <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> influenced perceived stigma and those affiliated to a religious organisation were shown to manifest more perceived stigma. ? Health-related problems and the clinic where treatment was obtained (which could be a proxy for different social contexts) were significant determinants of <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma.</b> This indicates the importance of the biophysical manifestations of HIV/AIDS and community-level variables in shaping PLWHA's experiences and fears of stigma...|$|R

Overall, 146 relevant studies were found, 38 of which were applicable to this review, 10 pertaining to associative stigma in the AOD field, and 3 reporting results related to AOD workers specifically. Findings indicated that although the stigmatisation of AOD workers occurs, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the phenomenon. Consequently, strategies used to manage stigma in the AOD field lack an empirical basis. Research is needed to clarify the origins, manifestations, and impacts of stigma in relation to working in the AOD field...|$|R
40|$|Not only do {{transgender}} female {{sex workers}} {{have some of}} the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma,</b> they also have higher likelihood of early sexual debut and some of the lowest levels of educational attainment compared to other stigmatized populations. Some of the most common interventions designed to reduce transmission of HIV and STIs seek to educate high-risk groups on sexual health and encourage condom use across all partner types; however, reaching stigmatized populations, particularly those in resource-limited settings, is particularly challenging. Considering the importance of condom use in stopping the spread of HIV, the aim of this study was two-fold; first to characterize this hard-to-reach population of transgender female sex workers in the Dominican Republic, and second, to assess associations between their HIV knowledge, <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma,</b> and condom use across three partner types. We analyzed self-reported data from the Questionnaire for Transgender Sex Workers (N = 78). Respondents were interviewed at their workplaces. Univariate and bivariate analyses were employed. Fisher Chi-square tests assessed differences in HIV knowledge and <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> condom use across partner types. HIV knowledge was alarmingly low, condom use varied across partner type, and the respondents in our sample had high levels of <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma.</b> Average age of first sexual experience was 13. 12 years with a youngest age reported of 7. Dominican Republic statutory rape laws indicate 18 years is the age of consent; thus, many of these transgender women's first sexual encounters would be considered forcible (rape) and constitute a prosecutable crime. On average, respondents reported 8. 45 sexual partners in the prior month, with a maximum of 49 partners. Approximately two thirds of respondents used a condom the last time they had sex with a regular partner. This was considerably lower than condom use reported with coercive partners (92. 96 %) and clients (91. 78 %). Bivariate analyses revealed two trends: <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> was associated with lower rates of condom use, and lower HIV knowledge was associated with lower rates of condom use. The former provides additional evidence that <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> may become internalized, affecting individual-level behaviors-lowering self-confidence and resilience-making it more difficult to negotiate condom use due to lack of self-efficacy and desire to show trust in one's partner. The latter supports public health research that suggests gaps in HIV knowledge persist and are pronounced in highly stigmatized populations. The vulnerabilities experienced by transgender persons, particularly in environments that vehemently adhere to conservative ideologies related to sex and gender, are significant and harm this population. These vulnerabilities could potentially be addressed through critically examining of impact of policies that indirectly promote or allow victimization of transgender citizens and subsequently diminish the effectiveness of public health and educational interventions. By taking action through the revocation of such laws, the Dominican Republic has the opportunity to improve overall population health, to protect some of its most stigmatized citizens, and to become the flag bearer of enhanced human rights in the Caribbean and Latin America...|$|R
40|$|How can the {{diagnosis}} of HIV/AIDS result in a positive spiritual transformation (ST) ? The purpose of this sub-study is to identify special features of the experiences of individuals in whom HIV/AIDS diagnosis triggered a positive ST. We found ST triggered by HIV/AIDS to develop gradually, with a key adaptation phase after diagnosis in which the patient develops an individualized spirituality. Most participants (92 %) expressed having an individual connection to a higher presence/entity. Most (92 %) also described themselves as feeling more spiritual than religious (p < 0. 001). Religious professionals did not {{play a key role}} in fostering ST. Despite <b>experiencing</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> virtue of certain religious views, participants accepted themselves, which supported the process that we called “the triad of care taking”. This triad started with self-destructive behavior (92 %), such as substance use and risky sex, then transformed to developing self-care after diagnosis (adaptation) and gradually expanded in some (62 %) to compassionate care for others during ST. Spirituality did not trigger the adaption phase immediately after diagnosis, but contributed to long-lasting lifestyle changes. Overcoming self-reported depression, (92 % before diagnosis and in 8 % after ST) was a common feature. After the adaption phase, none of the participants blamed themselves, others or God for their HIV+ status. The prevailing view, rather, was that “God made them aware”. Our results suggest that it may be important to find ways to support people with HIV in feeling connected to a higher presence/entity, since this leads not only to a deeper connection with a higher presence/entity, but also to a deeper connection with oneself and to more responsible and caring behavior...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To draw on {{narrative}} {{interviews with}} patients with lung cancer {{and to explore}} their perceptions and <b>experience</b> of <b>stigma.</b> Design Qualitative study. Setting United Kingdom. Participants 45 patients with lung cancer recruited through several sources. Results Participants <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> commonly felt <b>by</b> patients {{with other types of}} cancer, but, whether they smoked or not, they felt particularly stigmatised because the disease is so strongly associated with smoking. Interaction with family, friends, and doctors was often affected as a result, and many patients, particularly those who had stopped smoking years ago or had never smoked, felt unjustly blamed for their illness. Those who resisted victim blaming maintained that the real culprits were tobacco companies with unscrupulous policies. Some patients concealed their illness, which sometimes had adverse financial consequences or made it hard for them to gain support from other people. Some indicated that newspaper and television reports may have added to the stigma: television advertisements aim to put young people off tobacco, but they usually portray a dreadful death, which may exacerbate fear and anxiety. A few patients were worried that diagnosis, access to care, and research into lung cancer might be adversely affected <b>by</b> the <b>stigma</b> attached to the disease and those who smoke. Conclusion Patients with lung cancer report stigmatisation with far reaching consequences. Efforts to help people to quit smoking are important, but clinical and educational interventions should be presented with care so as not to add to the <b>stigma</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> patients with lung cancer and other smoking related diseases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} relatives of those accused or convicted of serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, rape and sex offences. Relatives' accounts focus on {{the discovery of the}} offence as traumatic and life-changing, comparable in many ways to bereavement. Accounts of life before this point polarised and were either problem-identifying or normalising. Participants passed through several stages after discovering the offence as they began to feel they were coping and as the criminal justice process progressed. Responsibilities within the family were renegotiated and new responsibilities emerged which particularly revolved around the offender and his or her needs. Female relatives, and primarily mothers and wives, tended to take on these new tasks. Relatives <b>experience</b> secondary <b>stigma</b> because of their kin relationship to a serious offender, but this {{is more than just a}} <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Relatives are themselves subject to a 'web of shame' on the basis of contamination and blame. The thesis explores the accounts that relatives construct about the offence and about their own actions. When accounting for the offence, relatives were found to use 'actor adjustments' and 'act adjustments' of various types. Many participants were searching around for reasons and trying to understand why the offence had happened; formulating these accounts was part of that process. The thesis considers why relatives use self-help and what it offers. It is argued that self-help provides a 'collective narrative' for understanding experience which relatives use as a resource along with other sources to understand their circumstances. Most participants in the research were female, as are most participants in self-help services for relatives of offenders, and reasons for this are considered. The thesis is based upon in-depth interviews with 32 relatives of serious offenders and participant observation of a self-help organisation for families of serious offenders over several years...|$|R

The study employed qualitative methods to gather rich, contextualised data. Ten young people, aged between twelve to fourteen years old, participated in the research and each of the participants were interviewed on two occasions. Findings are presented across three chapters and they highlight the ways young people in foster care both preserve and build their access to social capital. Firstly, this includes the ways in which the young people are actively engaged in practices to manage and preserve their relationships and as a result their access to social capital. Secondly, findings show that young people in foster care <b>experience</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> virtue of having the status of being ‘in- care’, and in order to minimise this, the young people actively managed their spoiled identity (Goffman 1968), which allowed them to maintain access to social capital. Thirdly, the findings show that despite the experience of disrupted networks and multiple placement moves, given the opportunity, the participants demonstrated their ability to persevere in their attempts to start again, which built their access to social capital. This thesis offers a particular utility for the discipline of social work, by providing a way of understanding and theorising how young people continually work, in both prosaic and at times heroic ways, to minimise the disruption to their relationships, networks and their subsequent access to social capital...|$|R

40|$|Although public stigma {{towards the}} mentally ill is a known challenge, stigma from within the family has not been widely studied. This study aimed to compare the <b>experience</b> of <b>stigma</b> between mentally ill {{patients}} and diabetic controls, particularly focusing on stigma arising from family members. This is a cross sectional case control study. The case group consisted of 63 patients who attended the outpatient psychiatric clinic of Hospital Taiping. The control group consisted of 78 diabetic patients attending the outpatient medical clinic, Hospital Taiping and Selama Health Clinic. Patients completed questionnaire assessing <b>stigma</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>by</b> patients. Significantly higher percentage of psychiatric patients (55. 6 %) <b>experienced</b> <b>stigma</b> compared to diabetic patients (15. 4 %) (X 2 = 25. 3, p-value < 0. 0001). In addition, significantly higher percentage of patients with psychiatric illness received negative comments during the relapse of illness (57. 1 % vs 16. 7 %, chi-square = 5. 12, p-value = 0. 024) compared to diabetic patients. This study demonstrates that family members themselves could {{be a source of}} stigma. The findings support current family psycho-education programs in caring for {{the mentally ill}}...|$|R
