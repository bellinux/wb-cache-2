5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not <b>get</b> <b>really</b> involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who <b>get</b> <b>really</b> angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E

[...] Prior to the video's release, Rihanna posted a sneak peek of the video on YouTube. The official music video was released to VEVO on November 15, 2013.|$|E

Well, not really." [...] The {{exchange}} references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. At the end of the episode, John performs for Apu and Manjula {{on the roof of the}} Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Simpsons writer George Meyer said of the scene: [...] "You just see cards <b>get</b> <b>really</b> man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes." [...] In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is [...] "very popular" [...] in India, according to Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Chief Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a croissant in the store, to which Wiggum says [...] "Oh, that's right, they have breakfast at Tiffany's now."

[...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't <b>get</b> <b>really</b> good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E
