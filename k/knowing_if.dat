Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's Kiss of the Dragon). At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. troops dodged German {{machine gun}} and small arms fire {{on top of}} and under the bridge, moving from bridge girder to girder, cutting {{demolition}} wires and tossing explosive charges into the river, not <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the Germans would detonate {{the rest of them}} at any second.|$|E

25|$|Pyron's {{force of}} 300 camped at Apache Canyon, {{at one end}} of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 {{soldiers}} to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington’s men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to {{the two sides of the}} pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about a mile and a half (about 2=1/2 kilometers) to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington’s men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron’s men again and punished them with enfilade fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski’s Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.|$|E

500|$|The episode's teleplay was co-written by Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman, while Pinkner and Wyman co-wrote {{the story}} with {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. The writers wrote the script without <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the series {{was going to be}} renewed for a fourth season; Fox's renewal announcement came in late March, but no changes were made to the storyline. They designed the episode as a set-up for the following season, equating it to a book chapter that [...] "propels" [...] the reader forward. Unlike previous season finales, [...] "The Day We Died" [...] was one hour long and was linked to the previous two episodes in one continuous story arc. [...] "The Day We Died" [...] featured one-time guest actors Brad Dourif and Emily Meade.|$|E

Gibson's use of name-dropping brands {{to create a sense}} of [...] "in-group style … of those in the know" [...] is traced back to Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel V.. Gibson's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage, in this case) to drive the story. Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.|$|E

They {{had written the}} finale without <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> there would be another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal.
