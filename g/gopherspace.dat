Some even provided gateways, such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the Internet via UUCP, and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to Usenet. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search <b>gopherspace,</b> and interact with distant programs, all using plain text e-mail.|$|E
50|$|In this example, {{the item}} sent back is a gopher menu, a {{directory}} {{consisting of a}} sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as hypertext links, and so allow the user to navigate through <b>gopherspace</b> by following the links.|$|E
50|$|The master <b>Gopherspace</b> {{search engine}} is Veronica. Veronica offers a keyword search {{of all the}} public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search {{produces}} a menu of Gopher items, {{each of which is}} a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as Jughead and Jugtail.|$|E

50|$|A phlog, {{also called}} an rlog, {{is a type}} of daybook, similar to a blog, that runs off a Gopher {{protocol}} server. These phlogs are typically hosted from home servers running some sort of UNIX operating system, because a user account on the server is usually required to update the content. There are quite a few phlogs floating around <b>gopherspace</b> but the vast majority are not updated regularly.|$|E
50|$|As the Internet grew {{through the}} 1980s and early 1990s, many people {{realized}} the increasing {{need to be}} able to find and organize files and information. Projects such as Archie, Gopher, WAIS, and the FTP Archive list attempted to create ways to organize distributed data. In the early 1990s, Gopher, invented by Mark P. McCahill offered a viable alternative to the World Wide Web. However, in 1993 the World Wide Web saw many advances to indexing and ease of access through search engines, which often neglected Gopher and <b>Gopherspace.</b> As popularity increased through ease of use, investment incentives also grew until in the middle of 1994 the WWW's popularity gained the upper hand. Then it became clear that Gopher and the other projects were doomed fall short.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1980s, the joys of 'surfing the net,' began to excite the {{interest}} of people beyond the professional computer-using communities ... However, the existing computer networks were largely in government, higher education and business. They were not a free good and were not open to hobbyists or private firms that did not have access to a host computer. To fill this gap, a number of firms such as CompuServe, Prodigy, GEnie, and America Online sprang up to provide low cost network access ... While these networks gave access to Internet for e-mail (typically on a pay-per-message basis), they did not give the ordinary citizen access to the full range of the Internet, or to the glories of <b>gopherspace</b> or the World Wide Web. In a country whose Constitution enshrines freedom of information, most of its citizens were effectively locked out of the library of the future. The Internet was no longer a technical issue, but a political one. (1996:298).|$|E
5000|$|... {{there were}} {{approximately}} 160 gopher servers indexed by Veronica-2, reflecting a slow growth from 2007 {{when there were}} fewer than 100, although many are infrequently updated. Within these servers Veronica indexed approximately 2.5 million unique selectors. A handful of new servers are set up every year by hobbyists â€” over 50 {{have been set up}} and added to Floodgap's list since 1999. A snapshot of <b>Gopherspace</b> as it was in 2007 was circulated on BitTorrent and is still available. Due to the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, setting up new servers or adding Gopher support to browsers is often done in a tongue-in-cheek manner, principally on April Fools' Day. In November 2014 Veronica indexed 144 gopher servers, reflecting a small drop from 2012, but within these servers Veronica indexed approximately 3 million unique selectors. In March 2016 Veronica indexed 135 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4 million unique selectors. In March 2017 Veronica indexed 133 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4.9 million unique selectors.|$|E
