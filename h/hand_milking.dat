50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{work in a}} {{way that}} is different from <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for mastitis of cattle and the mean lactation number at which mastitis is more frequent. A retrospective based study was carried out in Khartoum and White Nile States in two farms, designated as Farm A and Farm B. Farm A practiced <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> twice daily; while Farm B used mainly machine milking, (with <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> to lesser extent) three times a day. A convenient sample of 94 lactating cows in Farm A and 690 lactating cows in Farm B was used for this study. A four years period data (2005 - 2008) were collected for FarmA and two years period data (2007 - 2008) for Farm B from health (mastitis), production and reproduction records. The data collected included number ofmastitis cases per day, lactation number, daily milk production in litres, number of lactating cows and type of milking used, including risk factors related to hygienic measures and management practices. These data were analyzed using SPSS software programme. The results revealed that there was a high prevalence of mastitis throughout the study area (34. 4 % inFarm A and 38. 9 % in Farm B). Lack of appropriate hygienic measures and management practices were reflected in the high prevalenceof mastitis inthe study area. viii The mean lactation numbers at which mastitis was more frequent were the third and second. To indicate which of the milking techniques (machine and <b>hand</b> <b>milking)</b> is a risk factor for bovine mastitis, odds ratiowas calculated using a 2 X 2 table. The odds ratio of 1. 3 indicates that <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> is a risk factor for bovine mastitis,meaning that cows which are hand milked are 1. 3 times more likely to get mastitis than those milked with machine. Accordingly, it may be recommended that special care must be directed towards cows at the third and the second lactations; and where <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> is practiced, application of rigorous hygienic measures should be considere...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was carried out to explore the {{potential}} source of contamination and the efficacy of different washing practices towards quality milk production. Materials and Methods: Probable sources of contamination viz. stored water, potable water, milker’s <b>hands,</b> <b>milking</b> pail, udder of individual buffalo and milk cans were subjected to different types of bacterial counts before the actual experiment to start. Twenty milch buffaloes thereafter were divided randomly into four treatment groups where washing was performed in each step viz. milker hands, udder of individual buffalo, milking pail and milk cans before milking either with water (T 0 : stored water, T 1 : potable water) or sanitizers (T 2 : 200 ppm chlorine solution, T 3 : 50 ppm iodophore solution) for 60 days. Bacterial counts again were performed for last 5 alternate days for all the sources involved along with the microbial load of raw milk. Data obtained were subjected to standard statistical analysis. Results: It was found that for all bacterial count stored water contributed significantly higher {{as compared to the}} potable water. Among the other potential sources of contamination (log/ 6 cm 2), standard plate count (SPC) and coliform count were significantly highest for milking pail (6. 73 ± 0. 02) and udder of milch buffaloes (3. 77 ± 0. 12), respectively, while for Staphylococci count both milking pail (3. 24 ± 0. 02) and milking can (3. 22 ± 0. 04) were contributed maximally (p 0. 05) for most of the parameters, even for the raw milk quality. Conclusion: Study revealed that milker <b>hands,</b> <b>milking</b> pails, udder of animals, milk cans and stored water used for washing of equipment are the potential source of contamination in raw milk. These were counted as critical point which needs attention for the production of high-quality milk. Potable water was found to be better than stored water. The use of either chlorine 200 ppm and iodophor 50 ppm is highly effective in reducing the bacterial population for quality milk production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Twenty-four Red Sokoto goats were <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> for 120 days to {{determine}} milk flow rate. The does were grouped into three for once, twice and thrice a day milking {{to determine}} the effect of milking frequency on milk flow rate. The average daily milk yield and milk flow rate was 466. 9 g and 3. 5 g/sec, respectively. Milking frequency significantly (P< 0. 01) influenced milk yield and milk flow rate. The higher the milking frequency, the higher the milk yield, but with a decreasing flow rate. Milk yield and milk flow rate were significantly (P< 0. 01) and positively correlated (r = 0. 88). Both milk yield and flow rate reached their peak at the 4 week of production. The optimum milking frequency for Red Sokoto goat in this study was the twiceth daily milking, since there was 52. 7 % increase in milk yield from once a day, with a marginal 7. 9 % reduction in milk flow rate...|$|R
