The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors.

40|$|Spatial <b>distance</b> is a {{critical}} component of theories across the social, natural, and information sciences, but too often the methods and metrics used to describe spatial <b>distance</b> are implicit or underspecified. How <b>distance</b> is measured may influence model results in unanticipated ways. We examined the differences among <b>distances</b> calculated in three ways: Euclidean <b>distances,</b> vector-based road-network <b>distances,</b> and raster-based cost-weighted <b>distances.</b> We applied these different measures to the case of the economic value of open space, which is frequently derived using hedonic pricing (HP) models. In HP models, <b>distance</b> to open space is used to quantify access for residential properties. Under the assumption that vector-based road <b>distances</b> better match actual travel <b>distance</b> between homes and open spaces, we compared these <b>distances</b> with Euclidean and raster-based cost-weighted <b>distances,</b> finding that the <b>distance</b> values themselves differed significantly. Open-space values estimated using these <b>distances</b> in hedonic models differed greatly and values for Euclidean and cost-weighted <b>distances</b> to open space were much lower than those for road-network <b>distances.</b> We also highlight computational issues that can lead to counterintuitive effects in <b>distance</b> calculations. We recommend the use of road-network <b>distances</b> in valuing open space using HP models and caution against the use of Euclidean and cost-weighted <b>distances</b> unless there are compelling theoretical reasons to do so. ...|$|R

5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith.

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began <b>distancing</b> himself from the {{political}} and social issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E

40|$|Separation {{of animals}} and humans using a {{protective}} set-back <b>distance</b> (Minimum Ap-proaching <b>Distance)</b> is a popular tool for conservation managers to promote wildlife-hu-man coexistence. In several cases, Minimum Approaching <b>Distance</b> is based on how ani-mals respond to an approaching human, using Flight Initiation <b>Distance</b> or Alert <b>Distance.</b> Alert <b>Distance,</b> when animals first show increased vigilance to an approaching human, is considered the best basis for Minimum Approaching <b>Distance</b> because animals have time to adapt their response. Alert <b>Distance</b> is frequently difficult or impossible to measure in practice, however, especially in breeding birds. Using a study of breeding Wood Sandpip-ers Tringa glareola, in which Alert <b>Distance</b> could not be measured directly, we tested three possible solutions to this dilemma. Alarm Call <b>Distance</b> {{did not appear to}} provide a useful substitute for Alert <b>Distance</b> because sandpipers probably alarm called after they had first detected a human. Published predictions of Alert <b>Distance</b> using body mass also failed to provide realistic estimates of disturbance <b>distances</b> in Wood Sandpipers. The “fixed-slope rule”, which predicts that Alert <b>Distance</b> is about double Flight Initiation <b>Distance,</b> was not supported by relationships between Alarm Call <b>Distance</b> and Flight Ini-tiation <b>Distance,</b> but was supported by a relationship between an estimated Alert <b>Distance</b> surrogate and Flight Initiation <b>Distance.</b> This suggests that this rule may have general util-ity in predicting Alert <b>Distance</b> when only the more readily measured Flight Initiation <b>Distance</b> metric is known.

5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus <b>distancing</b> dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E

The physical <b>distancing</b> techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground.
