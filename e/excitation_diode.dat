The time-resolved spectroscopy of CIS/ZnS 555 [*]nm and CIS/ZnS 665 [*]nm reveals {{the correlation between the}} fast, intermediate, and slow decay components and the interface-trapped state and shallow- and deep-trapped states, although the fractional amplitudes of photoluminescence (PL) decay components are widely distributed throughout the entire spectra. The temperature-resolved spectroscopy explains that the PL from deep-trapped donor-acceptor (DA) state has relatively large thermal quenching, due to the relative Coulomb interaction of DA pairs, compared to the thermal quenching of PL from interface defect state and shallow-trapped DA state. A good spectral coupling between the blue <b>diode</b> <b>excitation</b> and the PL from CIS/ZnS leads to the realization of hybrid white LEDs...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{steady-state}} and optical modulation characteristics of a luminescence down-converting colloidal quantum dot/polyimide nanocomposite system suitable for integration with gallium nitride optoelectronics. The approach provides solution-processable and environmentally stable composite materials whose optical conversion and intrinsic modulation properties were evaluated at wavelengths from 535 to 624 nm. A nanocomposite for white-light generation upon excitation and mixing with 450 -nm light was also obtained by blending colloidal quantum dots of different sizes in the same matrix. The forward external quantum efficiencies of the resulting nanocomposites were found {{to depend on the}} wavelength and can be as high as 33 %. Optical modulation bandwidth above 25 MHz, which is an order of magnitude higher than for typical phosphor-based color-converters for GaN LEDs, and wavelength-converted data with an open-eye diagram at 25 Mb/s are demonstrated under external gallium nitride light-emitting <b>diode</b> <b>excitation.</b> These modulation characteristics are correlated with carrier lifetimes. This work provides guideline parameters and creates a possible path to integrated hybrid visible light sources for scientific and communications applicatio...|$|R
