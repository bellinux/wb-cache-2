40|$|The essay {{discusses}} {{the legacy of}} Le Corbuiser in contemporary urban redevelopment and city planning with {{the example of the}} <b>Diagonal</b> Mar <b>Park</b> in Barcelona. Designed the Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue and completed in 2000, <b>Diagonal</b> Mar <b>Park</b> presents a scenario which recalls the urban model elaborated and proposed since the 1920 s by Le Corbusier: an uninterrupted green plain, shaped as a sequence of organized open spaces and playgrounds, from which high-density residential blocks are raised. If, during the 1970 s and 1980 s, the urban model proposed by Le Corbusier was refused, the essay argues that his ideas of conceiving the city as an immense park seems to be still suitable for the contemporary metropolis. The intervention of urban renewal for Barcelona, centred in the <b>Diagonal</b> Mar <b>Park,</b> brings the mark of Le Corbusier’s ideas of combining a continuous pattern of green areas to residential districts, the diffused green acting as connective tissue between different parts of the city...|$|R

50|$|Lombard Avenue (6200 West) is {{the western}} boundary. Nothing differentiates the two municipalities; no signs or {{landmarks}} announce the invisible border, {{and the street}} layout and building styles do not change. The U.S. Postal Service has a large facility at 6625 West Cermak in the 60402 zip code. At Wesley (6700 West), Riverside Drive angles off to the southwest towards the eponymous suburb designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The road's width decreases here, at {{the western end of}} the grass and tree lined median and <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> spaces, to two traffic lanes, a parallel parking lane, wide sidewalk and abutting storefront buildings on either side. At the southwest corner of Oak Park Avenue (6800 West) is the restored American State Bank building, built in 1925 and now home to the Big Hurt Brewhouse restaurant. At the southeast corner of Harlem Avenue (Illinois Route 43), is the Cermak Plaza, an early shopping center which opened in 1956. The noted Spindle sculpture, a tall spike impaling eight cars, decorated the parking lot until its May 2, 2008 dismantlement.|$|E
50|$|Dixieanne is a {{neighborhood}} situated in North Sacramento. Its boundaries are El Camino Avenue to the north, Arden Way to the south, Evergreen Street to the east, and Del Paso Boulevard to the North/West. This neighborhood {{is home to}} the recently renovated Dixieanne Park, which includes, a new skate park. A unique neighborhood with hidden charm, due to the fact, that it is very close to the original Del Paso Boulevard; which was completely revamped from four to two lanes, with parallel parking transitioning to <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking.</b> The boulevard is full of Art Deco architecture, and is classified by the city as a redevelopment area. This neighborhood is walking distance to the Arden/Del Paso RT light rail station and adjacent bus stops. There are many fast food chains and mom and pop shops on this boulevard and nearby El Camino Avenue. This neighborhood, like most of remaining North Sacramento has an increasing crime rate. It is known for its Dixieanne Apartment compound which was condemned by the city because of high crime rates; with the intent of clearing the area of unsightly eyesores as part of the new redevelopment plan.|$|E

50|$|Returning to the League after midweek {{victory in}} Europe, United faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford. This {{was the second}} meeting between the two teams in 12 days after United overcame Wolves 3-2 in the League Cup. United {{struggled}} to gain a grip on {{the game in the}} first half but were the first to break the deadlock right on the stroke of time, Darren Fletcher bisecting the Wolves defence with a pass to Park Ji-sung, who converted the chance. Wolves made changes in the second half, bringing on Sylvan Ebanks-Blake and Steven Fletcher, and it was the former United youth team player Ebanks-Blake who equalised, slotting the ball through the legs of Edwin van der Sar from close range. United pressed for a winner in the final minutes of the game, introducing Federico Macheda and Paul Scholes into the game, and it paid dividends in the 93rd minute as Fletcher played a <b>diagonal</b> ball to <b>Park,</b> who drifted infield and squeezed the ball past Marcus Hahnemann for his second of the game, giving United the 2-1 victory. The game also marked the comeback of Owen Hargreaves, making his first start in nearly two years. The comeback was truncated, however, as he limped off the field after 5 minutes due to a hamstring injury.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{develop a}} method for {{determining}} the optimal size and placement of parking spaces and approach aisles for an automobile parking lot. In particular, our solution concerns a parking lot of size 100 ' x 200 ' located {{at the corner of}} an intersection of two streets in a New England town. We begin by arguing the superiority of driver operation over attendant operation of vehicles to be parked. Then a statistical analysis is performed on a sampling of 160 1987 model automobiles to determine upper bounds and ideal values for the length and width of a parking space and for the turning radius required to navigate entrance into said space. Using this data, we show that the optimal degree for <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> which minimizes necessary lot area for a particular space can be expressed {{as a function of the}} turning radius of the automobile and the width of the parking space. However, concerning our particular lot, right-angle parking is established as the method by which optimal use of space can be achieved by showing that to minimize wasted area using the <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> scheme requires a greater number of spaces than can be accommodated in the given dimensions. Using these preliminary results, a computer program which utilizes a 12 -way tree structure and recursion is employed to generate possible lot designs. Next, other considerations not so conducive to programming—such as snow removal, lot use fees and effects of our design on the adjacent intersection—are discussed...|$|E
40|$|On-street parking {{has been}} {{considered}} problematic by engineers for many years. In fact, numerous studies have concluded that diagonal or angle parking in particular is potentially more of a safety concern than parallel or no parking at all. It is a common position of many states, including Iowa, to discourage or completely prohibit angle parking on primary road extensions in urban areas. However, with the acceptance of “context sensitive design” and traffic calming techniques, policies for on-street parking are receiving re -consideration in many agencies including the FHWA. This study was undertaken to analyze operational and safety histories {{in the state of}} Iowa where various types of on-street parking have existed for many years, concentrating in particular on smaller communities. Specifically of interest was a comparison of <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> locations to other types with regard to related crash histories. If possible, it was intended to develop guidelines to assist Iowa Department of Transportation designers in the consideration of parking requirements for road improvements through small communities. In this regard, several criteria were analyzed to determine possible contribution to crash history including road width, clearance to parked vehicles, traffic volumes, community population, and length of parking area. None of these factors, {{with the possible exception of}} population, displayed a clearly definable relationship to crash history. However, when average crash rates for various parking types were compared for non-intersection crashes, differences in rates between areas with <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> and those with parallel parking were almost negligible. In fact, those observed rates were less than sample locations with no parking at all. These results seem to indicate that indeed there may exist no compelling justification for blanket prohibition of angle parking along Iowa’s primary extensions in all urban areas. Rather, a case-by-case investigation with each project design of the most applicable parking type would seem appropriate in smaller communities...|$|E
40|$|El pdf del artículo es la presentacion del Congreso "Soft Computing, HI (2005) ". This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a fuzzy control system for a car-like autonomous vehicle. The problem addressed is the <b>diagonal</b> <b>parking</b> in a constrained space, a typical problem in motion control of nonholonomic robots. The architecture proposed for the fuzzy controller is a hierarchical scheme which combines seven modules working in series and in parallel. The rules of each module employ the adequate fuzzy operators for its task (making a decision or generating a smoothly varying control output), {{and they have been}} obtained from heuristic knowledge and numerical data (with geometric information) depending on the module requirements (some of them are constrained to provide paths of near-minimal lengths). The computer-aided design tools of the environment Xfuzzy 3. 0 (developed by some of the authors) have been employed to automate the different design stages: 1) translation of heuristic knowledge into fuzzy rules; 2) extraction of fuzzy rules from numerical data and their tuning to give paths of near-minimal lengths; 3) offline verification of the control system behavior; and 4) its synthesis to be implemented in a true robot and be verified on line. Real experiments with the autonomous vehicle ROMEO 4 R (designed and built at the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, University of Seville, Seville, Spain) demonstrate the efficiency of the described controller and of the methodology followed in its design.
