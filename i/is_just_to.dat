5|$|Aristarchus {{is located}} on an {{elevated}} rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus Plateau, {{in the midst of}} the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E

5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|The river then {{runs along}} the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest {{impoundment}} on the Saw Mill River, used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the south. The river runs close to {{the boundary between the}} two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast just past the Ashford Avenue bridge.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{has three}} marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into the Bronx {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the west of the Rose Hill campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> {{the north of the}} river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E
5|$|The New Junction Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal {{leave the}} end of the River Don Navigation, and both head broadly north east, but whereas the New Junction Canal {{continues}} in a straight line for its entire length, the Stainforth and Keadby gradually turns to the east. Shortly after the junction, Bramwith Lock lowers the level of the canal. The River Don, after flowing under the New Junction Canal, joins the canal and continues close to the north bank for several miles. Bramwith Swing Bridge is the first of several swing bridges, most of which are operated by boaters. The tiny village of Kirk Bramwith <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the north of the canal and river. Its notable buildings include the church of St Mary, much of which dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a twelfth-century southern doorway. The building is a grade II* listed structure. The hamlet of South Bramwith lies to the south, with Bramwith Hall, a grade II listed 3-storey, 5-bay eighteenth-century country house, which was rebuilt in the early nineteenth century, situated close to the canal. The canal passes to the north of Stainforth, where there is a fixed bridge. A basin, with its former connection to the Don, is now used as moorings by Thorne Cruising Club. This first section is now generally considered {{to be part of the}} Stainforth and Keadby Canal, although it was originally part of the Don Navigation as far as Stainforth Lock.|$|E

At least one aircraft, an American P-47 Thunderbolt ended up in the canal, though this was down to an engine failure with the aircraft undershooting the airfield and plunging into the canal. Whilst the pilot avoided serious injury, the aircraft was dragged out of the canal and scrapped.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} causes of myiasis in {{humans and animals}} are the three {{dipteran}} families Oestridea, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae.

If found in humans, the dipteran larvae are usually in their first instar. The only treatment necessary <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> remove the maggots, and the patient heals naturally. Whilst not strictly a myiasis species, the Congo floor maggot feeds on mammal blood, occasionally human.|$|E
