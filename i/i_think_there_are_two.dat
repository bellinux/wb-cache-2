6000|$|While we {{were talking}} I heard the gun fired which {{announced}} {{the arrival of the}} English mail, and stepping {{to the end of the}} garden, saw the steamer lying at anchor outside the bar. Then I went indoors to write a few business letters which, since I had become immersed in the affairs of that unlucky gold mine, had grown to be almost a daily task with me. I had got through several with many groanings, for none were agreeable in their tenor, when Hans poked his head through the window in a silent kind of a way as a big snake might do, and said: [...] "Baas, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> baases out on the road there who are looking for you.

5000|$|Regarding his {{cover of}} this song, Ingram gave an {{explanation}} in the liner notes of This Is It: [...] "I heard this {{song on the}} radio. I think it's a killer song. I thought we could give it another feel and do it justice. A good song is a good song. I'll let other people choose sides between what genre is what genre and who should stay inside which box. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> kinds of music: good and bad.

5000|$|Regarding the album's lyrical and {{thematic}} content, Jason Lytle noted, [...] "I {{think if}} anything, {{some of the}} elements that used to drive {{a lot of my}} favourite Grandaddy songs home, was this whole storytelling aspect. Creating these little worlds and creating sounds and creating lines where you almost have to create your own little image to go with what you're hearing. ... I had this recurring image throughout the album, and I don't know where this came from. It's this recurring image, of some sort of tragedy. It's a woman, stranded, up high, in a blizzard, among the rocks and a guy who is down in the valley who can't do anything about it and its this distress of him knowing he can't do anything about it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> or three songs, where that imagery pops up." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hakuhō {{has been}} criticized for giving his opponents an {{unnecessary}} final shove after the bout was already over (dameoshi). He did this on Day 4 of the March 2016 tournament in his win over Okinoumi and again on Day 8, when he sent Yoshikaze crashing into the ring side judge Izutzu Oyakata, fracturing Izutzu's left femur and putting him out of action for three months. Hakuhō was warned by the head of the judging committee, Isegahama Oyakata, who said, [...] "he has to understand completely that (such) redundant finishing blows are dangerous." [...] Hakuhō apologized, calling his actions [...] "inexcusable... Even I have weaknesses in the ring that I want to correct." [...] Speaking after his tournament victory in May 2016 he commented, [...] "I don’t know why but when I get into the ring, I turn into a different Hakuho. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> Hakuhos. I'm gentler when I'm not in the ring." ...|$|E
40|$|PART II. Subordo: Anisoptera. Fam. Aeschnidae. Subfam. Gomphinae. Genus: Gomphoides Selys. The little {{material}} {{of the interesting}} family of Gomphinae we know from this island, is represented by a few specimens of the genus Gomphoides. In the year 1929 on July 13 and some days afterwards, two specimens, one male and one female of different species were taken by myself on a small river in the mountains near Mt. St. Benedict. Since these captures no Gomphoides was seen again, all the time I stayed in Trinidad. Mr. E. B. WILLIAMSON in Michigan, from whom I got information when determining my Gomphoides-specimens, wrote me in this connection, {{that he was just}} working at a revision of the genus and not able (March 17, 1930) to name my Trinidad specimens. About one year afterwards in a letter dated Jan. 13, 1931, Mr. WILLIAMSON wrote me, that two Gomphoides-specimens were received from Trinidad from the collector Belmontes in Brasso, a male in a consignment for his own collection and a female in a collection consigned to Dr. WALKER in Toronto, which specimen was forwarded to him by Dr. WALKER. In his last letter of April 6, 1932, Mr. WILLIAMSON noted on the Gomphoides-specimens: "As to Trinidad Gomphoides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> species in all the material to date. I have no reason to think the Trinidad Gomphoides represent anything new, so I believe naming of the scanty material can well await the completion of my study if that meets with your approval"...|$|E

40|$|The budget’s {{shortcomings}} don’t {{end with}} the fairness problem THE ABBOTT government’s problems began long before the 2014 – 15 budget, but now the budget {{is at the heart}} of them. It has failed to win support from the voters, and failed to win support from the Senate. Why? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> reasons. The first is that its measures, taken together, fail the test of fairness. That’s well known, and the opinion polls show the public’s reaction. The second is not well known, but it may have been grasped intuitively by many Australians, which is why the government’s appeals to national interest have fallen flat. In short, the sum of the government’s actions is not to reduce the budget deficit, but only to rearrange it. And now, as treasurer Joe Hockey will tell us on 16 December when he releases the heavily revised Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, or MYEFO, the plunge in mineral prices and the economy’s failure, yet again, to meet budget forecasts mean a return to surplus is now just a distant goal, and we will face big deficits all the way to the next election. But even back in May, if you looked at the budget numbers, the net impact of the Abbott government’s policy decisions would have cut the deficit by just $ 4 billion over its first four years in office. Add in a crucial cost the budget numbers left out, add in the extra spending approved since the budget, and the net impact of the government’s decisions has been to increase the budget deficit – not to reduce it… Read the full articl...|$|E
