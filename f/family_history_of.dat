40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{plays an}} important role in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric cancer. Eradication of H. pylori can effectively reduce the risk of gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the expression levels of FHIT, IL- 8 and P 73 in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. One hundred and thirty-two patients with functional dyspepsia having first-degree relatives with gastric cancer were prospectively recruited in this study. Nine patients presented with H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer, 61 with H. pylori infection and without <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer, 6 without H. pylori infection and with <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer, and 56 without H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer. The protein and mRNA expression levels of FHIT, IL- 8 and P 73 in gastric mucosa of the subjects were detected by immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Compared with the patients without H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer, both the protein and mRNA levels of FIHT significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori infection and/or <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL- 8 significantly increased. After eradication of H. pylori, both the protein and mRNA levels of FHIT were significantly higher, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL- 8 were significantly lower. However, H. pylori infection and <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gastric cancer had no major effect on P 73 expression. Down-regulation of FHIT and up-regulation of IL- 8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in the first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients...|$|R

5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth.

5|$|Women with a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{endometrial cancer}} are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer.

The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer.

5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and a <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease.

Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
