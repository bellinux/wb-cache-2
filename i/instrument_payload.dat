The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E
25|$|The spacecraft's manufacturer, Orbital Sciences Corporation, appealed NASA's decision, {{offering}} {{to build the}} spacecraft at cost, forgoing any profit {{in order to gain}} experience in a new market field. NASA then put the cancellation under review, and on March 27, 2006, it was announced that the mission would not be cancelled after all. In the last week of September 2006, the Dawn mission's <b>instrument</b> <b>payload</b> integration reached full functionality. Although originally projected to cost US$373 million, cost overruns inflated the final cost of the mission to US$446 million in 2007. Christopher T.

2500|$|Most of {{the early}} {{concepts}} envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed {{in an era when}} the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific <b>instrument</b> <b>payload.</b> Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively [...] "dirty" [...] vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983 NASA was considering the [...] "possibility of a long duration [...] SIRTF mission".|$|E

5000|$|In 1963 Space Data Corporation (SDC) {{formed to}} provide small {{sounding}} rockets {{to the various}} defence agencies. They used the meteorological rockets and created an <b>instrument</b> <b>payload</b> for the Loki {{in place of the}} chaff dispenser. There were at least three variants of the <b>instrument</b> <b>payload,</b> PWN-10, PWN-11, and PWN-12. [...] The instruments consisted primarily of a thermistor to collect temperature, which was broadcast via a small radio operating in the 1680 MHz Meteorological Band. Altitude was tracked from the ground, by reflecting radar off the probe's [...] "starute", a square mylar parachute and radar reflector, or with the PWN-10 by means of a ranging transponder. The SDC version was slightly heavier than the original Loki in order to improve stability during [...] "cruise", which lowered maximum altitude by about 10,000 ft. Production of the Loki Datasonde started in 1966, and more than 20,000 were built until production ended in 1985.|$|E

40|$|A 40 -foot-nominal-diameter (12. 2 meter) disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA supersonic {{high altitude}} parachute experiment (SHAPE) program. The test parachute (which included an experimental energy absorber in the attachment riser) was deployed from an <b>instrumented</b> <b>payload</b> by means of a deployment mortar when the payload was at a Mach number of 3. 31 and a free-stream dynamic pressure of 10. 6 pounds per square foot (508 newtons per square meter). The parachute deployed properly, the canopy inflating to a full-open condition at 1. 03 seconds after mortar firing. The first full inflation of the canopy was immediately followed by a partial collapse with subsequent oscillations of the frontal area from about 30 to 75 percent of the full-open frontal area. After 1. 07 seconds of operation, a large tear appeared in the cloth near the canopy apex. This tear was followed by two additional tears shortly thereafter. It was later determined that a section of the canopy cloth was severely weakened by the effects of aerodynamic heating. As a result of the damage to the disk area of the canopy, the parachute performance was significantly reduced; however, the parachute remained operationally intact throughout the flight test and the <b>instrumented</b> <b>payload</b> was recovered undamaged...|$|R

50|$|The V-2 would tumble in {{the rare}} {{atmosphere}} at high altitudes. Having been {{designed as a}} weapon, the V-2 carried a large payload, approximately one ton of high explosive. This was more than was considered necessary for the scientific <b>instrument</b> <b>payload</b> of a high-altitude research rocket, {{but in the case}} of the V-2, used for research, most of the payload was lead ballast required for stable flight, limiting the potential speed and altitude that could be reached with the smaller payloads typically needed for early scientific investigations.|$|E
50|$|The LCROSS science <b>instrument</b> <b>payload,</b> {{provided}} by NASA's ARC, {{consisted of a}} total of nine instruments: one visible, two near infrared, and two mid-infrared cameras; one visible and two near-infrared spectrometers; and a photometer. A data handling unit (DHU) collected the information from each instrument for transmission back to LCROSS Mission Control. Because of the schedule and budget constraints, LCROSS took advantage of rugged, commercially available components. The individual instruments went through a rigorous testing cycle that simulated launch and flight conditions, identifying design weaknesses and necessary modifications for use in space, at which point the manufacturers were allowed to modify their designs.|$|E
