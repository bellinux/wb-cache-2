Articles 4 through 10 pertained to the internal organization of the CMSN and presidential succession. Members were nominated to the CMSN by ordinance of that body, and it alone decided the procedures by which it would conduct its business. Included within the CMSN was the Permanent Committee, consisting of all CMSN members posted to Nouakchott.

50|$|The Belgian Constitution {{provides}} that the Federal Parliament meets by {{right on the}} second Tuesday of October every year for a parliamentary session of at least 40 days.

In principle, an ordinary session lasts from the second Tuesday of October until {{the day before the}} second Tuesday of October the following year, however, the Federal Parliament goes into recess three times a year, for the Christmas holidays, the Easter holidays and for the summer holidays from 20 July until the end of September.

5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{government}} exists by {{the order of}} its nomination through {{the president of the}} Republic (article 8), without reference to a possible investiture by the assembly. Article 20 makes clear, by referring to articles 49 and 50, that the president is responsible before the parliament, but the constitution does not attach conditions to any of his powers regarding his [...] "commitment of responsibility", and even when it is required, no deadline is fixed to limit the obligation, which in reality is comes down to a moral decision. The interpretation of the clause as being optional is also that which Michel Debré made in front of the Conseil d'État, even before the adoption of the constitution: [...] "the weapon of {{the government}} and of it alone". But in his first speech of general policy, he said on this topic that [...] "the text does not say explicitly that he must do it, but the spirit of the Constitution is clear." [...] This difficulty with regards to the connotation of the indicative mood is not the only semantic issue affecting the Constitution; one could bring up the debate of 1960 about article 29, [...] "Parliament shall convene <b>in</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>session,</b> {{at the request of the}} prime minister or of the majority of the members of the National Assembly, to consider a specific agenda."

5000|$|Only one {{sabotage}} {{mission is}} known to have been launched in England. Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named James Aitken, recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the Royal Navy Dockyards in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique incendiary device of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: [...] "We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for." [...] In late November 1776, Aitken landed at Dover, and on December 7 he ignited a fire at the Portsmouth dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of hemp, ten one-hundred-fathom (183 m) cables, and six tons of ship cordage. After failing to penetrate the security at Plymouth, Aitken proceeded to Bristol, where he destroyed two warehouses and several houses. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious [...] "John the Painter" [...] (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again <b>in</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>session,</b> discussed suspending habeas corpus and placing the country under martial law. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and inflammables in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when interrogated, but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the gallows at Portsmouth Dockyard, where his exploits had begun.|$|E
