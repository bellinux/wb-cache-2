500|$|The {{character}} Li'l Sebastian, {{a miniature}} horse beloved by {{the residents of}} Pawnee, was first introduced in [...] "Harvest Festival", which was also written by Goor. The writers considered having a human character die in [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] rather than the miniature horse, like previously-mentioned characters Mayor Gunderson or Councilman Bill Dexhart. However, they decided that having an animal character die felt less morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series. ... Every time <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> in the edit bay, I have this weird crisis: 'Is this OK that this scene is how we're ending this entire season?' It's truly nuts. It's like a hallucinogenic nightmare." ...|$|E
500|$|Platten {{dedicated}} {{the visual}} to her music teacher in elementary school, Anne Scigliano. The singer spoke about Scigliano: [...] " [...] {{gave me my}} first starring role in a play, and inspired me, and made me love the stage." [...] The singer also commented regarding the filming shoot, [...] "The entire day was such a love fest, casting actual fans {{to participate in this}} shoot really brought the concept to life. Surprising and singing along with them was just the icing on the cake. Every time <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> I still get the feels!" [...] The video for [...] "Better Place" [...] premiered on her Vevo account on May 9, 2016. It was released as a paid download in the United States on the following day. Emilee Linder from Fuse reacted positively to it, finding it to be inspiring and full of [...] "syrupy goodness".|$|E
500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E

500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative. This {{is just a}} bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies <b>I</b> <b>watch.</b> <b>It</b> pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film {{takes a long time to}} [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
