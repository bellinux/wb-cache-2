5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote more}} time to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased <b>his</b> <b>level</b> of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Del Potro {{defeated}} Henri Laaksonen, Adrián Menéndez-Maceiras and Roberto Bautista Agut {{in straight}} sets, putting his best year performance to date against Bautista Agut. He began his fourth round match against Dominic Thiem greatly struggling, falling 1-6, 2-6 behind. However, he then raised <b>his</b> <b>level</b> and, {{with the help}} of the crowd, he eventually prevailed in five sets, including saving two match points in the fourth set with two aces. In the post match interview he admitted he considered retiring from the match during the second set.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep <b>his</b> <b>level</b> up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. <b>His</b> <b>level</b> of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium <b>his</b> <b>level</b> of {{collaboration}} with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme {{for nearly a decade}} on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.|$|E
5|$|Going into Wimbledon, Murray had {{not lost}} a match on grass since the {{previous}} year's final, {{and was on}} a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker and Yen-hsun Lu respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed Tommy Robredo, and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets {{to set up a}} clash with Mikhail Youzhny, the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the 2012 US Open. For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five, setting up a semifinal clash with 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz, the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up <b>his</b> <b>level</b> of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.|$|E
50|$|On June 28, 2011, Nate {{appeared}} on MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani {{and stated that}} in August 2010 he felt tired and moody and his doctor discovered he had low testosterone levels. That doctor put Nate on hormone replacement therapy, and when Nate applied for a Therapeutic Use Exemption with the New Jersey state commission, they allowed it but declared that he must go off the therapy for ten weeks, then have <b>his</b> <b>levels</b> retested by a specialist to determine if he {{really needs to be}} on the therapy or not. At the end of that period, both the specialist and Nate's primary doctor agreed <b>his</b> <b>levels</b> really were low and he was a candidate for replacement therapy. Nate's primary doctor injected him with testosterone to quickly get <b>his</b> <b>levels</b> back up in time for his scheduled fight against Story. The Pennsylvania commission had set standards for what <b>his</b> testosterone <b>levels</b> could be at fight time and Nate's levels, though trending down over the last week before the fight, still failed to fall to within the range required in time for him to be cleared to fight. Nate claimed that he retook tests {{on the day of the}} fight and was actually within qualifying limits, thus having his suspension lifted by the commission.|$|R
