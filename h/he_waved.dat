5|$|Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably {{entered the}} 1987 NBA Playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> his right hand over his own head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{thorough}} search, the revolutionaries discovered only seven prisoners in the Bastille, rather fewer {{than had been}} anticipated. Of these, only one – de Whyte de Malleville, an elderly and white-bearded man – closely resembled the public image of a Bastille prisoner; despite being mentally ill, he was paraded through the streets, where <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> happily to the crowds. Of the remaining six liberated prisoners, four were convicted forgers who quickly vanished into the Paris streets; one was the Count de Solages, who had been imprisoned on the request of his family for sexual misdemeanours; the sixth was a man called Tavernier, who also proved to be mentally ill and, along with Whyte, was in due course reincarcerated in the Charenton asylum.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E

5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E

He then took the bone and waved it the other way, reviving the dead mountain goats and bringing them back to life.|$|E

25|$|A month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser {{entered the}} 1994 race with Arizona Motorsports, hoping {{to qualify for}} what would be his 28th Indy 500. The team was very underfunded, and Unser had {{considerable}} trouble getting the car up to speed. On the first weekend of qualifying, <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> off after a poor qualifying lap. After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2008, during game {{three of}} a first round playoff game against the New Jersey Devils, Avery {{turned his back on}} the play in order to face and screen Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur during a two-man {{advantage}} on the power play. <b>He</b> <b>waved</b> his hands and stick in front of Brodeur in an attempt to distract him and block his view. The puck was later cleared out of the Devils' zone but on the second Rangers offensive attack, Avery scored a power play goal.|$|E
25|$|Governor Dukakis {{attempted}} to quell criticism {{that he was}} ignorant on military matters by staging a photo op in which he rode in an M1 Abrams tank outside a General Dynamics plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The move ended up being regarded as a major public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> to the crowd from the tank. Footage of Dukakis {{was used by the}} Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and the incident remains a commonly cited example of backfired public relations outings.|$|E

25|$|On August 26, 2011, Fredette {{announced}} his engagement to BYU cheerleader Whitney Wonnacott on Twitter. They were married on June 1, 2012, in the Denver LDS Temple. He {{missed the first}} playoff game in the CBA playoffs of 2017 because he traveled home to Denver, Colorado, {{to be with his}} wife during the birth of their first child. Upon his return he scored 39 points in overtime to give his team the win. While exiting the court <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> to the camera and told his wife and child he was bringing them home a championship.|$|E
25|$|Lee's men {{advanced}} {{with the}} five regiments in line abreast. The 3rd and 5th Virginia Cavalry regiments, led by sharpshooters, ran along the stone fence with the expectation they would find a gap in it somewhere. Pelham moved forward with Lee's men, and as <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> them through a gate in the fence, a shell exploded over his head, sending a tiny fragment into his brain, mortally wounding him. He died a few hours later. The Confederate advance was repulsed by carbine fire from the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry and shelling from Martin's battery.|$|E

They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed. The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.|$|E

Suddenly six Japanese, led by two officers wielding swords, rushed out and Naik Fazal Din was run through the chest by one of them. As the sword was withdrawn, the naik wrested it {{from the hands of}} its owner and killed him with it. Having killed another Japanese with the sword <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> it aloft, continuing to encourage his men before staggering back to make his report and collapsing.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rudd won {{his only}} {{race of the}} year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of {{controversy}} {{in one of the most}} bizarre finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd drove up to second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> to his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.|$|E
500|$|However, McClellan soon {{received}} a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>waved</b> the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home."

500|$|The most {{controversial}} {{decision of the}} match came in the 73rd minute as {{it led to the}} opening goal. Touré's clearance presented United the chance to break in numbers and Rooney, at the heart of their attack, reached the penalty area only to go down under Campbell's challenge. Riley awarded United a penalty, despite Campbell seeming to withdraw from the tackle and Rooney [...] "...already heading for the turf as the defender pulled his foot away," [...] wrote Kevin McCarra in his match report for The Guardian. Van Nistelrooy converted his penalty kick, sending Lehmann the wrong way to give United the lead. Arsenal responded hastily, but looked more susceptible to United's counter-attacks. Cole's sliding tackle on Cristiano Ronaldo near the penalty area was deemed acceptable by Riley, as <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> away appeals for another penalty. The defender came close to equalising minutes before the end, but for his shot to go wide. In stoppage time, United added their second goal of the match as substitutes Louis Saha and Alan Smith combined to set up Rooney, who finished a counter-attacking move with a tap-in past Lehmann.|$|E
500|$|On 27 October 1659 three QuakersMarmaduke Stevenson, William Robinson and Mary Dyerwere {{led to the}} Boston gallows {{from the}} prison {{where they had been}} {{recently}} held for their Quaker evangelism, against which Massachusetts had enacted very strict laws. [...] Wilson, now nearly 70, as pastor of the Boston church was on hand as the supervising minister. As the two Quaker men first approached the gallows, wearing hats, Wilson said to Robinson, [...] "Shall such jacks as you come in before authority with your hats on?" [...] Ignoring the barb, Robinson then let forth a barrage of words, to which Wilson angrily responded, [...] "Hold thy tongue, be silent; thou art going to die with a lie in your mouth." [...] The two Quaker men were then hanged, after which it was Dyer's turn to ascend the ladder. [...] As the noose was fastened about her neck, and her face covered, a young man came running and shouting, wielding a document which <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> before the authorities. Governor Endecott had stayed her execution. [...] After the two executions had taken place, Wilson was said to have written a ballad about the event, which was sung by young men around Boston.|$|E
500|$|Tulloch's {{approach}} has undoubtedly resulted in outcomes {{that would not}} have been possible otherwise. In 1991, he presented Edith Brown Haisman, a 96-year-old survivor of the disaster, with her father's pocket watch which had been retrieved from the sea bed. She had last seen it on 15 April 1912 when <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat 14. They never saw him again and he presumably went down with the ship. The watch was loaned to Haisman [...] "for life"; when she died four years later it was reclaimed by RMS Titanic Inc. On another occasion, a steamer trunk spotted in the debris field was found to contain three musical instruments, a deck of playing cards, a diary belonging to one Howard Irwin, and a bundle of letters from his girlfriend Pearl Shuttle. It was first thought that Irwin, a musician and professional gambler, had boarded the ship under a false identity. There was no record of him being among the passengers, even though a ticket had been purchased for him. It turned out that he had stayed ashore but his trunk had been brought aboard the ship by his friend Henry Sutehall, who was among the victims of the disaster. The fragile contents of the trunk were preserved due to the interior being starved of oxygen, which prevented bacteria from consuming the paper. Very few other shipwrecks have yielded readable paper.|$|E
