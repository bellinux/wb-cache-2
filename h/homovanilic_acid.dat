50|$|A 2002 {{study in}} Japan tested {{a drug that}} may be of use in curbing the emetic {{response}} to drugs that increase dopamine concentrations. The study investigated morphine-induced emesis in ferrets, explaining that morphine exposure triggered dopamine release in the medulla oblongata and in the area postrema by activating opiate receptors, which in turn caused vomiting by the ferrets. Yet a pre-treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, a dopaminergic neurotoxin, significantly {{reduced the number of}} emetic episodes in the ferrets following morphine exposure. This neurotoxin reduced levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> a metabolite of dopamine, and is known to destroy noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. Here, 6-hydroxydopamine was injected directly into the medulla oblongata but not {{in other parts of the}} brain. This study shows how the dopaminergic pathway in the medulla oblongata may be manipulated in order to reduce the nauseating side-effects associated with so many dopamine-increasing drugs.|$|E

Thirty anorexics, 18 restricted and 12 bingeing-purging, underwent a 3 -month course of cognitive behavioral therapy, plus at random and double-blinded oral olanzapine (2. 5 mg for 1 month, 5 mg for 2 months) in half and oral placebo in the other half of them. BMI, psychopathological aspects (eating disorder inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale, Buss-Durkee Rating Scale, Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale, temperament-character inventory), and homovanillic acid blood concentrations for dopamine secretion, were monitored at baseline and then monthly during the trial. At the end of the trial BMI, total eating disorder inventory, total Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale, Buss-Durkee Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale scores and in olanzapine-treated patients the subitems of eating disorder inventory ineffectiveness and maturity fear, of Buss-Durkee Rating Scale direct aggressiveness, of temperament-characteristic inventory persistence had improved significantly. When stratified for anorexia nervosa subtype, BMI changes were significant among anorexia nervosa bingeing-purging patient, 'depression' (Hamilton Rating Scale) and 'direct aggressiveness' (Buss-Durkee Rating Scale) among anorexia nervosa bingeing-purging patients, 'persistence' (temprerament-characteristic inventory), among anorexics restricted patients, with a trend toward significance for obsessivity-compulsivity (Yale Brown Cornell for Eating Disorders Rating Scale). <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> blood levels increased significantly in the cognitive behavioral therapy+olanzapine group.

40|$|Correspondence {{should be}} {{addressed}} to S Sjöberg) Monoamine precursors, neurotransmitters and their metabolites were studied in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from nine newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients. Before treatment, the serum TSH correlated positively with the CSF concentrations of tyrosine and phenylalanine. During treatment, the levels of the precursors tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine decreased significantly, as was also the case with dopamine and the noradrenaline metabolite 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylglycol (HMPG), but not with serotonin, noradrenaline and the serotonin metabolite 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid, nor the dopamine metabolites <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid. The study provided some indication that the CSF levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine are related to thyroid function. Furthermore, we have found an indication that L-thyroxine treatment affects the CSF levels of the precursors as well as dopamine and HMPG.

Monoamine {{turnover in}} pentobarbital (PB) anesthetized rats was compared to those in awake rats. In the noradrenergic system, noradrenaline levels after pargyrine treatment in PB rats did not differ from those in awake rats in 7 regions examined, while 3 -methoxy 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol levels after probenecid was higher in PB rats in 5 regions. In the dopaminergic system, L-Dopa levels after NSD 1015 and dopamine (DA) levels after pargyrine in the striatum in PB rats were lower. Higher DA levels after pargyrine in the midbrain and cerebral cortex were accompanied by lower levels of <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) after probenecid, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and HVA/DA. In the serotonergic system, lower 5 -hydroxytryptophan levels after NSD 1015 were observed while higher serotonin levels after pargyrine were found in the hypothalamus, hippocamous and cerebral cortex.

Changes in predator avoidance, foraging and shoaling behaviour {{have been reported in}} sticklebacks infested with S. solidus, but the mechanisms underlying parasite-induced behavioural changes are not understood. Monoamine neurotransmitters are involved in the control of behaviour and central monoaminergic systems are sensitive to various stressors. Thus, the behavioural effects of S. solidus infestation might be a reflection of changes in brain monoaminergic activity in the stickleback host.

40|$|The major {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} neuroleptic {{action of the}} tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) {{appears to be an}} interaction with dopamine receptor mechanisms based on biochemical binding and behavioral experiments. In vivo microdialysis was used in conscious rats to investigate the effects of local perfusion with NT on the sensitivity of striatal dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors for their selective agonists by monitoring extracellular dopamine, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the awake unrestrained male rat. Perfusion with NT (10 nM) counteracted the inhibitory effects of the dopamine D 2 agonist pergolide (500 nM) on extracellular levels of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In contrast, NT (10 mM) significantly enhanced the reduction of extracellular striatal levels of dopamine after perfusion with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 (5 microM), and this combined treatment also resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} extracellular striatal levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid. These results provide in vivo evidence that NT regulates central dopamine transmission by reducing pre-and postsynaptic dopamine D 2 and enhancing D 1 receptor sensitivity possibly through an antagonistic NT receptor-D 2 receptor interaction.

40|$|Ventricular fluid {{concentrations}} of <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) and dopamine (DA) were measured in 20 {{patients with the}} various types of hydrocephalus (seven with congenital hydrocephalus, five with aqueduct obstruction, five with secondary hydrocephalus after subarachnoidal hemorrhage and three with postoperative hydrocephalus of head trauma or a brain tumor. Probenecid loading test was also performed. By estimating changes in HVA, two types of hydrocephalus were differentiated (responder and non-responder). HVA concentrations were high in cases with acute hydrocephalus and responded well to probenecid loading. No response was observed in other types of hydrocephalus. In cases of acute aqueduct obstruction, the preshunting value or HVA was high and did not respond to probenecid loading. This result suggests that there is an active transport system for the acid metabolites, particularly HVA in man, in the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. When compared with the acute stage of hydrocephalus, ventricular dopamine concentrations were lower in the chronic stage of congenital hydrocephalus, and hydrocephalus secondary to a subarachnoidal hemorrhage or brain tumor. These results show that HVA excretion into the cerebrospinal fluid is lower in such hydrocephalic patients and that in some cases, administration of L-DOPA could be reasonably effective in ameliorating clinical pictures...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Amine {{precursor}} uptake and decarboxylation is {{a classical}} feature of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Production of catecholamines was studied in GEP NET and non-NET patients. Design: A cross-sectional study was undertaken. Methods: We studied catecholamine and metabolite secretion in 115 consecutive GEP NET patients and in 20 patients with non-NET. After specific extraction, vanilmandelic acid, <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) and methoxylated derivates (metanephrine, normetanephrine, methoxytyramine) in urinary extracts {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography.

Results: Among the 115 patients with NET, 9 (8 %) had an increase {{of at least one}} urinary catecholamine or metabolite; in 7 out of the 9 the increase was slight being less than twice the upper value of the normal range. Elevated urinary dopamine (3 patients), methoxytyramine (6 patients), norepinephrine (2 patients) and normetanephrine (2 patients) were found. No increased urinary excretion of epinephrine nor metanephrine was observed. An adrenal mass existed in one of these nine patients but metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was negative as was immunohisto-chemistry for epithelial markers.

Recently {{it has been reported}} that in a rat model of AAS abuse stanozolol induces behavioural and biochemical changes related to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. In the present study, we used the model of AAS abuse to examine possible changes in the monoaminergic system, a neurobiological substrate of depression, in different brain areas of stanozolol-treated animals. Wistar rats received repeated injections of stanozolol (5 mg/kg, s. c.), or vehicle (propylene glycol, 1 ml/kg) once daily for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after last injection, changes of dopamine (DA) and relative metabolite levels, <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) and 3, 4 -dihydroxy phenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5 -HT) and its metabolite levels, 5 -hydroxy indolacetic acid (5 -HIAA), and noradrenaline (NA) amount were investigated in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), striatum (STR) and hippocampus (HIPP). The analysis of data showed that after chronic stanozolol, DA levels were increased in the HIPP and decreased in the PFC. No significant changes were observed in the STR or in the NAC. 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA levels were decreased in all brain areas investigated after stanozolol exposure; however, the 5 -HIAA/ 5 -HT ratio was not altered. Taken together, our data indicate that chronic use of stanozolol significantly affects brain monoamines leading to neurochemical modifications possibly involved in depression and stress-related states.

Wistar Hannover rats were submitted to subchronic (3 days) intermittent hypoxia exposure (alternating cycles of 2 min room air- 2 min 10 % O(2) from 0700 - 1900 h) and paradoxical sleep deprivation using the single platform method. Rats were randomly assigned to four different protocols: 1) control, 2) intermittent hypoxia during the light period (12 h/day), 3) paradoxical sleep deprivation (24 h/day), and 4) intermittent hypoxia combined with paradoxical sleep deprivation. Rats subjected to intermittent hypoxia showed no modification in the behavioral or neurochemical parameters assessed. Although paradoxical sleep deprivation did not produce alterations in anxiety-like behavior, the rats did increase exploratory activity in the elevated plus-maze. Moreover, a significant increase in striatal epinephrine and hippocampal <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) concentrations was found in the paradoxical sleep deprivation groups, but not in the intermittent hypoxia/paradoxical sleep deprivation group. of note, both paradoxical sleep deprivation and intermittent hypoxia/paradoxical sleep deprivation groups showed an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration.

Despite the recognized importance of the switch phenomenon, the precise mechanisms underlying this process are yet to be shown. We conducted a naturalistic study in two BDI patients to determine whether biological markers (monoamine metabolites and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) {{are associated with the}} switch between depressive and manic states. Case presentation and methods: Blood sampling and mood assessments were performed at 2 -week intervals over a period of 2 (Case 1, n= 72) and 6 (Case 2, n= 183) years. Plasma concentrations of 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma BDNF was assayed by sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Results: MHPG had the highest standardized coefficient (β) in the multiple regression analysis. We found a significant positive correlation between Young Mania Rating Scale scores and plasma MHPG levels (Case 1 : р= 0. 429; Case 2 : р= 0. 488), and a significant negative correlation between Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores and MHPG levels (Case 1 : р=- 0. 542; Case 2 : р=- 0. 465). Conversely, no significant correlation was found between the level of BDNF and the presence of a manic or depressive state, and although HVA had a slightly stronger correlation than MHPG, the levels of neither of these were found to significantly correlate with the symptoms. Conclusion: These data suggest that peripheral MHPG levels (which is related to noradrenaline levels in the brain) {{could be used as a}} biomarker of mood states in BDI. The noradrenaline level in the brain is likely to reflect the clinical characteristics of the switch process in BDI, and has prognostic significance for the treatment of both manic and depressive states.

40|$|Abstract Background Caffeine, a nonselective {{adenosine}} A 1 and A 2 A receptor antagonist, is {{the most}} widely used psychoactive substance in the world. Evidence demonstrates that caffeine and selective adenosine A 2 A antagonists interact with the neuronal systems involved in drug reinforcement, locomotor sensitization, and therapeutic effect in Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence also indicates that low doses of caffeine and a selective adenosine A 2 A antagonist SCH 58261 elicit locomotor stimulation whereas high doses of these drugs exert locomotor inhibition. Since these behavioral and therapeutic effects are mediated by the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways which project to the striatum, we hypothesize that low doses of caffeine and SCH 58261 may modulate the functions of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. Methods In this study, we evaluated the neuroadaptations in the striatum by using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantitate the concentrations of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, dihydroxylphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA), and using immunoblotting to measure the level of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) at Ser 31, following chronic caffeine and SCH 58261 sensitization in mice. Moreover, to validate further that the behavior sensitization of caffeine is through antagonism at the adenosine A 2 A receptor, we also evaluate whether chronic pretreatment with a selective adenosine A 2 A antagonist SCH 58261 or a selective adenosine A 1 antagonist DPCPX can sensitize the locomotor stimulating effects of caffeine. Results Chronic treatments with low dose caffeine (10 mg/kg) or SCH 58261 (2 mg/kg) increased the concentrations of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, concomitant with increased TH phosphorylation at Ser 31 and consequently enhanced TH activity in the striatal tissues in both caffeine- and SCH 58261 -sensitized mice. In addition, chronic caffeine or SCH 58261 administration induced locomotor sensitization, and locomotor cross-sensitization to caffeine was observed following chronic treatment of mice with SCH 58261 but not with DPCPX. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that low dosages of caffeine and a selective adenosine A 2 A antagonist SCH 58261 elicited locomotor sensitization and cross-sensitization, which were associated with elevated dopamine concentration and TH phosphorylation at Ser 31 in the striatum. Blockade of adenosine A 2 A receptor may {{play an important role in}} the striatal neuroadaptations observed in the caffeine-sensitized and SCH 58261 -sensitized mice. </p...|$|E

The most abundant amines detected in the brain and heart of active H. lucorum were 5 -HT and DA. Of the metabolites examined only 5 -HIAA was found in the brain. NE was found at very low levels but only in the brain, while E was not detected in the brain and heart. The levels of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA increased in the brain and heart of H. lucorum within the first months of hibernation, showing a significant decrease thereafter. The levels of DA did not change during hibernation. The results indicated that 5 -HT might be involved in preparing snails for entry into hibernation. GAGA was only found in the brain of H. lucorum, and the levels were low; these levels remained during hibernation. Adenosine was present in brain and heart of H. lucorum, and during hibernation, the level of adenosine decreased significantly in the brain but remained steady in the heart. The monoamines 5 -HT, DA and NE were present in the brain of active lizards A. stellio stellio, whereas E was found only at very low levels. Moreover, the metabolites 5 -HIAA, DOPAC and HVA were detected in the brain of active lizards. The monoamines 5 -HT, DA, NE and E were also detected in the heart and blood of active lizards. During hibernation the levels of these four monoamines were decreased significantly in the brain and heart of A. stellio stellio. In contrast, the levels of E increased in the heart and blood of hibernating lizards. Adenosine was detected in both heart and brain of active lizards, but hibernation caused a marked decrease in its levels at both tissues. GAGA was found at higher levels than monoamines and adenosine in the brain of active lizards, and hibernation caused a significant increase in its levels, indicating an important role of GAGA in inhibition of neuronal activity in hibernating lizards...|$|E
40|$|Although {{subthalamic nucleus}} deep brain {{stimulation}} (STN-DBS) is effective in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), its physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Because STN-DBS is effective in patients with PD whose motor symptoms are dramatically alleviated by L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment, the higher preoperative catecholamine levels {{might be related to}} the better clinical outcome after surgery. We aimed to examine the correlation between the preoperative catecholamine levels and postoperative clinical outcome after subthalamic nucleus {{deep brain stimulation}}. The effectiveness of STN-DBS in the patient who responded well to dopaminergic medication suggest the causal link between the dopaminergic system and STN-DBS. We also examined how catecholamine levels were modulated after subthalamic stimulation. In total 25 patients with PD were enrolled (Mean age 66. 2 ± 6. 7 years, mean disease duration 11. 6 ± 3. 7 years). Mean levodopa equivalent doses were 1032 ± 34. 6 mg before surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma catecholamine levels were measured an hour after oral administration of antiparkinsonian drugs before surgery. The mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores (UPDRS) and the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire- 39 (PDQ- 39) were obtained before and after surgery. Of the 25 patients, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were collected an hour after oral administration of antiparkinsonian drugs during on stimulation at follow up in 11 patients. Mean levodopa equivalent doses significantly decreased after surgery with improvement in motor functions and quality of life. The preoperative catecholamine levels had basically negative correlations with postoperative motor scores and quality of life, suggesting that higher preoperative catecholamine levels were related to better outcome after STN-DBS. The preoperative plasma levels of L-DOPA had significantly negative correlations with postoperative UPDRS- III score in off phase three months after STN-DBS. The preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) levels had significantly negative correlations with postoperative UPDRS- III score in off phase one year after STN-DBS and the preoperative CSF <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) levels had significant negative correlations with postoperative UPDRS- III score in on phase three months after STN-DBS. In PDQ- 39 SI (summary index), preoperative plasma dopamine (DA) level had significantly negative correlations with postoperative PDQ- 39 SI one year after STN-DBS suggesting that higher preoperative plasma DA level resulted in better quality of life (QOL) one year after STN-DBS. The stepwise multiple linear regression study revealed that higher preoperative plasma HVA levels had negative influence on the postoperative motor symptoms (i. e., increase in the score of UPDRS), whereas higher preoperative CSF L-DOPA levels had positive influence on the postoperative motor symptoms and QOL (decrease in the score of UPDRS and PDQ- 39 SI) The catecholamine levels were not significantly reduced postoperatively in 11 patients despite the significant reduction in levodopa equivalent doses. Unexpectedly, CSF HVA levels significantly increased from 0. 00089 ± 0. 0003 ng/μl to 0. 002 ± 0. 0008 ng/μl after STN-DBS. The preoperative catecholamine levels might affect the postoperative motor symptoms and quality of life. The catecholamine levels were not significantly reduced postoperatively despite the significant reduction in levodopa equivalent doses...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a high}} {{comorbidity}} of type- 2 {{diabetes and}} neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is paucity of preclinical research to study this phenomenon. The validity of the db/db mouse as an animal model to study type- 2 diabetes and related macrovascular and microvascular complications is well established. The {{first part of this}} dissertation was designed to investigate comprehensively the db/db mouse behavior as preclinical evidence of type- 2 diabetes related major neurobehavioral complications. Juvenile (5 - 6 weeks) and adult (10 - 11 weeks) db/db mice were screened for behavioral depression in forced swim test (FST), psychosis-like symptoms using pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) test, anxiety behavior employing elevated plus maze (EPM) test, locomotor behavior and thigmotaxis using open field test, emotional learning using fear potentiation of startle (FPS) test and working memory deficits in Y-maze test. Both juvenile and adult group db/db mice displayed behavioral despair with increased immobility time in FST. There was an age-dependent progression of psychosis-like symptoms with disrupted PPI in adult db/db mice. In the EPM test, db/db mice were less anxious as observed by increased percent open arms time and entries. They were also hypolocomotive as evident by a decrease in their basic and fine movements. There was no impairment of working memory in the Y-maze test in db/db mice. In the FPS test, db/db mice showed impaired learning response indicative of abnormalities in DA neuronal activity in the amygdala. The second specific aim of this dissertation was to examine possible neurochemical basis for the observed behavioral deficits. Monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5 -HT) are elemental to normal functioning of the brain. Current theories of the basis for major neurobehavioral disorders involve abnormalities in use of NE, 5 -HT and DA in specific brain regions. Recent studies report that the DA agonist reverses diabetes-related metabolic abnormalities, thus suggesting that DA abnormalities may provide a link to underlying the psychiatric and endocrine disorders in type- 2 diabetics. To evaluate type- 2 diabetes related neurochemical alterations, concentrations of NE, 5 -HT, DA and its catabolites <b>homovanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were measured in the frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brainstem of db/db mice by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). There was abnormal DA metabolism pattern in the frontal cortex and amygdala of db/db mice that correlated with their psychosis-like behavior and impaired FPS response. Moreover, type- 2 diabetes related changes in the expression of DA biosynthesis rate determining step (RDS) enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were studied using western blot technique. No changes in TH expression pattern were seen in the frontal cortex and amygdala of db/db mice compared to age-matched lean controls. Thus, abnormal DA metabolism pattern in these brain regions of db/db mice may be related to changes in the enzymatic activity of DA metabolizing enzymes and/or firing pattern of DAergic neurons. The third specific aim of this research project was to examine the effect of long-term management of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on neurobehavioral deficits in db/db mice. Rosiglitazone mixed in chow was administered to 5 week old db/db and lean control mice (20 mg/kg/day) for duration of 5 weeks. Separate groups of age-matched db/db and lean control mice were fed with standard chow. Mice were weekly monitored for blood glucose concentration. Five weeks after treatment onset, the mice were subjected to the forced swim test (FST), pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), open field test (OFT) and fear potentiated startle (FPS) test to examine for behavioral depression, psychosis-like behavior, locomotor activity and emotional learning, respectively.
