25|$|Islamic {{architecture}} {{encompasses a}} wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day. Whilst it does have unique characteristics like its geometric and interlace patterned ornaments, it does draw some influence from Persian, Roman, Byzantine Chinese as Indian architectures as Islam was present from the Near East & North Africa to East Asia. The principal Islamic architectural types are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings</b> such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture.|$|E
25|$|Hemyock Castle is {{a ruined}} 14th-century castle, {{in the village}} of Hemyock, Devon, England. It was built by Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe after 1380 to a quadrangular design, around their much older {{existing}} manor house. As a large, lime-washed, moated, stone structure, it would have been visually impressive. By the time of the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, although probably obsolescent militarily, enough still remained for it {{to be used as a}} prison for several hundred captured Royalist soldiers and for it to withstand the first of two Royalist attacks and sieges. Later, much of its defensive walls and towers were pulled down, and the stone re-used <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings.</b> In the 21st century the site has substantial fragments of the original castle and moat. The manor house, originally a Devon hall house, and its outbuildings have been adapted repeatedly over the centuries to suit evolving needs. These are private homes. The site is privately owned but there are regular public open days.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, Northampton vastly changed. In 1959, the M1 {{motorway}} {{was opened}} to the south-west of the town; in 1968, [...] Northampton was designated a New Town. Both these events and the rail link helped Northampton's growth as a commuter town for London. The Northampton Development Corporation (NDC) {{was set up in}} 1968 to substantially redevelop the town in partnership with the local council, spending £205 million to build new housing and industrial estates, initially in Lumbertubs, Moulton Park and Round Spinney to the east, followed by Briar Hill, Camp Hill and East and West Hunsbury in the south of the town, mainly to accommodate the overflow population of new residents from the London area. In the town centre, older buildings were demolished and replaced or redeveloped <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings,</b> including the former Greyfriars bus station, the Grosvenor Centre, Peacock Place (now Market Walk), shops, flats and hotels.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{began on}} the new stamp mill in 1888. The first {{building}} constructed was a boarding house, followed by a dock, cistern, and foundations <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings.</b> [...] In 1889, six substantial frame buildings were constructed on site, {{as well as a}} railway connecting the stamp mill to the mine, and stamping equipment was installed. [...] Mill number one was a wooden structure measuring 198 feet by 120 feet. The pump and boiler house were located {{on the south side of}} the roadway that is now M-26. [...] It was a stone structure measuring 154 feet by 56 feet. [...] An elevated conduit carried water and steam over the road to the mill, and handling facilities were built at the dock. [...] The facility was completed and opened for milling in 1890. The site originally had two stamps; a third was added immediately after opening, and two more were added in 1892.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the {{antiquarian}} John Leland {{reported that the}} castle had fallen into ruin, {{and only a few}} towers remained intact. However, the brevity and vagueness of his report suggests that he did not actually visit the site or examine it in detail. By 1566, apparently the centre of the castle was being used for growing apples. But {{by the time of the}} English Civil War in the mid-17th century, although probably obsolescent militarily, enough still remained for the castle to be used as a prison for several hundred captured Royalist soldiers and for it to withstand the first of two Royalist attacks and sieges. The civil war broke out in England in 1642, between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Lord Poulett, a Royalist, is said to have seized the castle shortly after the outbreak of fighting. During the war the castle was taken by Parliament and used as a prison. In 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne. The castle was [...] "slighted" [...] (largely torn down), and its stone was reused <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings.</b> Late in the 17th century, the stream which had filled the moat was diverted. The eastern part of the moat was filled in to become a farmyard. The large linhay barns were built at this time.|$|E

60|$|It was all {{so sweet}} and restful. Religion had never appealed to her before. The business-like service in the bare cold chapel where she had sat {{swinging}} her feet and yawning as a child had only repelled her. She could recall her father, aloof and awe-inspiring in his Sunday black, passing round the bag. Her mother, always veiled, sitting beside her, a thin, tall woman with passionate eyes and ever restless hands; the women mostly overdressed, and the sleek, prosperous men trying to look meek. At school and at Girton, chapel, which she had attended no oftener than she was obliged, had had about it the same atmosphere of chill compulsion. But here was poetry. She wondered if, after all, religion might not have {{its place in the}} world--in company with the other arts. It would be a pity for it to die out. There seemed nothing to take its place. All these lovely cathedrals, these dear little old churches, that for centuries had been the focus of men's thoughts and aspirations. The harbour lights, illumining the troubled waters of their lives. What could be done with them? They could hardly be maintained out of the public funds as mere mementoes of the past. Besides, there were too many of them. The tax-payer would naturally grumble. As Town Halls, Assembly Rooms? The idea was unthinkable. It would be like a performance of Barnum's Circus in the Coliseum at Rome. Yes, they would disappear. Though not, she was glad to think, in her time. In towns, the space would be required <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>buildings.</b> Here and there some gradually decaying specimen would be allowed to survive, taking its place with the feudal castles and walled cities of the Continent: the joy of the American tourist, the text-book of the antiquary. A pity! Yes, but then from the aesthetic point of view it was a pity that the groves of ancient Greece had ever been cut down and replanted with currant bushes, their altars scattered; that the stones of the temples of Isis should have come to be the shelter of the fisher of the Nile; and the corn wave in the wind above the buried shrines of Mexico. All these dead truths that from time to time had encumbered the living world. Each in its turn had had to be cleared away.|$|E
