5|$|Ben Quick is on trial, {{suspected}} of barn-burning, but when no solid evidence is found, the judge expels him <b>from</b> <b>town.</b> Ben hitches {{a ride to}} Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, with two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula (Lee Remick). Clara's father, Will Varner, is the domineering owner {{of most of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford {{process was}} {{developed}} at the North-Western Gas Board's laboratories in Stretford, during the 1940s. It was the first liquid phase, oxidation process for removing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) <b>from</b> <b>town</b> gas to gain widespread commercial acceptance. Many Stretford plants were built worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan {{what his}} {{intentions}} are, {{and does not}} like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot {{go through with it}} and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between father and son. Men <b>from</b> <b>town</b> assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Will claims he accidentally started the fire by dropping his cigar.|$|E

5|$|During summer 1942, more {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks to replace those moved away <b>from</b> <b>town.</b> Fairbanks residents were drafted {{to work at}} Ladd Field because the U.S. Army believed Alaskans were best experienced in cold-weather work. After gold mining was suspended during the war, the Army leased FE Co. offices and requisitioned supplies from Fairbanks businesses. Wartime demand and the draft caused a severe labor shortage in Fairbanks, and supplies of various food and commercial products were interrupted beyond the wartime rationing {{in the rest of}} the country. Crime also increased, and because the U.S. Army was placed in wartime control of the Alaska Territory, all newspapers and letters to and from Fairbanks were censored.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince {{left the}} company in 1937. He was {{commissioned}} by Harper's Bazaar for {{an article on the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to use him in further issues, and he also took commissions <b>from</b> <b>Town</b> and Country to supplement his income. Vogue invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate work for him. He chose to work for Life magazine, starting with a piece called The Tugboat. Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. Life refused to publish the unauthorized photographs. Kertész resented the constraints on his curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen was an {{important}} stop on the coach route from Launceston to Deloraine from at least the 1840s. The coach service declined from when rail transport started in Tasmania in the late 1860s. The State Government began operating a school bus <b>from</b> <b>town,</b> to Hagley, in the 1930s. Meander Valley Highway, formerly known as Bass Highway, passes through {{the edge of the}} town bypassing the old main street. Bass Highway, which connects Launceston, Burnie and Devonport, branches off from this east of the town at Travellers Rest and passes south of Hadspen.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English {{to primary}} school {{children}} in Griffith, {{as well as}} singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and {{he was promoted to}} the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling <b>from</b> <b>town</b> to town, playing in one-off cricket matches {{at the expense of the}} host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling <b>from</b> <b>town</b> to town by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, {{and to get a}} better view, the two would sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare. They pursued Béla IV <b>from</b> <b>town</b> to town in Dalmatia. The Croatian nobility and Dalmatian towns such as Trogir and Rab helped Béla IV to escape. After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{crossed the}} frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol {{detachment}} {{under the command}} of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla <b>from</b> <b>town</b> to town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan's death. Batu Khan wanted to attend at the election of Ögödei's successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who was grateful to Trogir, granted it lands near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.|$|E

5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away <b>from</b> <b>town.</b> Time then corrects.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards <b>from</b> <b>town</b> along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|F-41 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US23 {{on the north}} side of Oscoda. The route travels to the northwest away <b>from</b> <b>town,</b> passing between Van Etten Lake and what was previously Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The road continues north through a rural area of Alcona County on Somers and Mikado roads, running parallel, but inland, to the Lake Huron shoreline. It passes through the small communities of Mikado and Gustin before coming to a junction with M-72. After crossing M-72, F-41 turns east into the community of Lincoln along Traverse Bay State Road, 2nd Street and Main Street before leaving town to the north. The road continues on to the north on Barlow Road through Alcona County before terminating at a second junction with US23. The highway travels through wooded terrain along its routing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles <b>from</b> <b>town,</b> Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E
5|$|John Hinton, {{known as}} Jack, {{was born in}} Colac Bay in Southland, New Zealand, on 17 September 1909, one of seven {{children}} of Harry Hinton, a railway man, and Elizabeth Mary. He was educated at local schools and on most days, before starting lessons, would milk a herd of 40 cows. When he was 12, he {{ran away from home}} after an argument with his father. He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian whaling ship, which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as a shepherd. He soon tired of this and began the life of a swagman, working <b>from</b> <b>town</b> to town as he travelled around the South Island.|$|E

One afternoon, the mother sits the child near the lake, then leaves her to go meet the Master and Mistress, who are returning <b>from</b> <b>town.</b> Lad saves the baby from a copperhead snake, but the distraught mother only sees Lad throw her backwards and begins beating him. To protect her friend, Baby manages to shakily walk to her mother and explain what happened.
