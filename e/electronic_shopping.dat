40|$|A {{fundamental}} dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone {{sites on}} the World Wide Web and those attempting to build electronic malls for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers ' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> services. Ceteris paribus, if <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just {{as is the case}} for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997) ...|$|E
