50|$|Pleased {{with the}} {{performance}} of the Vickers 1934 artillery truck, the Belgian Army started to equip the newly ordered 32 vehicles with the FRC Herstal built 47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun. Since this was a fairly heavy piece of equipment, and because of the <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of the Vickers artillery tractor, with its center of gravity being well halfway the vehicle, the decision was taken to simply install the gun and its turret backwards on the vehicle, so as to keep enough space for crew and ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of MIDAN City is a fluid {{interconnection}} {{of natural}} site features bordered by the seashore to the North, and by oak and pine forested hills to the South. The overall {{structure of the}} city is articulated on a central business leisure district, flanked to the East and West by two predominantly residential districts. The development of the CBD and the East districts of approximately 1.8 billion square meters are placed under the responsibility of MIDAN City Development Corporation (MCDC) and the West, with area of approximately 0.8 million square meters, by a governmental agency called Incheon Urban Development Corporation (IUDC). With basis on the concept of “All-in-One City” where people can enjoy their utmost life in eco-friendly circumstances provided by diverse features and facilities in relation to entertainment, shopping, leisure, business, medical, educational and residential amenities, it is expected to accommodate and cater for numerous residents and visitors from both overseas and locals in South Korea ...|$|E
40|$|During {{more than}} five years a close {{collaboration}} between CERN and CEA-Saclay led to the development and construction of two prototype quadrupole magnets and the integration of one of them into the short straight section of the LHC half-cell test string at CERN. In the frame of the special host country contribution to the LHC project this collaboration has been extended to the CNRS laboratory in Orsay and covers besides the quadrupole magnets the complete cold mass assembly (CEA) and the integration into the short straight section cryostat (CNRS). The short straight sections include not only the main lattice quadrupoles with their protection diodes, they also house different corrector magnets and the beam position monitors. Further, they provide the cryogenic feed units for a half-cell with all the magnet interconnections and the jumper connection to the separate cryo-line. The paper will show the <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of these complex units and elaborate the different aspects of their assembly...|$|E
40|$|PERSONA is {{an acronym}} for PERsonal and SOcial NAvigation. The name of the project {{illustrates}} its two-fold approach; studying the individual cognitive, social and cultural differences in navigational ability and recognizing that computer users are social beings in interacting with other people as {{they make their way}} through information spaces. Based on this understanding we are developing new approaches to interactive system design. One of these is to identify how and where we can adapt to the individual person's needs. At the same time we are developing alternative approaches to system design, breaking away from the lonely 'walker in the woods' picture of the information system user, to a social being able to interact with other users and so get help in achieving their goals. In this first deliverable from the project, we present a comprehensive review of literature which we see as having an impact on navigation in information space. This volume contains a number of individual and co-authored papers covering various aspects of geographic and electronic spaces and on navigation in geographic and electronic spaces; Individual and cultural differences; Social aspects of navigation; Design based on alternative or complimentary approaches that we believe hold the promise of making interfaces and systems more navigable. This document is a slightly revised version of Deliverable 1. 1. 1 of the PERSONA project, submitted to the European Commission in February 1998. Only typographic errors have been corrected, leading to some changes in the lay-out of the individual pages. The contents and the <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of the individual chapters, including their length are, however, the same as in the original document...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} study of a special electric traction wheel-set for a micro-car for disabled customers. In our university department some solutions on the topic had already been developed in the past. The design has not been carried out in a sequential way, {{but it has been}} lead in “concurrent-engineering” style and it has been speeded up thanks to the employment of solid modelling. The 3 D design technology has helped in a very efficient way {{to take into account the}} impact of any modification on any component to the neighbouring items. The following topics have been considered: design for disabled customers, maximum ease of use and low cost technology. This job therefore has coped the main problems related to designing a new car. Some innovative solutions have been proposed and an overall design procedure has been experienced. This paper in particular describes the results of a research activity connected with the study of the <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of such a wheel set. Some different configurations were explored, each showing its strong and weak points. It is to point out that, while the traditional arrangements connected with gasoline or diesel engines were hugely studied, with the electric traction all the wheel sets must be reshaped. In fact too many car designers tend to use the same lay-out used before, wasting much of the potential advantages offered by electric motors. During this study some radically new designs were explored, for example not using any live axle for transmission or trying to use thrust ball bearing for steering axles. In the following a gallery of proposed and studied solutions will be exposed, showing the most characteristic points. We developed the study and design phases starting from some specifications: the group must be composed by electric motor (geared or not), brake, wheel hub, front or rear traction, in case of front traction the group must have steering pivots (attachments for steering rods). This apparatus has been designed to be used in a light car (which is under development in our faculty). However the proposed design may fit even standard city cars. Design goals were: 1) Keeping very low steering radius (intended use in city environment) 2) Absence of traditional suspension system (our light car has some innovative design in this) 3) Respect of Ackermann geometry. Some different design solution have been developed and are exposed in the paper. The most relevant feature is that every wheel has its own motor, so achieving a dramatic reduction in encumbrance...|$|E
40|$|LHCb is the Large Hadron Collider {{experiment}} to precise measurements of CP violation and rare decays in the B meson sector. It is presently under construction at CERN, {{and it will}} start operations in 2007. In the Standard Model picture, CP violation naturally arises by the complex phase in the unitary 3 x 3 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix which accounts for the quark mixing. Thanks both to the high bb cross section and to the high luminosity, the LHC collider will be {{by far the most}} copious source of B mesons. A large amount of data will be available and the consistency of the Standard Model will be definitively tested by measuring in several ways all the angles and all the sides of the Unitarity Triangle. These measurements will over-constrain the model and look for inconsistencies due to New Physics. The design of the detector has been optimized to match the kinematical structure of bb events produced in a proton-proton collision. One of the key aspects of LHCb is the identification of the particles produced in b-hadron decays. This tool is used to enhance the signal to background ratio in the selection channels and to provide an efficient kaon tag; it will be achieved using Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors. In particular, LHCb will use two RICH detectors, one covering the charged particle momentum range 1 - 65 GeV/c using both solid silica aerogel and gaseous C 4 F 10 radiators, and the other covering up to 100 GeV/c using gaseous CF 4. Pixel Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPDs) have been developed to detect Cherenkov light in the wavelength range 200 - 600 nm. The thesis is structured into six chapters: - 1) is a general introduction to the "CP violation" problem and to the "Beauty Physics". The experimental status of the CKM matrix will be given; - 2) describes the Large Hadron Collider machine and the <b>general</b> <b>lay-out</b> of the LHCb experiment; - 3) is devoted to RICH detectors. Some basic operating principles are given and the experimental challenges together with the factors limiting the particle identification power are discussed. In {{the second part of the}} chapter, the design and the performances of the LHCb RICH detectors will be presented; - 4) introduces solid silica aerogel. This chapter describes the characterization of the optical properties of silica aerogel and all the tests performed during the R&D activity. Results of these tests are discussed; - 5) shows a possible approach to extract the unmeasured oscillation frequency Δ m_s from fully reconstructed B 0 s->Dspi events. The measurement of this parameter is part of the wide physics program of the LHCb collaboration. In the Standard Model picture, the value of Δ m_s is expected to be 20 ps^- 1, and its measurement is quite challenging. Deviation from the expected value would suggest New Physics beyond the Standard Model; - 6) presents the Level- 0 Muon Trigger. A fast and efficient trigger system is required by the detector to reduce the large amounts of uninteresting processes, such as minimum bias events. Muons with high transverse momentum p_T will be used by the trigger system. An introduction to the stand-alone application currently used to optimize and to test the performances of the Level- 0 Muon Trigger will be given...|$|E
