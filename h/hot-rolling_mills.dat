40|$|Common to most industries, {{the metal}} {{industry}} {{is having to}} 'rethink' its {{short and long term}} strategies when it comes to producing metals to customers' specifications. Indeed, metal producers are having to balance the requirements for more consistent and higher quality rolled products with those that are associated with greater efficiencies in energy costs and impact on environment. In the light of these considerations, the performance of key industrial systems such as <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mills</b> must be carefully analysed in search of further improvements. Criteria for optimising hot-rolling of steel include system efficacy, advanced control strategies, optimal rolling schedule and product quality. This paper {{is the result of the}} authors' extensive study on the use of advanced technologies and new integrated approaches in the field of optimal scheduling for the hot-rolling process. The proposed design is based on 1. a multiobjective optimisation-based Population Adaptive Immune Algorithm (PAIA); 2. physically-based models and Symbiotic data-driven modelling for the accurate prediction of mechanical properties of alloy steels; 3. advanced control, including Adaptive Fuzzy Generalised Predictive Control (AFGPC) to guarantee the optimal performance of the mill during the rolling process.

40|$|The {{demand for}} "maintenance of {{industrial}} cores" established {{in connection with}} German reunification creates considerable difficulties especially in monostructure regions. That is why the privatisation of the ironworks "Eisenhüttenkombinat Ost" (German abbr. EKO) in Brandenburg {{turned out to be}} one of the most difficult cases of privatisation after reunification. It took more than four years until finally at the beginning of 1995, the Belgium steel concern Cokkerill-Sambre took over the former nationally owned model combine from the trust agency "Treuhand" (at first 60 % of the shares, the remaining 40 % not later than 1999). The privatisation process and the future development of the plant location were especially complicated by three aspects in the transition of the steel region from the planned economy to the market economy: At first, the formely favourable geographic situation towards the former trading partners of the Council of Mutual Economic Aid became a doubly peripheral location, namely both with respect to the new Federal Republic and to the common market of the European Union. Although the region has a monostructural orientation towards iron and steel production, it lags technologically far behind the West-German level. There is especially a lack of a <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill</b> which is needed in order to become an integrated, competitive location. The construction of a <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill</b> had to be twice stopped by the GDR for financial reasons. Overemployment and low productivity forced mass redundancies to be carried out after reunification and their consequences have not yet been overcome in the region. That is why privatisation and the beginning of renovation by the trust agency "Treuhand" have been difficult. These measures considerably changed the structure of the whole economic region and concentrated on the following four sectors: the regional and organisatory decentralisation of the combine structure, the reduction of labour force, the beginning of renovation measures in the EKO plant as well as the search for purchasers. Due to the great number and variety of interests of the different parties both on the local and the international level, an investor was only found in 1994. The Belgium concern Cockerill-Sambre developed a concept which in contrast to the other offers preserves relatively many working places (2300 from 12 346 in the past). Above all, the Belgium concern will close the "technological gap" by means of the construction of a <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and thus make the steel location of Eisenhüttenstadt internationally competitive. For this purpose, the steel plant "EKOStahl" will be given additional grants of more than one thousand million marks and will be the second most expensive privatisation project of the reunification. It is true that the direction has been decisively set, but nevertheless the plant and the region will continue to face considerable problems which, in the medium term, will be decisive in the economic development of the region; this is due to the fact that the grants are bound to a limitation in production up to the year 2000. Although the technological gap has been closed by means of the new rolling mill, innovations in steel production might quickly eliminate the advance obtained. Also owing to the steel industry's general susceptibility to crises it is necessary for the region of Eisenhüttenstadt to diversify into the settlement of other industrial and commercial enterprises. For this purpose however, the region especially needs the extension of its insufficient communications infrastructure. This is true both for the inland waterways (river of Oder, Oder-Spree-canal) as well as for the railway tracks and the fast nationwide road communications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that a modern trend in {{development}} of wide-strip <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill</b> technologies is gauge diversification owing to production of thin strip. Engineers are mastering methods of rolling 0. 8 − 1. 5 mm strip that was earlier manufactured at cold rolling mills only. Tension in inter-stand gaps of the continuous train is found to influence thin strip gauge greatly. Based on {{the example of the}} 2, 500 mm mill at OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, it has been proven that existing tension and loop size indirect control systems (TLSCSs) does not meet increasingly stringent requirements for accuracy of tension control. Here, improvement of control algorithms does not result in a significant quality rise. Thus, capabilities of the high-speed system for automated gauge control based on the Hydraulic Gap Control (HGC) may be useful. The improved TLSCS has been developed that enables control of the roll speed and HGC location of the previous stand. The system provides improvement of dynamic data due to compensation {{of the impact of the}} loop gear location of tension. Mathematical modeling has proven that the system developed ensures control of specific tension to a tolerance of ± 10 %. A dynamic component of the strip gauge deviation is within 3 %. The TLSCS developed is recommended for implementation at 2, 500 mm mill of OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works within the framework of the current reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{mechanism}} for the optimal scheduling and {{the control of the}} hot-rolling of steel is presented in this work. Such a mechanism provides optimal rolling parameters to set-up an experimental laboratory-scale <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and thus produce metals with desired microstructural and mechanical characteristics. The proposed methodology combines physically-based models and those associated with 'intelligence' such as Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Genetic Algorithms, to systematically calculate the optimal rolling schedule so as to achieve a right-first-time production of steel alloys, a challenge for academia in general. Unlike current design methods, the scheduling problem is here treated as an optimisation problem which aims at satisfying multiple process objectives and a set of user-defined requirements. Such objectives are expressed in terms of the quantitative elements of the steel microstructure and its mechanical properties' such as strength and toughness. Three main aspects are considered to define and approach the optimisation problem: (1) THE PROCESS 110 DEL, which includes integrated knowledge of the stock microstructure, the mechanical properties, and the processing route; (2) THE PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS associated with the metal due to its chemical composition, as well as the mill operating limitations; and (3) a set of OPTI 11 ALITY CRITERIA which is used as a performance index to evaluate the quality and feasibility of each solution. In order to show the efficacy of this methodology, extensive experimental studies, metallographic analyses, and laboratory mechanical tests, are presented using the commercial type C-l'dn Steel alloy (Bright Mild Steel) grade 080 A 15. The results from such experimental studies showed that the final product was in good agreement with the desired design in terms of the microstructure and the mechanical properties. The experiment results also demonstrated the advantages of the proposed methodology over current methods which are generally ad hoc and lack adequate capabilities for finding the optimal process parameters. The software SISSCOR is also introduced as a friendly graphical user interface for a fast experiment design and analysis of the dynamic performance associated with the rolling mill. This work will also review the application of a modified model-based approach {{in the form of the}} Generalised Predictive Control to reflect a Fuzzy l‚Â·Iodel of the mill. Such a hybrid strategy was implemented in order to provide robustness and flexibility to the overall control system, and to guarantee an optimal control performance during real-time operations.

5000|$|The {{competitive}} {{power rating}} span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts. CCVs {{are used for}} driving mine hoists, rolling mill main motors, ball mills for ore processing, cement kilns, ship propulsion systems, slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400 Hz power generation. The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, ball mills, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded [...] "hard start" [...] for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as <b>hot-rolling</b> steel <b>mills.</b> Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in electric traction applications to for example produce 25 Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3 Hz power in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|R
