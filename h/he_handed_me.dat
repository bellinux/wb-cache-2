60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{a letter}} {{addressed}} {{to me in}} Oscar's handwriting.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the letter. As soon as I had {{recovered}} myself, I looked at it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{the second}} of the two books which he had by him on the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Great heavens, sir!" [...] says he, [...] "into what {{a pretty}} guet-a-pens have you led me! Look at that letter, sir!--read that letter!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> one: ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] he says, [...] "I am {{a priest}} in spite of myself, but they call me Bishop now. Take this for my episcopal blessing," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> the paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chawls," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> over a tenpun-note, [...] "here's your wagis, {{and thank}} you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs: when you are married, you shall be my valet out of liv'ry, and I'll treble your salary." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a small sketch-book, and, while I {{turned over}} the leaves, busied himself in filling a short meerschaum.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the pilot house to report the good news to my companion <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a paper.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me,</b> apologetically for his scholarship, a {{piece of}} paper, and {{observed}} me while I looked it over. It was quite right.|$|E
6000|$|Worst of all, {{she listened}} {{to what he said}} in the night. Corp had a habit of talking in his sleep. He was usually taking tickets at such times, and it had been her custom to stop him violently; but now she changed her tactics: she {{encouraged}} him. [...] "I would be lying in my bed," [...] he said to Tommy, [...] "dreaming that a man had fallen into the Slugs, and instead o' trying to save him I cried out, 'Tickets there, all tickets ready,' and first <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a glove and neist <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a boot and havers o' that kind sich as onybody dreams. But in the middle o' my dream it comes ower me that I had better waken up to see what Gavinia's doing, and I open my een, and there she is, sitting up, hearkening avidly to my every word, and putting sly questions to me about the glove." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is desperately}} hurt," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>he</b> breathes. <b>Hand</b> <b>me</b> that revolver, Wilfrid, and run {{back and tell}} Mrs. Sampson her husband is hurt." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereupon {{the officer}} bade me sit down, {{and began to}} help me, and join in the meal. ‘I fill your ladyship’s glass,’ said <b>he,</b> and <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a tumbler of neat rum.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{went to the}} telephone. Mechanically <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the {{additional}} receiver. He asked for a number and presently received a reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{talked a}} bit about old acquaintances and other things, and then, having finished, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a {{sovereign}} and rose to go.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{the slip}} of paper which had marked the place in the book. It {{contained}} a few lines of writing, as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is well,' <b>he</b> answered, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> back my firelock. 'You {{see that}} we trust you, for your word, like ours, {{is not to be}} broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{picked up}} his book from the table, and took his pencil out of Cristel's hand, while we were speaking. [...] "I want my answer," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> {{the book and the}} pencil. I gave him his answer.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few moments}} he returned, {{carrying}} a long eagle feather in his <b>hand.</b> This <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me,</b> saying, [...] "My little boy--him dead. Him carry in dance dis fedder. You my friend. You take him." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the paper. I must {{own that}} the figures startled me. I laid {{it down with}} a fine show of indifference.|$|E
60|$|He {{had picked}} from a drawer a little {{tarnished}} cylinder, and, undoing the tape, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate-gray paper.|$|E
60|$|Umbopa {{rose to the}} occasion, {{and with}} {{something}} as nearly resembling a grin as I have ever seen on his dignified face <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the gun.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no!' he answered; 'but {{even before}} the coachman arrived, I had this {{telegram}} from the Boyar whose guest you are,' and he took from his pocket a telegram which <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me,</b> and I read: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>me</b> {{long and}} tenderly, beaming on me the while {{as though he}} had found a brother.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> it to <b>me,</b> and I tore it open. It {{contained}} {{only a few}} lines, in a large sprawling hand-writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] Brown said, as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> my cigar- case, [...] "but Mr. Harmmed has {{asked to see}} you before you go out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the circular. My heart {{gave one}} violent throb the instant I looked at it. I felt myself turn pale; I felt my knees {{trembling}} under me.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are five}} more to starboard. 'Ere's the original!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a paint-dappled copper stencil-plate, two feet square, bearing in the centre the six-inch initials, [...] "G.M." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, I ain't {{really his}} wife! My {{husband is a}} fine man--Mr. Kloh--Dlorus Kloh, my name is. Mr. Kloh's got a fine job with the mill, at North Yakima. Oh, I was a fool! This gambler Pinky Parrott, he comes along with his elegant ways, and <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> out a swell line of gab, and I ups and leaves poor Kloh, and the kid, and the nicest kid---- Say, please, could you folks take me {{wherever}} you're going? Maybe I could get a job again--used to was a good waitress, and I ain't going to wait here any longer for that lying, cheating, mean-talking----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No doubt,' said <b>he.</b> <b>'And</b> you've seen <b>me</b> {{along with}} warses of flowers, and {{any number of}} table-kivers, and antique cabinets, and warious gammon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said <b>he,</b> <b>'and</b> she bade <b>me</b> {{tell you}} that if you don't meet her at nine o'clock to-morrow you will never see her again.' ...|$|R
60|$|The next morning, Mr. Bruff {{surprised}} {{me at the}} breakfast-table. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a large key, and announced that he felt ashamed of himself {{for the first time}} in his life.|$|E
6000|$|We lads saluted in as sailorly {{a fashion}} as was possible, for {{we were not}} well up on such manners, and the {{commodore}} said abruptly as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a folded paper: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a telegram.--'Have {{not heard}} from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.--Holmwood.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Selby {{had read}} the {{telegram}} from Sir John <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> it to <b>me,</b> saying, [...] "It is only fair that you should see this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a brave man, sir," [...] said he. [...] "I have {{a present}} {{to make to}} you," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> a very tiny glass tube. [...] "It has been {{specially}} prepared by Dr. Fardet. At the supreme moment you have but to put it to your lips {{and you will be}} dead in an instant." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>me,</b> and bade me good-bye. I don't {{believe he}} has ever found anybody who could give him {{the answer to this}} puzzle.|$|R
