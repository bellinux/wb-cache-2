As a complementary analysis the volatility of the local foreign exchange <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> and the volatility of the foreign exchange spot were studied. The results concerning the foreign exchange swaps were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local foreign exchange <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure.</b> On the other hand, the swaps known as reversal foreign exchange swaps showed results that point out that the offer of this product by the Central Bank had no impact on the level of the local foreign exchange interest rate market.

40|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> is a {{function}} relating interest rate to term of maturity. <b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> {{is related to the}} idea of yield curve. Yield curve is a plot of interest rate yields on bill or bond with differing terms to maturity but with the same risk. The relationship between short and long interest rates and shape of yield curve are both explained by the following theories: expectations hypothesis and market segmentation hypothesis. The expectation hypothesis is not a homogenous theory and has several types. The expectations hypothesis can be divided into the pure expectations theory and weight expectations theory. The weight expectations theory can be divided into liquidity theory and preferred habitat theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of monetary policy actions in affecting the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure.</b> As a first approach, variations of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> in dates following a change in monetary policy stance are presented for the years 1998, 1999 and the first four months of 2000. Nevertheless, such variations in interest rates cannot be attributed solely to monetary policy decisions. This occurs since interest rates respond to various factors and events. Thus, it is important to decompose the effect of a change in monetary policy in two, a “reaction” (feedback) and an “active” (exogenous) component. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to analyze whether the increase in interest rates following a monetary restriction is due exclusively to changes in monetary policy (“active” monetary policy) or to events previously discounted by markets (“reaction” monetary policy). Using a vector autoregression technique, evidence is presented to support the fact that Mexican monetary policy has had an “active” component in the last years. monetary policy, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure,</b> “short”, vector autoregression, impulse-response function...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach to the modeling of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure.</b> It suggests that the total market price for risk {{is an important factor}} that has to be modeled carefully. The growth optimal portfolio, which is characterized by this factor, is used as reference unit or benchmark for obtaining a consistent price system. Benchmarked derivative prices are taken as conditional expectations of future benchmarked prices under the real world probability measure. The inverse of the squared total market price for risk is modeled as a square root process and shown to influence the medium and long term forward rates. With constant parameters and constant short rate the model already generates a hump shaped mean for the forward rate curve and other empirical features typically observed. <b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure,</b> growth optimal portfolio, fair pricing, market price for risk, square root process...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a nonparametric <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> model and {{investigate}} its implications on term structure dynamics and prices of interest rate derivative securities. The nonparametric spot interest rate process is estimated from the observed short-term interest rates following a robust estimation procedure and the market price of interest rate risk is estimated as implied from the historical term structure data. That is, instead of imposing a priori restrictions on the model, data are allowed to speak for themselves, and at the same time the model retains a parsimonious structure and the computational tractability. The model is implemented using historical Canadian <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> data. The parametric models with closed form solutions for bond and bond option prices, namely the Vasicek (1977) and CIR (1985) models, are also estimated for comparison purpose.

40|$|The {{constrained}} smoothing B-splines (COBS) {{is proposed}} as a nonparametric approach {{to estimate the}} <b>term</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Compared to the existing methods in the literature, COBS' main innovation lies in its incorporation of important constraints imposed by no-arbitrage, such as monotonically decreasing and boundary conditions for the discount function, positive forward and spot rates.

Estimation for high and low liquidity markets together with simulation exercises puts COBS in an intermediate position between usual parametric and nonparametric methods in the literature.
