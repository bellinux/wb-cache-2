This study investigates optimal <b>disclosure</b> strategies/formats in a channel setting with bilateral monopolies. It shows that retail <b>disclosure</b> leads to more equilibrium information revelation. This is because the manufacturer can, through wholesale price cuts, partially absorb the retailer's effective <b>disclosure</b> cost and thus increase the retailer's incentive for <b>disclosure.</b> The conditions under which a particular <b>disclosure</b> format arises as the manufacturer's optimal choice are also examined.

40|$|Invention <b>disclosure</b> is {{a complex}} problem faced by many {{university}} faculty members. Existing studies have investigated related issues, but few researchers have considered <b>disclosure</b> {{from the perspectives of}} both <b>disclosure</b> stage (early or late) and <b>disclosure</b> type (university or firm). This paper seeks to address this gap by investigating the influence of economic benefit, reputation, competition and collaboration on invention <b>disclosure.</b> We build several theoretical models, finding that reputation and competition have opposite effects on university <b>disclosure,</b> whereas economic benefit and collaboration are positively related to firm <b>disclosure.</b> We also find these four influencing factors have close relationships with <b>disclosure</b> stage. The simulation results further illustrate that initial reputation and additional reputation have different impacts on <b>disclosure</b> stage.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{potential}} for <b>disclosure</b> recommendations given by authoritative supervisory bodies to reduce information asymmetry between the management and shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – There is only meagre existing evidence concerning firms' responses to <b>disclosure</b> recommendations. This paper uses descriptive statistics and OLS regression analysis to test if firms behave more similarly to voluntary or to mandatory <b>disclosure</b> when they follow the Committee of European Securities Regulators <b>disclosure</b> recommendation for International Financial Reporting Standards transition. Second, it analyses the determinants of and incentives for recommended transition <b>disclosure.</b> Findings – Recommended <b>disclosure</b> is documented to have more mandatory characteristics than purely voluntary <b>disclosure.</b> Moreover, the certain <b>disclosure</b> incentives for managers and corporate governance factors prove {{to have an impact}} on recommended <b>disclosure.</b> Firm size, growth prospects, and independent board members associate positively with recommended <b>disclosure</b> whereas there is a negative relationship between financial leverage and recommended <b>disclosure.</b> Research limitations/implications – The paper does not provide evidence on the cost differences between <b>disclosure</b> laws and authoritative <b>disclosure</b> recommendations. This could be examined by future research. Practical implications – Authoritative <b>disclosure</b> recommendations reduce information asymmetry. In some cases they may be a faster and more cost-efficient way to achieve <b>disclosure</b> enhancements than regulation. Originality/value – This paper is the first {{to explore the}} efficiency of authoritative <b>disclosure</b> recommendations in situations where urgent <b>disclosure</b> improvements are needed.

40|$|<b>Disclosure</b> of HIV status {{has been}} the focus of three decades of research, which have {{revealed}} its complex relations to many behaviors involved in HIV prevention and treatment, and exposed its central role in managing the HIV epidemic. The causes and consequences of <b>disclosure</b> acts have recently been the subject of several theoretical models. Although it is acknowledged that individual <b>disclosure</b> events are part of a broader process of disclosing one's HIV status to an increasing number of people, this process has received less theoretical attention. In quantitative studies of <b>disclosure,</b> researchers have often implicitly assumed that <b>disclosure</b> is a single unidimensional process appropriately measured via the total number of one's <b>disclosure</b> acts. However, there is also evidence that <b>disclosure</b> may have different causes and consequences depending on the types of actors involved (e. g. family members, friends) and on the presence or absence of the discloser's intention, suggesting that the unidimensionality assumption may not hold. We quantitatively examined the dimensionality of voluntary and involuntary <b>disclosure</b> to different categories of actors, using data collected via structured interviews in the spring of 2010 from 158 people living with HIV in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. For voluntary <b>disclosure,</b> nonparametric item response analyses identified two multi-category clusters, family and community, and two single-category dimensions, partner and children. Involuntary <b>disclosure</b> consisted of several single- or two-category dimensions. Correlation analyses between the resulting <b>disclosure</b> dimensions and stigma and social support revealed distinct relationships for each <b>disclosure</b> dimension. Our results suggest that treating <b>disclosure</b> as a unidimensional construct is a simplification of <b>disclosure</b> processes that may lead to incorrect conclusions about <b>disclosure</b> correlates. We therefore recommend examining <b>disclosure</b> acts jointly to identify sample-specific dimensions before examining causes and consequences of <b>disclosure.</b> We propose a methodology for investigating <b>disclosure</b> processes, and recommend its adoption in future <b>disclosure</b> studies...|$|R

40|$|Thesis by publication. Includes bibliographical references. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} the theoretical determinants of voluntary greenhouse gas <b>disclosure</b> in Australia [...] Chapter 3. Voluntary greenhouse gas emission <b>disclosure</b> - impact on market-based performance [...] Chapter 4. Voluntary greenhouse gas emission <b>disclosure</b> - impact on accounting-based performance [...] Chapter 5. Conclusions. This research investigates the determinants and consequences of voluntary greenhouse gas (GHG) <b>disclosure</b> by non-GHG registered companies in Australia. Initial specific characteristics of a volunteer, and his/her presupposed knowledge of an action, {{play a significant role}} in the decision of taking a voluntary action (James, 1890). Based on this rationale, and consistent with the <b>disclosure</b> literature (e. g., Aerts et al., 2008; Ling, 2007), determinants and consequences of voluntary GHG <b>disclosure</b> by companies are examined as two possible dimensions for GHG <b>disclosure</b> decisions. This thesis is by publication and includes three papers. The first paper evaluates the determinants of GHG <b>disclosure,</b> using a number of firm-specific characteristics. The determinants are examined based on agency, legitimacy, stakeholder and voluntary <b>disclosure</b> theories. The second and third papers of this thesis examine the consequences of voluntary GHG <b>disclosure</b> on market-based and accounting based performance, respectively. A GHG <b>disclosure</b> index was developed based on the requirements in the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 and adapted from de Aguiar and Fearfull’s (2010) GHG <b>disclosure</b> index. The level of GHG <b>disclosure</b> was scored via content {{analysis of the}} annual reports (2009 to 2011 financial years) of non-GHG registered companies. The content analysis was validated by using a test-retest procedure. The first paper’s findings highlight a positive association between GHG <b>disclosure,</b> firm size and board independence. Further, it finds that companies with newer equipment are more likely to engage in discretionary <b>disclosure</b> and that foreign listing status plays a significant role in the GHG <b>disclosure</b> decision, suggesting that companies tend to view shareholders’ interests as a factor in determining GHG <b>disclosure.</b> The second paper indicates that a high level of debt cost in the previous year is a determinant for GHG <b>disclosure.</b> In the second paper, both linear regression and two-stage least squares regression analyses suggest that voluntary GHG <b>disclosure</b> is associated with a lower level of debt cost in the following year of <b>disclosure.</b> Also, it highlights that GHG <b>disclosure</b> has significant negative relationships with the bid-ask spread and return volatility in the following year of <b>disclosure.</b> The third paper, using a matched-pair research design in addition to linear regression and two-stage least squares regression analyses, also suggests that GHG <b>disclosure</b> has positive relationships with return on assets in the following year of <b>disclosure.</b> However, it does not provide evidence that the level of return on assets in the previous year of <b>disclosure</b> is a significant determinant for GHG <b>disclosure.</b> The second and third papers provide some evidence about the positive economic consequences of voluntary GHG <b>disclosure.</b> Overall, the research findings are consistent with the predictions of a cost-benefit framework. The findings indicate that managers tend to apply a cost-benefit framework based on likely trade-off between costs and benefits of <b>disclosure</b> (Garcia-Meca et al., 2005; Verrecchia, 1983, 1990, 2001) when deciding to disclose GHG voluntarily. The research outcome indicates that companies bear the extra voluntary <b>disclosure</b> costs to achieve the perceived benefits of voluntary <b>disclosure.</b> Overall, the thesis contributes to the GHG <b>disclosure</b> literature by responding to Simnett et al. ’s (2009) call for research to apply a collection of archival data to examine the characteristics of companies reporting their GHG emissions. Understanding the underlying determinants for voluntary GHG <b>disclosure</b> may help stakeholders to appreciate the benefits and limitations of this <b>disclosure.</b> The thesis further contributes to the voluntary GHG <b>disclosure</b> literature by bridging the existing gap between the determinants and consequences of voluntary GHG <b>disclosure.</b> The findings could be implemented in the cost-benefit analysis of non-disclosing companies for future <b>disclosure.</b> The findings also highlight the value relevance of GHG <b>disclosure</b> in financial markets, which could help stakeholders in their decision-making process. Also, the content analysis of the annual reports provides some clarity in respect of the most common aspects of GHG <b>disclosure</b> (e. g., actions to tackle GHG emission) by non-GHG registered companies. It helps stakeholders to understand the nature, scope and quality of GHG <b>disclosure.</b> Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xiii, 272 pages...|$|R
