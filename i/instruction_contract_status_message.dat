A vehicle can send its <b>status</b> <b>message</b> when the vehicle ahead of it in the sequence finishes transmitting its <b>status</b> <b>message.</b> Otherwise, if the vehicle did not hear the message of its head neighbor, it will send its message when its Tw(d) expires. After every successful transmission, each node updates its Tw(d) based on the distance from the last vehicle that successfully transmits its <b>status</b> <b>message.</b> Vehicles that are in front of the cluster head will wait until their cluster head takes its turn to send its <b>status</b> <b>message</b> (Type = 0) successfully. This is to eliminate the hidden terminal problem that could arise {{from the other side of}} the cluster.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of our user study about <b>status</b> <b>message</b> sharing on the Social Web. The study {{revealed}} the privacy and information noise (sometimes originating from gap of understanding and sometimes from lack of significance) to be the key problems in the domain and allowed us to unveil their nature. Further on we present the existing solutions and workarounds for those problems and introduce the idea that Semantic Web technologies could help confront those problems in a more complete way. We propose a way to use semantic descriptions of <b>status</b> <b>messages,</b> their intended audiences and distributed data about users to direct <b>status</b> <b>messages</b> to their intended recipients. Particularly, we rely on the Online Presence Ontology as a vocabulary for exposing <b>status</b> <b>message</b> semantics, and we provide necessary extensions to support <b>status</b> <b>message</b> directing...|$|R
