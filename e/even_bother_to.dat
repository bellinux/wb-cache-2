5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, {{and this}} led to a period of true stagnation. Shalmaneser IV (783-73 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is {{accredited}} to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who does not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty years Delaware {{politics}} were not unlike those of a state in the Deep South. In spite of a large minority of Republicans in New Castle County, hatred of the Republicans and their policies of racial equality, ran high {{throughout the rest of the}} state. There were years when the Republicans were unable to elect anyone to the General Assembly and years when they did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> nominate a candidate for Governor.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} they find a small faerie (who Nick has seen days before) playing with a message that Taloa had left for them, saying she had gone look for her {{surviving}} sisters alone. They catch the little faerie, whom Laurie names Sandspur and assumes to be a hobgoblin, based on the Field Guide. Later that day, two giants start fighting near their house. They escape with Jules, who can see the giants, {{but most of the}} development is destroyed. They go to Jack's house for help, but instead meet Jack's son (simply called Jack Junior), who tells them that he's taking his father to live with him and his wife. Noseeum Jack apologizes to Nick for not helping them and tells him he kept something for them in his backyard, which Nick doesn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> investigate.|$|E
25|$|Jake {{constantly}} {{worries about}} Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent {{in his next}} fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro {{in front of the}} local Mob boss, Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.|$|E

I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?' "; he eventually played nine parts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{particularly}} corrupt regimes, {{the voting}} process may {{be nothing more}} than a sham, as officials would simply announce whatever results they want, sometimes without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> count the votes. Such practices tend to draw international condemnation, but voters typically have little recourse, as there would seldom be any ways to remove the [...] "winner" [...] from power, short of a revolution.|$|R

She has feelings for Kanata as well as he accepts her for who she really is.|$|R
500|$|Internal dissent is also {{a regular}} feature of the group. A website {{associated}} with the group describes it as [...] "an Internet gathering" [...] with [...] "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives". Gabriella Coleman writes of the group, [...] "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} Grice's efforts {{the vote was}} held as planned, and to the {{surprise}} of everyone except Dredd, the Democrats actually lost. Democratic government had not existed for over forty years, and most citizens could not remember it. Most did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> vote at all, and of those who did, the majority decided to retain the status quo. A two-million-strong mass of democrats marched on the Grand Hall, believing this to be a fix, but Dredd was able to both convince Blondel Dupre that the result was accurate and break her will in front of the others, pressuring her to state in public [...] "you are the law." [...] Discredited and disheartened, mainstream support for democracy faded away.|$|E
500|$|Friday's form {{declined}} {{after his}} strong debut {{and his personal}} life remained troubled and chaotic, leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches. He {{was supposed to be}} living in Bristol, but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate Paul Went, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. [...] "He wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> have a shower", Went later said, in an interview. [...] "He'd just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he'd go—no explanation".|$|E
5000|$|Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{said that}} the ruling underscored [...] "the {{importance}} of the rules reform Senate Democrats enacted last November." [...] Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with the ruling: [...] "The President made an unprecedented power grab by placing political allies at a powerful federal agency while the Senate was meeting regularly and without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> wait for its advice and consent. A unanimous Supreme Court has rejected this brazen power-grab." ...|$|R
50|$|In another unconstitutional move, Pais on March 11, 1918 decreed {{the direct}} {{election}} of the President by plebiscite, through universal suffrage. Making use of his popularity among Catholics, he was elected on April 28, 1918, obtaining 470,831 votes, an unprecedented number. He was proclaimed President of the Republic on May 9 of the same year, without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> consult Congress, and enjoying direct democratic legitimacy, which he used - unsuccessfully - to crush opposition attempts.|$|R
25|$|He was Liberal {{candidate}} for the Bridgwater Division of Somerset at the 1906 General Election. It {{was the first time}} he had stood for parliament. He was not expected to win as the seat had been Unionist since it was created in 1885. In fact, the Liberal party had not <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> field a candidate at the two previous elections. However, in 1906 the country swung behind the Liberals and he gained Bridgwater by the margin of just 17 votes.|$|R
500|$|Marguerite {{remained}} silent of her ordeal for several days, until her husband's {{return on the}} 21 or 22 January. Upon hearing of the encounter, the outraged Carrouges summoned his circle of courtiers and friends, including his mother and most of Marguerite's family, and a council was convened where Marguerite repeated her account of the rape. Carrouges decided immediately to begin legal proceedings against Le Gris but faced great difficulties in prosecuting them as Le Gris was a favourite of Count Pierre, who would act as judge in the case. In addition, the case was weak because the only witness was Marguerite. Indeed, the trial at Argentan was so one-sided an affair that Carrouges and his wife did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> attend; Pierre acquitted Le Gris of all charges and furthermore accused Marguerite of inventing or even [...] "dreaming" [...] the attack.|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent {{was utterly}} {{confident}} {{of an election}} victory, {{so much so that}} he did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At his press conference detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, [...] "I have no doubt about the election outcome." [...] He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.|$|E

As he moves forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't {{get a good look at}} him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> look at his face while he garrotes him." ...|$|E

5000|$|Richard Bartle {{called out}} as {{advantages}} of permanent death: restriction of early adopters from permanently held positions of power, content reuse as players repeat early sections, its {{embodiment of the}} [...] "default fiction of real life", improved player immersion from more frequent character changes, and reinforcement of high level achievement.

Wilson's commission for privateering had expired, and his ship, the Julia DeForest, was at auction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nationalist}} {{forces were}} not very enthusiastic about reinforcing their former enemy at Gaoyou, and those from Yangzhou did not put too much fight and withdrew back to Yangzhou soon, while those nationalist troops from Taizhou, Jiangsu did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> send out anyone to reinforce Gaoyou. [...] Nonetheless, the nationalists had suffered a great debacle in winning popular support from local populace for attempting to reinforce their former enemy, the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime force.

They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in The Sporting News Baseball Guide during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s). The American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic [...] "Americans"). Media-driven nickname changes to the Doves in 1907 and the Rustlers in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the Braves {{for the first time in}} 1912.

2500|$|Arthur {{reported}} to the Colonial Office secretary in London that the Aboriginal people [...] "already complained that the white people have taken possession of their country, encroached upon their hunting grounds, and destroyed their natural food, the kangaroo" [...] and in a memo he proposed settling the Aboriginal people [...] "in some remote quarter of the island, which should be reserved strictly for them, and to supply them with food and clothing, and afford them protection ... on condition of their confining themselves peaceably to certain limits". He said Tasmania's northeast coast was the preferred location for such a reserve and suggested they remain there [...] "until their habits shall become more civilised". He pursued the proposal by issuing on 19 April 1828 a [...] "Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants" [...] that divided the island into two parts to regulate and restrict contact between blacks and whites. The northeast region was an area traditionally visited by many groups for its rich food reserves, and rivers, estuaries and sheltered bays {{as well as its}} mild climate. It was also largely unoccupied by colonists. But the proclamation partitioning the island also provided the first official sanction of the use of force to expel any Aboriginal people from the Settled Districts.
