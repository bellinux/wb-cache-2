5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

In 2009, however, Routh's contract to play Superman in another film expired, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time {{that he would like}} to return if given the chance. However, British actor Henry Cavill was cast to play Superman in the reboot of the series, Man of Steel.|$|E

500|$|As a High Court judge Denning sentenced {{people to}} death, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time [...] "didn't worry [...] in the least". Denning {{maintained}} that for murder, death {{was the most}} appropriate penalty, and that in cases where mistakes had been made there was always an appeals system. In the 1950s there was growing opposition {{to the use of}} the death penalty, and a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate abolishing it. Denning told the Commission in 1953 that [...] "the punishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of citizens for them".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 {{that he would not}} consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, [...] "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- [...] "give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been cited as an {{influence}} on director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] {{and wanted to know}} more." [...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up." [...] On the audio commentary for the DVD release of , Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting [...] "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.|$|E
500|$|Konietzko {{announced}} {{the return of}} KMFDM in early 2001, due to [...] "public demand", with Skold, Cifarelli, and former collaborators Watts and Rieflin joining him in the studio; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, [...] "I talked with the usual KMFDM suspects {{to see if they}} were interested, and what we came up with was something better than what we had before." [...] Recalled Esch in 2009, [...] "I was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so I refused the concept of a fast reunion of the original KMFDM." [...] Konietzko said of the reformed band, [...] "Not only is it fun again, but it's devoid of all the personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of the band," [...] but said, [...] "I really miss En Esch," [...] in 2003. KMFDM released its first album in three years, Attak, in March 2002. The album was on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at No.11.|$|E
500|$|Bill Murray was {{considered}} for the voice role of James P. [...] "Sulley" [...] Sullivan. He screen tested for the role and was interested, but when Pete Docter was unable {{to make contact with}} him, he took it as a [...] "no". The voice role of Sulley went to John Goodman, the longtime co-star of the comedy series Roseanne and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers. Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player. [...] "He's like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. [...] "He is totally dedicated and a total pro." [...] Billy Crystal, having regretted turning down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior, accepted that of Mike Wazowski, Sulley's one-eyed best friend and scare assistant. The casting of Steve Buscemi as Randall, Sulley's rival, saw a reunion between himself and John Goodman; they had previously worked together on The Big Lebowski and Barton Fink.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied who I am as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of that series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|Their {{relationship}} became strained {{during the}} making of 1980's Gaucho, largely due to their insistence for perfection. In addition, Becker {{was in the midst}} of a drug problem and both, they later recalled, seemed depressed. Though Fagen imagined they might [...] "stick it out for a while," [...] he admitted to Robert Palmer of The New York Times, in an article published on June 17, 1981, that the group had indeed separated. [...] "Basically, we decided after writing and playing together for 14 years, we could use a change mondaire as the French say," [...] he told Palmer. After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film Heavy Metal, which got him back in the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter. [...] "Working on it has been interesting. The fact that it's not a Steely Dan album has freed me from a certain image, a preconceived idea of how it'll sound," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Fagen had hoped to record music on his own [...] "a year or so" [...] prior to the duo's breakup. The album was originally slated to be titled Talk Radio.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{made plans}} in 1977 {{to sell the}} rights to his old {{television}} programs {{as part of a}} package which would bring him back to regular television appearances. [...] The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this appears to not have materialized. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a story that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. [...] Skelton contended his remarks were made {{at a time when he}} was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, [...] "Would you burn the only monument you've built in over 20 years?" [...] As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, Group W announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton's death.|$|E

500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that I {{wanted to get back}} to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E
500|$|As part of Parker's {{modernization}} efforts, {{the newspaper}} unit became the [...] "Public Information Division" [...] with Captain Stanley Sheldon in charge. He and Gene {{had known each}} other since Roddenberry attended Los Angeles City College. Roddenberry became Parker's speech writer, and wrote of the Chief's professional philosophy in the in-house magazine, The Beat, in September 1952. He reputedly based the Star Trek character Spock on Parker's rational and unemotional behavior. In this new office, he worked alongside Don Ingells, who would go on to create Fantasy Island, and write episodes for Star Trek such as [...] "The Alternative Factor". The Association for Professional Law Enforcement was founded on November 12, 1952, with Roddenberry as one of the founding members and spokesman. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that: [...] "We are of the opinion that professional ethics and practical police work are completely compatible and we intend to meet together to promote this compatibility." [...] Following this, Roddenberry began a correspondence with Erle Stanley Gardner, creator of the Perry Mason novels. The duo would record audio letters and send them to each other. Gardner forwarded Roddenberry's comments to Harry Steeger, who felt that he and Roddenberry had similar opinions on law enforcement. Gardner began to seek Roddenberry's opinion of his work, including allowing him a preview of The Court of Last Resort.|$|E
500|$|Yeddyurappa {{strongly}} {{denied any}} involvement {{of his government}} in the attacks, but admitted {{that the police were}} to blame for not taking precautionary measures, describing it as a [...] "dereliction of duty". He believed the attacks were a response from [...] "some vested interest trying to tarnish the secular image of his government". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> press conference, [...] "My government is committed to maintaining peace and harmony in the state; law and order has been top priority by my government.... Nobody is above law, irrespective of caste and creed the culprits will be punished". The state government ensured that special security was given to important places of worship throughout the state {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and Yeddyurappa set up a corps of detectives to investigate. He promised the Christian community leaders that all churches and shrines vandalised in the districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Chikkamagaluru during the attacks would be restored and paid a visit to all of the areas affected by communal riots and attacks. Some politicians such as former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS) national president H.D. Deve Gowda and M. P. Prakash also visited the Christian institutions in the aftermath. In February 2010, Yeddyurappa allocated 500millions for Christian development projects in Karnataka in his state budget, the first time he had ever done so.|$|E

500|$|Munro {{started the}} monthly party Vaseline (later renamed Vazaleen) in Toronto {{at a time}} when most gay clubs {{featured}} house music or other types of dance music. His hope was to draw a more diverse crowd: <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, [...] "I'd like to do something that'll encompass all the freaks out there, myself included." [...] In addition to its stereotype-countering incorporation of punk and other rock music, his club night was also noted to be unusual for being located outside of the Church and Wellesley gay neighbourhood. It was atypical as well for having about 50 percent women attending the event. Munro said, [...] "I was determined to get women to attend and I did it in a really simple way. I put lots of images of women and dyke icons on the posters and flyers—groups like The Runaways or singers like Nina Hagen and Carole Pope. I wanted women to know instantly that this was their space as much as anybody else's." [...] It began in the downstairs space at El Mocambo in late 1999, moved to the upstairs space in January 2000, and in late 2001, when El Mocambo was threatening to close, to Lee's Palace, where it continued as a monthly event until 2006; it continues to this day as an annual event as part the city's Pride Week festivities, to raise money for the Will Munro Fund for Queer and Trans People Living with Cancer.|$|E
500|$|The album saw {{the band}} take on {{much more of}} a commercially {{influenced}} sound, and also the appearance of Moog synthesizers, while being lyrically focused on a comedic approach, as with [...] "Seven Days in the Sun", but also dark emotions, such as those shown on [...] "Turn", [...] "Oxygen", and [...] "Satellite News". It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that [...] "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only {{a certain amount of money}} a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic. We've been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we're putting everything into this record and I'm just hoping that people like it". The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the [...] "Best British Live Act" [...] accolade at the Kerrang! awards, before ending the year supporting the Stereophonics, and then releasing the [...] "Just a Day" [...] single in December. In February 2015, [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] gained a silver certification for 200,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined.
