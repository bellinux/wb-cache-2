5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially <b>handing</b> <b>the</b> armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, <b>handing</b> <b>the</b> Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge.

With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from the start and by Craven Steps were almost clear.

5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State then drove the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the end zone. The Broncos chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and <b>handing</b> <b>the</b> ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|The central RSK {{authorities}} in Knin {{learned of the}} agreement through a report filed by the 18th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina on 26 February, eight days after it was signed. The main opposition to the agreement came from Milan Martić, the RSK Interior Minister. Leadership of the ruling Serb Democratic Party accused Džakula of <b>handing</b> <b>the</b> RSK territory to Croatia. The RSK leadership considered the Daruvar Agreement tantamount to admission of economic unfeasibility of the RSK and an act of treason. District council of the RSK-controlled western Slavonia condemned the agreement because it was enacted only in the Croatian language, and failed to note {{the existence of the}} RSK or its administrative divisions.|$|E
5|$|The ninth season saw a United States vs. United Kingdom {{theme for}} the show, with Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping {{coaching}} the respective sides.

The lightweight final saw Team Rough House teammates Andre Winner and Ross Pearson face off for the contract, with Pearson coming out on top via decision. The welterweight final saw James Wilks defeat DaMarques Johnson via submission in the opening round, <b>handing</b> <b>the</b> UK team a 2-0 victory.|$|E
50|$|First compare <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> types.

If both <b>the</b> dealer's <b>hand</b> and <b>the</b> player's <b>hand</b> have <b>the</b> same <b>hand</b> type, <b>the</b> numerical value taem is compared. If one hand has a greater taem than <b>the</b> other, that <b>hand</b> wins. <b>The</b> amount won is <b>the</b> winning <b>hand's</b> deng. If both <b>hands</b> have <b>the</b> same <b>hand</b> type and taem, the deng is compared. If one hand has a greater deng than <b>the</b> other, that <b>hand</b> wins <b>the</b> payout of the difference of the hands' deng. If both <b>hands</b> have <b>the</b> same <b>hand</b> type, taem, and deng, they tie and the original bet is returned to the player.|$|R
50|$|Next, {{each player}} (including the dealer) is given one stack of tiles and must {{use them to}} form two hands of two tiles each. <b>The</b> <b>hand</b> with <b>the</b> lower value is called <b>the</b> front <b>hand,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> with <b>the</b> higher value is called <b>the</b> rear <b>hand.</b> If a player's front <b>hand</b> beats <b>the</b> dealer's front <b>hand,</b> and <b>the</b> player's rear <b>hand</b> beats <b>the</b> dealer's rear <b>hand,</b> then that player wins the bet. If a player's front and rear hands both lose to <b>the</b> dealer's {{respective}} <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> player loses the bet. If one <b>hand</b> wins and <b>the</b> other loses, the player is said to push, and gets back only the money he or she bet. Generally seven players will play, and each player's hands are compared only against <b>the</b> dealer's <b>hands.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Graham was {{discharged}} from the Navy late {{in the summer of}} 1946, training camp for Brown's new team, the Cleveland Browns, had already begun. Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in Cliff Lewis at quarterback in {{the first game of the}} season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown's T formation offense. <b>Handing</b> <b>the</b> ball to fullback Marion Motley and throwing to ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Graham led the team to a 12–2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the AAFC's New York Yankees. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's second perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied.|$|E
