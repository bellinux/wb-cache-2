5|$|Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> (Phodopus campbelli) is {{a species}} of <b>hamster</b> in the genus Phodopus. It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honour of C. W. Campbell (Charles William Campbell), who {{collected}} the first specimen in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian <b>hamster</b> as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to the Djungarian <b>hamster</b> and grey fur on the stomach.|$|E
5|$|The Djungarian <b>hamster</b> (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian <b>hamster,</b> striped dwarf <b>hamster,</b> Siberian <b>hamster,</b> Siberian dwarf <b>hamster</b> or Russian winter white dwarf <b>hamster,</b> is one of three species of <b>hamster</b> in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian <b>hamster,</b> so is called a dwarf <b>hamster</b> along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian <b>hamster</b> include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, the {{gestation}} period for Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> is between 18 and 20 days, and the shortest {{gestation period}} recorded for a captive female was 13 days. The male <b>hamster</b> {{is likely to}} assist the female during birth. The male may pull the offspring from the birth canal, clean them, or collect food for the mother and offspring.|$|E
50|$|Scientists use male <b>hamsters</b> {{to study}} the effects of steroids on male {{behavior}}. The behavior of castrated <b>hamsters</b> is compared to typical male <b>hamsters.</b> Castrated <b>hamsters</b> are then given steroids and their behavior noted. Some steroid treatments will cause castrated <b>hamsters</b> to do behaviors that typical male <b>hamsters</b> do.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hamsters</b> should {{experience}} {{light for}} 12-16 hours a day. Among other health effects, daily exposure to light influences the estrous cycle of females and <b>hamsters</b> thrive with regular light. <b>Hamsters</b> prefer humidity levels of 40-60%. Breeding <b>hamsters</b> prefer a room temperature between 69 F and 71 F, whereas <b>hamsters</b> {{who are not}} breeding prefer between 72 F and 74 F. <b>Hamsters</b> prefer quiet rooms and become stressed when sudden noise disturbs them.|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin {{levels in}} serum and saliva were {{measured}} in 2 - 3 -month-old <b>hamsters</b> and in approximately 2 -year-old <b>hamsters.</b> Salivary IgA concentrations in aged <b>hamsters</b> were slightly, but not significantly, {{higher than in}} young <b>hamsters.</b> Salivary volumes were generally greater in aged <b>hamsters,</b> resulting in a significantly increased total amount of IgA secreted per unit time. Serum IgG levels were somewhat elevated in aged <b>hamsters</b> while serum IgM levels were generally higher in the young <b>hamsters.</b> Serum IgA levels were markedly elevated in aged <b>hamsters.</b> Immune responses to the soluble protein enzyme, glucosyltransferase, from Streptococcus mutans strain 6715, were measured after injection of this antigen incorporated into Freund's complete adjuvant in the salivary gland vicinity. Salivary IgA responses were measured by an ELISA procedure and were lower in aged <b>hamsters</b> compared with young <b>hamsters,</b> after primary or secondary immunization. The serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were in general not significantly different {{between the two groups}} of animals. Sera from young and aged <b>hamsters</b> did not differ in their capacity to inhibit the ability of GTF to synthesize glucan from sucrose...|$|R
5|$|In the wild, the {{breeding}} season for Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> varies by location. For example, {{the breeding}} season begins towards {{the middle of}} April in Tuva and {{towards the end of}} April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E
5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human <b>Hamster</b> Wheel, an oversized <b>hamster</b> wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a gigantic gumball machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
5|$|Original; {{this is a}} short {{song about}} the titular <b>hamster.</b> From the 1993 album Alapalooza.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hamsters</b> first gained {{popularity}} as pets in the 1930s, {{with virtually}} all modern Syrian <b>hamsters</b> tracing their lineage {{back to a}} single litter of <b>hamsters</b> taken to Palestine for scientific research in 1930. <b>Hamsters</b> were first brought to the United States in 1938.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hamsters</b> are {{seasonal}} breeders {{and will}} produce several litters {{a year with}} several pups in each litter. The breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian <b>hamsters,</b> 18 to 21 days for Russian <b>hamsters,</b> 21 to 23 days for Chinese <b>hamsters</b> and 23 to 30 for Roborovski <b>hamsters.</b> The average litter size for Syrian <b>hamsters</b> is about seven pups, but can be as great as 24, which is {{the maximum number of}} pups that can be contained in the uterus. Campbell's dwarf <b>hamsters</b> tend to have four to eight pups in a litter, but can have up to 13. Djungarian <b>hamsters</b> tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski <b>hamsters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Royal House of Hamsteria is an {{institution}} created in 1999 to recognise <b>hamsters.</b> All <b>hamsters</b> are related {{and this particular}} family {{is a symbol of}} <b>Hamsters</b> worldwide.|$|R
5|$|A <b>hamster</b> {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|This <b>hamster</b> {{is listed}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is native to China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russian Federation.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5000|$|The mouse-like <b>hamsters</b> are {{not true}} <b>hamsters,</b> but {{represent}} an early split {{from the rest of}} the mouse-like rodents. They were once thought to be <b>hamsters</b> based on the shape of their molars, but they lack the cheek pouches, flank glands and short tails of the true <b>hamsters.</b> The closest relatives of the mouse-like <b>hamsters</b> may be the extinct Cricetodontidae. Because of their seemingly early break {{from the rest of the}} mouse-like rodents, mouse-like <b>hamsters</b> have been placed in a family of their own, Calomyscidae, and have been referred to as living fossils.|$|R
50|$|Atherosclerosis may {{be studied}} with Syrian <b>hamsters</b> because both {{organizations}} have similar lipid metabolism. <b>Hamsters</b> develop atherosclerosis {{as a result}} of dietary manipulation. <b>Hamsters</b> develop atherosclerotic plaques as humans do.|$|R
50|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{studied in}} various ways using Syrian <b>hamsters.</b> <b>Hamsters</b> which are feed fructose for 7 days get hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. Such <b>hamsters</b> then have an increase in hepatic lipase and other measurable responses which are useful for understanding diabetes in humans. Streptozotocin or alloxan may be administered to induce chronic diabetes in <b>hamsters.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified to be consumed by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a <b>hamster</b> inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E
40|$|Equine {{abortion}} virus (EAV) -induced hepatitis in <b>hamsters</b> {{presents an}} interesting animal {{model for the}} evaluation of drugs possessing anti-deoxyribonucleic acid virus activity. These experiments demonstrate that 9 -β-d-arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine 5 ′-monophosphate (ara-HxMP), a new synthetic, water-soluble, antiviral agent, effectively controls this disease in <b>hamsters</b> with a therapeutic index of ∼ 60. Ara-HxMP prevented hepatitis-associated deaths in <b>hamsters,</b> reduced the titer of EAV developing in <b>hamsters,</b> and inhibited the increase of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase in EAV-infected <b>hamsters...</b>|$|R
40|$|LH surges occur 3 h {{later in}} intact {{anovulatory}} <b>hamsters</b> exposed to nonstimulatoryphotoperiods (6 L: 18 D) for 8 wk than the proestrous LH surges {{from the same}} <b>hamsters</b> housed in 6 L: 18 D for 3 weeks. In ovariec-tomized <b>hamsters</b> housed in 6 L: 18 D for 3 wk, the LH surge was observed {{at the same time}} of day as in intact anovulatory <b>hamsters</b> at 8 wk. Implanting Silastic capsules containing estradiol benzoate (EB) advanced the timing of the daily surge of LH in ovariectomized <b>hamsters</b> housed in 6 L: 18 D for 8 wk. EB also affected the magnitude of the LH surge in <b>hamsters</b> housed in 6 L: 18 D for 8 wk. Two days after receiving ER implants, daily LH surges in anovulatory <b>hamsters</b> were suppressed by 75 % and in ovariectomized “regressed ” <b>hamsters</b> by 37 %. This difference between groups was probably due to ovarian progesterone in intact animals. Estrogen is not required for LH surges in anovulatory <b>hamsters</b> but suppresses LH release when administered exogenously. The delay in the timing of the LH surge in an ovulatory <b>hamsters</b> may result from the decline in estrogen resulting from short photoperiod exposure...|$|R

5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a <b>hamster</b> consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian <b>hamster.</b> They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the role of the circadian system in mediating short photoperiod responsivness in Siberian <b>hamsters.</b> The first study indicated that variation in photoperiodic responsiveness exists in Siberian <b>hamsters,</b> and that the proportion of photoperiod nonresponders (PNR) increases with age. Furthermore, this was the first study in which it was shown that PNR Siberian <b>hamsters</b> fail to exhibit inhibition of serum follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin concentrations, in addition to failing to exhibit testicular regression and the molt to winter type pelage. The second set of experiments indicated that PNR <b>hamsters</b> exhibit differences in their circadian organization as compared to short day responsive <b>hamsters.</b> PNR <b>hamsters</b> exhibited shorter durations of activity when exposed to short day lengths, and they began locomotor activity later in the dark period, as compared to short day responsive <b>hamsters.</b> PNR <b>hamsters</b> also exhibited a longer free running period lengths of activity onset in constant darkness as compared to responsive <b>hamsters.</b> This difference in the circadian system is thought to be partly responsible for mediating photoperiod nonresponsiveness. Running wheel access in short days elicited short day responses in PNR <b>hamsters.</b> The neural pathway involved in relaying this nonphotic stimulus to the circadian system was examined in a third set of experiments. It was shown that chemical lesions of the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus block the effect of running wheel activity in PNR <b>hamsters.</b> It was also shown that the intergeniculate leaflet may be involved in day length measurement in responsive <b>hamsters.</b> Finally, it was shown that altering the phase angle of entrainment to short light pulses in short day-responsive <b>hamsters</b> can result in photostimulation of the testes. ...|$|R
40|$|Infant <b>hamsters</b> of {{different}} ages were examined for their susceptibility to enteric Clostridium difficile colonization. Intragastric administration of C. difficile to infant <b>hamsters</b> resulted in multiplication of the organism in the intestinal tracts of animals 4 to 12 days old; <b>hamsters</b> younger or older were resistant to C. difficile intestinal colonization. Toxicity to the colonized animals could not be demonstrated despite cytotoxin titers in some infant <b>hamsters</b> comparable to titers found in the intestinal tracts of adult <b>hamsters</b> with C. difficile-associated intestinal disease. When introduced into 4 -day-old <b>hamsters,</b> C. difficile colonized the intestinal tract and remained at high levels until the animals were 13 days old, at which time the presence of intestinal C. difficile {{could no longer be}} demonstrated. The number of C. difficile required to colonize the intestinal tracts of 50 % of 7 -day-old <b>hamsters</b> was 18 viable cells. On the other hand, 10 (8) viable cells of C. difficile failed to colonize the intestinal tracts of healthy, non-antibiotic-treated adult <b>hamsters...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} Syrian <b>hamsters</b> {{to examine the}} role of {{pre-existing}} immunity to adenovirus (Ad) 5 in the toxicity of the oncolytic Ad vector INGN 007. Groups of <b>hamsters</b> were or were not immunized with Ad 5. Half the <b>hamsters</b> were immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide (CP), then injected intravenously (i. v.) with 3 × the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INGN 007 (in immunocompetent <b>hamsters),</b> and toxicity and vector replication in the liver were quantitated. In nonimmunized immunocompetent <b>hamsters,</b> toxicity was observed early but the <b>hamsters</b> recovered by day 6 after vector injection. In nonimmunized immunosuppressed <b>hamsters,</b> the vector was lethal by 3 days. Pre-existing neutralizing antibody (NAb) prevented liver infection and hepatotoxicity in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed <b>hamsters.</b> In another study, passive immunization of immunosuppressed <b>hamsters</b> 1 day before a lethal dose (1 × MTD) of INGN 007 prevented liver infection and replication, but immunization 1 day after vector administration was barely effective. When immunosuppressed <b>hamsters</b> were passively immunized 1 day after injection of 1 / 3 rd the MTD of INGN 007, then significant protection was observed against liver infection and toxicity. Therefore, serum NAb are sufficient to prevent oncolytic Ad vector liver infection and toxicity. We saw no evidence that pre-existing immunity was associated with increased vector toxicity...|$|R
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf <b>hamster</b> in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian <b>hamster</b> on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a <b>hamster</b> remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hamsters</b> were immunized with thimerosal-killed Borrelia burgdorferi 297 or a mutant of 297 (M 297) {{that lacks}} the 49 -kb linear plasmid and {{expression}} of outer surface proteins A and B (OspA and OspB). Ixodes scapularis nymphs infected {{with either the}} B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain 297 or JMNT, similar in OspA and OspB but differing in OspC expression, were used to evaluate protection. In a homologous challenge, 24 <b>hamsters</b> were vaccinated, 8 each with 297 or M 297 and 8 sham (adjuvant) -vaccinated controls. <b>Hamsters</b> vaccinated with either bacterin were completely protected against a natural tick bite or subcutaneous (s. c.) inoculation of 297. Borreliae were effectively eliminated from 80 to 90 % of the 297 -infected ticks that fed on four <b>hamsters</b> immunized with the 297 bacterin. Cultures of spirochetes isolated from the ticks that remained infected were infectious and induced joint inflammation in naive <b>hamsters.</b> There was no reduction of strain 297 spirochetes in ticks that fed on four <b>hamsters</b> immunized with M 297, but the <b>hamsters</b> were protected. Results with the M 297 bacterin indicate that proteins other than OspA or OspB can protect <b>hamsters</b> against a tick challenge without eliminating B. burgdorferi in the tick. In a heterologous challenge, 36 <b>hamsters</b> were vaccinated, 12 with each bacterin and 12 controls. None of the <b>hamsters</b> immunized with either bacterin were protected from a challenge involving JMNT-infected ticks, while two of four were protected against an s. c. challenge. <b>Hamsters</b> challenged s. c. with strain 297 spirochetes were protected. There was partial elimination of JMNT spirochetes in ticks that fed on the group of four <b>hamsters</b> immunized with the 297 bacterin, and infection rates were reduced by 50 to 60 %. JMNT spirochetes reisolated from the ticks that fed on 297 -vaccinated <b>hamsters</b> also remained infectious for <b>hamsters.</b> In the JMNT-infected ticks that fed on four M 297 -immunized <b>hamsters,</b> there was no decline {{in the proportion of}} infected ticks. Destruction of spirochetes in ticks that fed on the <b>hamsters</b> vaccinated with the 297 bacterin suggests that antibodies to OspA and OspB may have been responsible, since the mutant did not induce this activity...|$|R
