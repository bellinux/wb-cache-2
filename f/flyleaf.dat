5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the <b>flyleaf</b> {{we know that it}} was in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as Wherever You Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band <b>Flyleaf,</b> and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E

2500|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} that Eric Harris asked if Bernall believed in God moments before he fatally shot her. She {{was reported to}} have answered [...] "Yes". This story led to Bernall being presented as a martyr by some Christians, and served as the inspiration for several songs, including <b>Flyleaf's</b> [...] "Cassie" [...] and Michael W.

25|$|The incantations were {{recorded}} in the 10th century by a literate cleric, possibly in the abbey of Fulda, on a blank page of a liturgical book, which later passed to the library at Merseburg. The incantations have thus been transmitted in Caroline minuscule on the <b>flyleaf</b> of a Latin sacramentary.|$|E
25|$|Some Christian {{artists as}} Third Day, Kutless, Thousand Foot Krutch and Disciple have sung songs that carry overtly Christian messages. Bands such as Underoath, Blessthefall and Haste the Day {{incorporate}} symbolism and Christian messages more indirectly. Bands such as <b>Flyleaf</b> {{do not call}} themselves Christian bands, though they state that their Christian faith affects their lyrics. Bands such as Switchfoot have said they try to write music for both Christians and non-Christians alike.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Poirot is {{contacted by}} Maude Williams, who had approached {{him a few}} days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid {{in the house of}} Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the postmistress's assistant, Edna, saw someone with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the <b>flyleaf,</b> suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription “my mother” on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer – Robin Upward.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Wells paid $200,000 for {{the right}} to print a limited run (1,024 copies) of the {{definitive}} edition of Mark Twain's writings.

40|$|This study {{offers a}} contextual {{analysis}} {{of the creation of}} Cambrai, Médiathèque Municipale, MS. 125 - 8 (olim 124). These partbooks originated in Bruges, 1542 and belonged to the merchant Zeghere van Male. Drawing on methods of urban musicology, the manuscript is positioned within the context of bourgeois culture. A first part considers the manuscript as a physical object, focussing on its creation and post-compilation history. Archival and palaeographical research together with an investigation of contemporary social and cultural life in Bruges results in the identification of the scribe and the binder, and in a strong hypothesis regarding the identity of the illuminator. The compilation network that lies at the basis of the manuscripts creation is thus recovered. Scrutiny of the pages moreover reveals the scribal approach and working method, and proves that the manuscript contains at least two, possibly three, layers that were probably copied in quick succession. Examination of post-sixteenth-century <b>flyleafs</b> and foliation hands show that the manuscript was owned and restored by different people or institutions before its arrival in the St Sépulchre Abbey, from where it was confiscated during the French Revolution after which it became part of the collection of the Cambrai library. A second part deals with the musical repertoire. The manuscript is a repository of music that was available in the city at that time. Repertoire that can be linked to the Bruges environment is discussed. Special attention is paid to the scribes attributions, which hold information on the network from which he possibly retrieved his music supply. Editorial practices are briefly touched upon. CambraiBM 125 - 8 contains many unique compositions. For one of these, the anonymous motet Salve quadruplicem gestans Godeleva coronam, a possible Bruges context is presented. The motet is further analysed as a case study in local repertoire and {{as a representative of the}} workmanship of the average composer. The urban context of the source remains central throughout this study. The scribal identification gives a new dimension to all other data and unequivocally results in important additions to and adjustments of current musicological knowledge of bourgeois musical culture in the Low Countries during the first half of the sixteenth century. status: publishe...|$|R
500|$|When {{the band}} was first started, their lead vocalist {{introduced}} them to bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, and the group has since cited them as major influences to their musical style. The group is considered to have launched the careers of {{three members of the}} nu metal band Korn. Drummer David Silveria said that [...] "L.A.P.D. really was good for us because we learned about the industry and how things work."

500|$|Ultimately, Chesnutt is {{challenging}} {{the idea of}} two [...] "races." [...] The story serves as an allegory of the changing relationship of freeborn and freedmen, mixed race and blacks, in a post-Reconstruction Era. Such differences are expressed in language used by the characters, which also reflects differing education and class levels. Ryder speaks in the high rhetoric of [...] "white" [...] English (emulating the Tennyson he reads) while 'Liza uses a thick black dialect. That difference is further emphasized by Ryder's writing 'Liza's address in the <b>flyleaf</b> of his Tennyson book and, when recounting her story, switching into his own [...] "soft dialect". Ann duCille suggests the story questions the legality of marriage during enslavement.

In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
