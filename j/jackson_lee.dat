25|$|In June 1863, Robert E. Lee {{decided to}} {{capitalize}} on his victory at Chancellorsville by repeating his strategy of 1862 and once again invading the North. He did this to resupply his army, give the farmers of Virginia a respite from war, and threaten the morale of Northern civilians, possibly by seizing an important northern city, such as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or Baltimore, Maryland. The Confederate government agreed to this strategy only reluctantly because Jefferson Davis {{was concerned about the}} fate of Vicksburg, Mississippi, the river fortress being threatened by Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg campaign. Following the death of <b>Jackson,</b> <b>Lee</b> organized the Army of Northern Virginia into three corps, led by Lt. Gens. James Longstreet, Richard S. Ewell, and A.P. Hill.|$|E

The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative Sheila <b>Jackson</b> <b>Lee</b> (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, [...] "Shame on you.... As a parent, I'm on the verge of tears," [...] and said, [...] "I want to know what you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!"

2500|$|On 21 April 1915, John R. Lee—a {{big game}} hunter and {{veteran of the}} Second Boer War—arrived at the Admiralty to meet Admiral Sir Henry <b>Jackson.</b> <b>Lee</b> had been in Eastern Africa and had {{personally}} observed the German ships on Lake Tanganyika. He also brought {{the news that the}} Germans were preparing to launch a new ship from their fortified port of Kigoma. Named Graf von Götzen, she had been constructed at the Meyer shipyard at Papenburg, disassembled and packed into 5,000 crates and transported to Dar-es-Salaam. From there, she had been brought by rail to Kigoma and assembled in secret. [...] long and displacing , she would cement German control of the lake and allow 800-900 troops to be rapidly transported to any point on the lakeshore to raid into allied territory.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{was engaged}} {{for a time}} in the late 1950s to Henriette von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to {{interview}} Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., John Boulting, and Joe <b>Jackson.</b> <b>Lee</b> found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were [...] "killing me with cream". Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before whilst filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing. However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she [...] "deserved better" [...] than being [...] "pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor". She understood, and they called the wedding off.|$|E
2500|$|Davis's case gained {{increasing}} {{public exposure}} {{and support from}} organizations and prominent individuals. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged the courts to agree {{to hear the evidence}} of police coercion and recanted testimony. An appeal to Governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue urging him to spare Davis's life was sent on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Similar appeals were sent by singer Harry Belafonte, Sister Helen Prejean, author of Dead Man Walking, and actor Mike Farrell. Amnesty International published a report about Davis's case characterizing it as a miscarriage of justice and a [...] "catastrophic flaw in the U.S. death penalty machine." [...] The human rights group initiated a letter-writing campaign and delivered 4,000 letters to the clemency board. William S. Sessions, former FBI Director and federal judge, called on authorities to halt the execution process, writing that [...] "t would be intolerable to execute a man without his claims of innocence ever being considered by the courts or by the executive". Politicians and others such as Jesse Jackson, Jr. and Sheila <b>Jackson</b> <b>Lee,</b> and former Texas District Attorney Sam D. Millsap, Jr., and the organization Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation requested that the courts grant Davis a new trial. U.S. Congressman John Lewis spoke to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, suggesting that Coles – one of the witnesses who had not recanted – was the real killer. Representatives from the Council of Europe and European Parliament also spoke out on Davis's case, asking U.S. authorities to halt the planned execution and calling for a new trial.|$|E
