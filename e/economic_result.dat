Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Z-bars, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. While prices for a black market substance vary wildly in time and geography, this author's personal research of {{the past fifteen years}} throughout California bears out $2.00 prices for 1mg pills (often referred to as footballs or even more anecdotally, //ones//) and $4.00 for 2mg pills (often referred to as bars, spinners, and ladders). More recently (Summer, 2017) prices for 1mg and 2mg have risen to $3-$4 and $5-$8 respectively.

Among the components of the institutional capital, the highest influence on the <b>economic</b> <b>results</b> indicated by the selected samples is exerted by the macroeconomic environment, and, within this environment, by the country rating and the macroeconomic stability. institutional capital, public institutions, macroeconomic environment, indicators, econometric models, regression analysis, testing multicolinearity, production function. ...|$|R

It was found that supplement of cereal, rapeseed/cereals or grass pellets gave very similar productivity and <b>economic</b> <b>result,</b> but supplement of rapeseed cake reduced crop production and <b>economic</b> <b>result.</b> Increased level of grazing has a smaller positive effect on the <b>economic</b> <b>result.</b> On the assumption of a positive effect on milk yield persistency and feed intake per cow, increased calving interval has a positive effect on the productivity and <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> of the organic dairy farm...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of my bachelor work {{was to assess}} the way of accounting and of valuation of inventory in a specific organization and their influence on the <b>economic</b> <b>result.</b> To carry out the analysis of the existing way of accounting and valuation in the organization and to compare it with other possible ways, to compare and assess the influence of individual methods on the <b>economic</b> <b>result,</b> to evaluate the result and to suggest suitable recommendations. Each of the possible accounting methods and of the valuation can influence the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> either directly or indirectly. The <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> can be influenced by the directly chosen accounting method of the valuation, i. e. directly in the accounts of expenses and revenues. It might be however influenced indirectly, e. g. by the laboriousness of some of the applied methods, which could cause higher wage expenses. A change of the method can also affect the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> {{in such a way that}} the change will be more demanding, more laborious and more expensive than the resulting effect. In the theoretical part I have described in detail the possible procedures of accounting and valuation of inventory, permitted by the legislation of the Czech Republic. In the practical part I have specified the accounting procedures and the valuation of inventory in our company. I have carried out the analysis of the existing procedures of accounting and valuation of inventory. Further I have analysed other possible methods. I have assessed the individual methods not only from the point of view of their direct influence on the <b>economic</b> <b>result,</b> but also their laboriousness and the administrative and economic demands. I have compared the results mutually. Based on those analyses I offered a recommendation, which would be, in my opinion, a benefit for our organization. First of all it would bring a lower laboriousness and less administrative demands. The actual direct influence on the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> is not too significant, however the work simplification will bring an important effect to the organization. I recommended the change of accounting and of the inventory valuation. I believe that even the valuation of finished product stock would bring a benefit...|$|E

It {{is an expression of}} value of business transformation process. It represents the criterion for deciding on the volume of production, new products, investments, etc. In the interests of stability and the further development of each enterprise we need to pay attention to it {{not only in terms of}} level, but also the factors that affect it. On the basis of the above, there was created a process model of decomposition of the <b>economic</b> <b>result.</b> It consists of the knowledge and the analysis of its reference point, defining target value, making variations in order to achieve the target value, the determination of the means to achieve it, establishing the criteria for the selection of variant, selection of the most appropriate variant, implementation of concrete measures, finding the actual condition of the creation of <b>economic</b> <b>result,</b> findings and analyses of the deviations, adoption of measures. The aim of the paper is the generalisation of the results arising from the creation and application of process model of <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> decomposition and drawing conclusions and recommendations.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of inequality {{in the distribution of}} the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> in businesses engaging in field production in the Czech Republic, by way of the assessment of the impact of subsidies on the said inequality and by defining the effect {{of the size of the}} business on the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> as well as inequality. The methodical tool is the quantification of the Gini coefficient and its elasticity. The data basis consists of panel data of 140 agricultural businesses focusing on field production for the period of the years 2005 ‚Äì 2010. The main results of the submitted article substantiate a high inequality in the distribution of the <b>economic</b> <b>result</b> for the accounting period among field production businesses. The said inequality is not generally caused by the differing size of the analyzed businesses, and the associated volume of subsidies obtained, but is affected by other factors, such as the management quality, the investment activity of the business, or exceptional events. Subsidies do contribute to the more equal distribution of the <b>economic</b> <b>result,</b> but their impact is very small. Out of the individual categories of subsidies, the ones with the main redistribution effect are direct payments, as a result of the high proportion of total subsidies that they comprise...|$|E
