25|$|LNG {{facilities}} provide {{delivery capacity}} during peak periods when market demand exceeds pipeline <b>deliverability.</b> LNG storage tanks possess {{a number of}} advantages over underground storage. As a liquid at approximately −163°C (−260°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high <b>deliverability</b> at very short notice because LNG storage facilities are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding pipeline tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas and it allows access to a global supply. LNG facilities are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new underground storage facilities.|$|E
25|$|Base gas (also {{referred}} to as cushion gas): It is the volume of gas that is intended as permanent inventory in a storage reservoir to maintain adequate pressure and <b>deliverability</b> rates throughout the withdrawal season.|$|E
25|$|Injection {{capacity}} (or rate): It is {{the amount}} of gas that can be injected into a storage facility on a daily basis. It {{can be thought of as}} the complement of the <b>deliverability.</b> Injection rate is also typically measured in millions of cubic feet of gas that can be delivered per day (MMcf/day).|$|E
25|$|Deliverability: It is {{a measure}} of the amount of gas that can be {{delivered}} (withdrawn) from a storage facility on a daily basis. It is also referred to as the <b>deliverability</b> rate, withdrawal rate, or withdrawal capacity and is usually expressed in terms of millions of cubic feet of gas per day (MMcf/day) that can be delivered.|$|E
25|$|Reservoir quality {{parameters}} {{almost always}} include porosity and permeability, but may include measures of clay content, cementation factors, {{and other factors}} that affect the storage and <b>deliverability</b> of fluids contained in the pores of those rocks. Geostatistical techniques are most often used to populate the cells with porosity and permeability values that are appropriate for the rock type of each cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{deregulation}} {{activity in}} the underground gas storage arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group would take more market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this group accounts for 18 percent of overall storage <b>deliverability</b> and 13 percent of working gas capacity in the US.|$|E
25|$|Intrastate {{pipeline}} companies use {{storage facilities}} for operational balancing and system supply {{as well as}} to meet the energy demand of end-use customers. LDCs generally use gas from storage to serve customers directly. This group operates 148 underground storage sites and account for 40 percent of overall storage <b>deliverability</b> and 32 percent of working gas capacity in the US. These operators include Consumers Energy Company and the Northern Illinois Gas Company (Nicor), in the US and Enbridge and Union Gas in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} companies {{rely heavily}} on underground storage to perform load balancing and system supply management on their long-haul transmission lines. FERC regulations though demand that these companies open up the remainder of their capacity not used for that purpose to third parties. Twenty-five interstate companies currently operate 172 underground natural gas storage facilities. In 2005, their facilities accounted for about 43 percent of overall storage <b>deliverability</b> and 55 percent of working gas capacity in the US. These operators include the Columbia Gas Transmission Company, Dominion Gas Transmission Company, The National Fuel Gas Supply Company, Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Texas Gas Transmission Company, Southern Star Central Pipeline Company, TransCanada Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, {{it is not surprising that}} this region has the highest level of working gas storage capacity of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis. Although the total capacity for these LNG facilities does not match those of underground storage in scale, the short term high <b>deliverability</b> makes up for that.|$|E
2500|$|The {{measurements}} {{above are}} not fixed {{for a given}} storage facility. For example, <b>deliverability</b> depends on several factors including the amount of gas in the reservoir and the pressure etc. Generally, a storage facility’s <b>deliverability</b> rate varies directly with {{the total amount of}} gas in the reservoir. It is at its highest when the reservoir is full and declines as gas is withdrawn. The injection capacity of a storage facility is also variable and depends on factors similar to those that affect <b>deliverability.</b> The injection rate varies inversely with the total amount of gas in storage. It is at its highest when the reservoir is nearly empty and declines as more gas is injected. The storage facility operator may also change operational parameters. [...] This would allow, for example, the storage capacity maximum to be increased, the withdrawal of base gas during very high demand or reclassifying base gas to working gas if technological advances or engineering procedures allow.|$|E
2500|$|Salt caverns {{are usually}} {{much smaller than}} {{depleted}} gas reservoir and aquifer storage facilities. [...] A salt cavern facility may occupy only one one-hundredth of the area taken up by a depleted gas reservoir facility. Consequently, salt caverns cannot hold the large volumes of gas necessary to meet base load storage requirements. [...] <b>Deliverability</b> from salt caverns is, however, much higher than for either aquifers or depleted reservoirs. This allows the gas stored in a salt cavern to be withdrawn and replenished more readily and quickly. This quick cycle-time is useful in emergency situations or during short periods of unexpected demand surges.|$|E
2500|$|Once a salt {{feature is}} {{discovered}} {{and found to}} be suitable {{for the development of}} a gas storage facility a cavern is created within the salt feature. This is done by the process of solution mining. [...] Fresh water is pumped down a borehole into the salt. [...] Some of the salt is dissolved leaving a void and the water, now saline, is pumped back to the surface. [...] The process continues until the cavern is the desired size. Once created, a salt cavern offers an underground natural gas storage vessel with very high <b>deliverability.</b> Cushion gas requirements are low, typically about 33 percent of total gas capacity.|$|E
2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one should keep in mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a <b>Deliverability</b> basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity. The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity. Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E
