40|$|Thermal {{management}} of electronic products {{relies on the}} effective dissipation of heat. This {{can be achieved by}} the optimisation of the system design with the help of simulation methods. The precision of these models relies also on the used material data. For the determination of this data an experimental set-up for a static measurement is presented, which evaluate thermal conductivity of thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g adhesive, solder, foils, or pastes). It is common practice for high power applications to assemble power devices as bare dies in chip on board technique or to use flip chip assemblies with a directly mounted copper or aluminium heatsink. The thermal resistance of the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> is the bottleneck of the thermal heat flow from the active device junction to the cooler. All the more important is the fact of strongly localised hot spots, as heat spreading requires better thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> as just heat-transfer. If possible, it is useful and common to reduce the thickness of the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material.</b> But for thinner thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> the thermal <b>interface</b> resistance (between the silicon and the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> as well as between the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> and the cooler material) is no longer negligible. Therefore it is essential to account for this effect in the measurement set-up. Common measurement techniques place the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> between two copper plates, heating the plate above and cooling the plate below. In this set-up the heat flow through the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> is supposed to equal the electrical power loss. The thickness of the thermal <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> is some millimetres. This approach does not account for size effects and interface resistances occurring in real set-ups. Therefore a more accurate measurement set-up is constructed and presented. This set-up contains in situ measurement of applied force, the measurement is using interfaces as in real power assembly (same interface resistance) and is universal useable for application of all marketgoing thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials.</b> A range of different <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> is characterised with varying thickness. Thus the thermal conductivity of the <b>materials</b> and the <b>interface</b> resistance is characterised. It is shown that the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> can become a key issue for the thermal {{management of}} dynamically loaded devices. On this example a model with statically determined material data is validated and discussed in simulation and experiment. The paper gives an overview over the set-up and the measurement technique and discusses experimental and simulation results...|$|R

It indicated that the wood dowel after being immersed in CuCl 2 solution for 30  min had a relatively large amount of lignin, probably because acid hydrolysis occurred in hemicellulose and cellulose during the immersing process, causing a relative increase in lignin content. The lower weight loss percent of the wood dowel of the samples pretreated with CuCl 2 in the second stage could also indicate that the content of hemicellulose and cellulose was relatively small. With {{the extension of the}} welded time, the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> of the samples pretreated with CuCl 2 showed a decreasing trend. It indicated that the extension of welded time promoted the pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose, causing a relative reduction in the content of hemicellulose and cellulose in the <b>interface</b> <b>material.</b> The increase in the weight loss percent at the third stage may be caused by a small amount of lignin pyrolysis. Compared with the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> of the untreated group and the pretreatment group at the same welded time, the residual ratio and the third stage weight loss percent were lower in the untreated group than in the pretreatment group. The weight loss percent of the untreated <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> was higher than that of the pretreated <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> at the second stage.

40|$|Heat {{conduction}} {{plays an}} important role in the efficiency and life span of electronic components. To keep electronic components running efficiently and at a proper temperature, thermal management systems transfer heat generated from the components to thermal surfaces such as heat sinks, heat pipes, radiators, or heat spreaders. Thermal surfaces absorb the heat from the electrical components and dissipate it into the environment, preventing overheating. To ensure the best contact between electrical components and thermal surfaces, thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> are applied. In addition to having high conductivity, ideal thermal <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> should be compliant to conform to the components, increasing the surface contact.

30|$|From the DTG curves, {{unlike the}} {{untreated}} group, the wood dowel and welding <b>interface</b> <b>materials</b> of the pretreated group showed two peaks at 310 and 352  °C, respectively. The {{results indicated that}} the acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose was caused by the pretreatment with CuCl 2, and the pyrolysis temperature of the relevant components was early. The peak temperature around 352  °C showed a decreasing trend with the extension of the welded time, and it even disappeared for the pretreated specimens with welded time 7  s. The extension of the welded time led to a greater degree of pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose, as well as the breakage of the long cellulose chain. The peak near 310  °C of CuCl 2 pretreated samples with welded time 3  s was the strongest, the samples with welded time 7  s slightly weaker, and the samples with welded time 5  s the weakest. The peak strength near 310  °C of the samples of welded time 7  s pretreated with CuCl 2 was lower than that of the welded time 3  s group. It showed that the higher degree of hemicellulose and cellulose components pyrolysis during welding for welded time 7 s group. The peak strength near 310  °C of the samples with welded time 7 s pretreated with CuCl 2  was higher than that of welded time 5  s group. Beacuse the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> components of welded time 7  s group were pyrolysis basically in the vicinity of 310  °C, but part of the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> component of welded time 5  s group were pyrolysis in the vicinity of 352  °C. After 390  °C, the pyrolysis rate of pretreated <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> was significantly higher than that of the untreated <b>interface</b> <b>material.</b> This was probably because of the greater degree of hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis in the <b>interface</b> <b>material</b> pretreated with CuCl 2 during the welding process, resulting in a relative increase in lignin content and then the pyrolysis rate increase. It may also result from the role of acid hydrolysis in the impregnation process and the effect of friction tearing during the welding process, which made the lignin more exposed to the pretreated <b>interface</b> <b>material,</b> causing the pyrolysis rate to increase during the TG analysis.|$|R
