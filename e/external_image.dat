25|$|Domestically, the Logan Cup– Zimbabwe's {{first class}} {{competition}} played amongst the provinces– was cancelled in 2006 {{for the first}} time since its inception over a century ago (though the Cup was not played during some of the years of the World Wars). This was widely seen as due to concern by ZC that the standard of play would be so poor as to be both not worthwhile and potentially harmful to the <b>external</b> <b>image</b> of cricket in Zimbabwe. The one-day trophy, the Faithwear Cup, was contested, and drew complaints from observers that the quality was less than club level. As well as player exodus, the main reason for this catastrophic fall in standards was put down to wrangling within Zimbabwe Cricket, where internal politics motivated the removal of the historic provinces and their replacement with revamped, newly designated provincial teams. Zimbabwe's economic collapse led to scanty attendance at games and players not receiving their salaries for long periods of time.|$|E

40|$|This volume {{outlines}} {{a theoretical}} framework bringing together the semiotic concepts developed by Charles Peirce, the sociological insights of Ervin Goffman and the psychoanalytic ideas of Jacques Lacan. Image studies in fashion, advertising, photography, film studies and psychology {{have been influenced by}} these theorists in significant ways. The framework presented helps the reader understand how these ideas relate to the study of different domains of the image: the internal imagery of dreams, <b>external</b> <b>images</b> such as the photograph and image processes which span both contexts, for example, images we have about ourselves. The topics discussed are organized into three themes. The first considers mental imagery, including sound and dreams. The second addresses the interdependent nature of internal and <b>external</b> <b>images,</b> for example, the gendered self and social identity. In the third theme, attention turns to <b>external</b> <b>images</b> including television, film, photography, the computer and the internet. ...|$|R

[18] In {{opinions}} of long continuance, {{and in which}} we have never before been molested by a single doubt, to be suddenly convinced of an error, is almost like being convicted of a fault. There is a state of mind, which is the direct antithesis of that, which takes place when we make a bull. The bull namely consists in the bringing her two incompatible thoughts, with the sensation, but without the sense, of their connection. The psychological condition, or that which constitutes the possibility, of this state, being such disproportionate vividness of two distant thoughts, as extinguishes or obscures the consciousness of the intermediate images or conceptions, or wholly abstracts the attention from them. Thus in the well known bull, [...] "I was a fine child, but they changed me:" [...] the first conception expressed in the word [...] "I," [...] is that of personal identity--Ego contemplans: the second expressed in the word [...] "me," [...] is the visual image or object by which the mind represents to itself its past condition, or rather, its personal identity under the form in which it imagined itself previously to have existed,--Ego contemplatus. Now the change of one visual image for another involves in itself no absurdity, and becomes absurd only by its immediate juxta-position with the fast thought, which is rendered possible by the whole attention being successively absorbed to each singly, so as not to notice the interjacent notion, changed, which by its incongruity, with the first thought, I, constitutes the bull. Add only, that this process is facilitated by the circumstance of the words I, and me, being sometimes equivalent, and sometimes having a distinct meaning; sometimes, namely, signifying the act of self-consciousness, sometimes the <b>external</b> <b>image</b> in and by which the mind represents that act to itself, the result and symbol of its individuality. Now suppose the direct contrary state, and you will have a distinct sense of the connection between two conceptions, without that sensation of such connection which is supplied by habit. The man feels as if he were standing on his head though he cannot but see that he is truly standing on his feet. This, as a painful sensation, will of course have a tendency to associate itself with him who occasions it; even as persons, who have been by painful means restored from derangement, are known to feel an involuntary dislike towards their physician.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{images are}} used in (N= 41) Physics textbooks of three different educational levels. It is discussed {{to what extent the}} use of <b>external</b> <b>images</b> could contribute to the comprehension of the physical phenomena and the building of proper mental representations. It is considered how certain conceptions on the internal images would seem to influence on the way the <b>external</b> <b>images</b> are used. A cla ssification is carried out to get a typology, using multivaried analysis techniques. The results indicate that the level decides the image use, being scarce the interaction with the text. In textbooks for EGB 3 in particular, it is identified a use very linked to the ideas derived from the "picture metaphor". An image use that considers its further internal representation is not identified. These results allow to establish some interesting questions for Teaching and Research in Science Teaching...|$|R
