5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} whale tails {{suffered}} a bit of a backlash. Trinny Woodall, presenter of BBC1's What Not to Wear, described women who wore thongs showing above their trousers as [...] "disgusting". Jessica Kaminsky wrote in I Hate the Gym, a lifestyle commentary, [...] "I hate when girls let their 'whale tails' creep out of their pants." [...] In 2007, religious writer Tamie Bixler Lung wrote, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> when Christian guys and girls want to run around with their underwear hanging out the top of their pants, or their thong strap sticking out the back of their low-rise jeans." [...] In 2008, model and reality TV star Jodie Marsh said, [...] "Showing your thong is a bit old now." ...|$|E
60|$|Clorinda {{stopped short}} suddenly. She had just remembered {{that she would}} not have liked to say that last {{sentence}} to Aunt Emmy. Therefore, there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> about it. Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy. So she stopped to think it over.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bolton {{scowled at}} them, feeling {{certain that they}} were godless persons;--in which she was right. The old banker, drawing his son Daniel out of the room, whispered an inquiry; but Daniel Bolton knew nothing. 'There's <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> as to the sale of that mine,' said the banker. Daniel Bolton thought it {{probable}} that there had <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|R

500|$|Henry tells John and Sherlock {{about the}} words [...] "Liberty" [...] and [...] "In" [...] in his dreams. Sherlock, John, and Henry then visit the hollow {{in the hope}} of finding the hound. On the way, John notices what seems to be Morse code signals (these were unrelated; they were {{headlight}} flashes from a group of doggers). When Sherlock and Henry arrive at the hollow, they both see the hound. At a local inn, Sherlock is visibly shaken and confesses he saw the hound. John tries calming him, suggesting he's imagining things. Sherlock reacts with anger, denying there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with him. John tries to interview Henry's therapist, Louise Mortimer (Sasha Behar). However, they are interrupted by Frankland, who blows his cover. Meanwhile, Henry hallucinates the hound is stalking his home.|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} {{to get them to}} sit at the table properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E
500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences ({{with the exception of}} Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rep. Coutu stated, [...] "... {{the unions}} {{are the first}} ones to say, 'just let us vote' and today, for some reason, they won't let these good people vote and I think there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with that. You can't have it both ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "t {{seems that}} the world is conspiring in preaching that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with Kenyan ladies' kinky hair and dark skin Their {{leaflets}} are all about skin lightening, and they seem to be doing good business in Kenya. It just shocks me. It's not OK for a Caucasian to tell us to lighten our skin [...] I have never attempted to change my skin. I am natural. People in Europe and America love my dark skin. But here in Kenya, in my home country, some consider it not attractive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Visual {{clues to}} the killer's {{identity}} were given throughout the series. In the first episode, Mark Latimer walks along the Broadchurch High Street {{on his way to}} work in the morning. Director Strong asked actors Matthew Gravelle ("Joe Miller") and Adam Wilson ("Tom Miller") to improvise some father-son horseplay. Careful viewers could see Joe with his arm around Tom's neck, [...] "strangling" [...] him. The slug in the Miller household, first seen in episode two, is meant to indicate that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> the Miller family. Joe's visits to the skatepark in episodes three and six indicate not only his link to Danny Latimer but also his desire to be around young boys with whom he could form a relationship similar to the one he had with Danny.|$|E

2500|$|... "We {{look upon}} {{authority}} too often and focus {{over and over}} again, for 30 or 40 or 50 years, as if there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with authority. We see only the oppressive side of authority. Maybe {{it comes out of}} our history and our background. What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. [...] You have free speech so I can be heard." [...] Giuliani in a March 1994 speech on crime at a forum in New York City sponsored by the New York Post as quoted by The New York Times ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Disorders of sex development" [...] (DSD) is a contested term, defined {{to include}} {{congenital}} {{conditions in which}} development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their [...] "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". While it adopted the term, to open [...] "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested {{the adoption of the}} terminology and its implied status as a [...] "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
