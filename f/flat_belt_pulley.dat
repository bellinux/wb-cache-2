2500|$|Two {{generators}} [...] {{were installed}} in the beam engine house after the beam engines were removed and these were driven by the Pollit and Wigzell engine. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> system is still in existence. It is believed that this was used for lighting rather than running the machines.|$|E
50|$|Horse engines {{were used}} to power farm {{implements}} and industrial processes. Examples of machines that were powered with a horse engine include the threshing machine, the corn sheller, pumps and machines for sawing wood. Horse engines were modular in {{that they could be}} attached to whichever implement they were needed for at the time, preventing these machines from needing to incorporate power sources into their design. They could also be used interchangeably with other forms of power, such as a hand crank, line shaft, stationary engine, or the PTO shaft or <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> from a tractor, which eventually replaced them. Today there are modern versions of these being built that have been used with great success to do household chores as well as power a complete Amish-run machine shop in Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|The {{main spindle}} is {{generally}} hollow to allow long bars to extend {{through to the}} work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching workholding devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers {{to reduce the size}} of the tapered hole, and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear. Later machines use a gear box driven by a dedicated electric motor. A fully 'geared head' allows the operator to select suitable speeds entirely through the gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys.</b> The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and <b>pulley</b> wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys</b> which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{engines of}} the late-19th and early-20th centuries ran at speeds {{too low to}} drive a dynamo or {{alternator}} directly. As with other equipment, the generator was driven off the engine's flywheel by a broad <b>flat</b> <b>belt.</b> The <b>pulley</b> on the generator was {{much smaller than the}} flywheel, providing the required 'gearing up' effect. Later spark-ignition engines developed from the 1920s could be directly coupled.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, Vermeer {{introduced}} two new products, {{a portable}} PTO-powered hammermill designed to eliminate <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys</b> and a self-propelled irrigation system that distributes water in large circles over crops. The Vermeer Pow-R Drive met with almost immediate success...thousands were sold. Through these early years, other small farm equipment items, {{such as a}} wagon end-gate seeder and wheel cleaner for row-crop tractors were designed and manufactured.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) was studied, using a novel <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> arrangement which couples the high speed output shaft of an energy storage flywheel to the drive train of an electric vehicle. A specific CVT arrangement was recommended and its components were selected and sized, based on the design requirements of a 1700 KG vehicle. A design layout was prepared and engineering calculations made of component efficiencies and operating life. The transmission efficiency was calculated to be significantly over 90 % with the expected vehicle operation. A design consistent with automotive practice for low future production costs was considered, together with maintainability. The technology advancements required to develop the flat belt CVT were identified and an estimate was made of how {{the size of the}} flat belt CVT scales to larger and smaller design output torques. The suitability of the flat belt CVT for alternate application to an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor without flywheel and to a hybrid electric vehicle powered by an electric motor with an internal combustion engine was studied...|$|E
50|$|While the vaults {{were under}} {{construction}} Bentham was ordering woodworking machinery {{of his own}} design, mostly up-and-down saws and circular saws. These were fitted-up in both ranges, the power to drive them being transmitted from the engines to the north range by underdrives through the upper layer of vaults, and then by vertical shafts to the upper floors of the buildings. The final drives to the machines was by <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> running on <b>pulleys.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> for a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> (which is what <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> on <b>flat</b> <b>pulleys</b> or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The Field-Marshall {{tractors}} were {{commonly used}} to pull agricultural machinery such as threshing machines from site to site. Once in place, the Field-Marshall would {{be used as the}} powerplant for the threshing machine, the tractor's <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> coupled by a large <b>flat</b> drive <b>belt</b> to the threshing machine's pulley.|$|R
40|$|During {{design of}} the {{envelope}} of a noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> one should take into account several conditions resulting from kinematics and geometry of the uneven-running strand transmission. Design of proper values of pitches for a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley,</b> which enable good cooperation between the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> and the <b>belt,</b> should be carefully done. In available Polish literature and catalogues offered by belt manufacturers, one can find only detailed dimensions of belts with a trapezoidal profile. Information on other profiles is insufficient for full description of geometrical features of <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> teeth {{as well as to}} design tools for machining <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys.</b> Manufacturers of <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> and <b>belts</b> give only necessary data to submit a purchase order. The paper presents a digitization process (scanning) of geometry of the envelope of circular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with non-standard profiles; this scanning has been done with the application of coordinate measuring machines. The obtained information on geometrical features of tooth profiles has been numerically analysed. As a result of this analysis, the mathematical description has been obtained. Finally, noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with different tooth profiles have been designed and manufactured...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> {{were widely}} used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in line {{shafting}} to transmit power in factories. They were also used in countless farming, mining, and logging applications, such as bucksaws, sawmills, threshers, silo blowers, conveyors for filling corn cribs or haylofts, balers, water pumps (for wells, mines, or swampy farm fields), and electrical generators. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> are still used today, although {{not nearly as much}} as in the line-shaft era. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds (500 hp at 10,000 ft/min, or 373 kW at 51 m/s), in cases of wide <b>belts</b> and large <b>pulleys.</b> But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> was a U.S.-based {{magazine}} {{dedicated to}} antique farm tractors of all brands and makes. It published successfully for over 2 decades {{and was one}} of the best known titles in the category. It was a family business run first by the Aumann family and then by the Elmore family. In 2009 it was sold, and the new owner eventually changed the name of the publication to Vintage Tractor Digest. This ended its publication under the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> title.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} few issues of the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine, Kurt Aumann wrote nearly all the {{articles}} contained in each issue. If any inclination toward any one brand of tractor or any one antique farm collectors organization could be perceived in the new publication, {{it would be an}} inclination toward the products of the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. This was a reflection of the close relationship that Kurt Aumann had developed with individual members of the Hart-Parr/Oliver Collectors Association. Nonetheless, the magazine sought to cover the history and the technical data of all makes and brands of antique farm tractors and farm equipment. Toward this end, the magazine announced its intention of establishing a network of the reporters from around the nation to contribute articles. [...] Originally, the writers or contributors to <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine were called [...] "Reporters." [...] An early list of Reporters for the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine included Ed Westen of Kewaunee, Wisconsin, Jerry Engstrom of Fargo, North Dakota; Richard LaRusso of New Milford, Connecticut; Robert Oliphant of Waterford, Virginia; David Grube of Ringold, Pennsylvania; and Loran Ellingson of Northwood, North Dakota. [...] In 1989, Kevin Talley of Vermillion, South Dakota and Sam Meeker of North Henderson, Illinois were added as reporters. [...] The reporters attended antique tractor shows across the nation and submitted [...] "show reports" [...] to the magazine on the shows they had attended. Humorous reminiscences from Walter M. Buescher, a retired Allis-Chalmers salesman and manager, were featured in a <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> column for several years.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> was {{standard}} equipment on the WC, while a power take-off (PTO) and a mechanical power lift for the cultivator were optional. In 1936 the PTO option's list price was USD $50, the power lift option's, $35.|$|R
5000|$|Just as the diameters of gears (and, correspondingly, {{their number}} of teeth) {{determine}} {{a gear ratio}} and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver, the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors. [...] and step pulleys (which operate on the same principle, although the names tend {{to be applied to}} <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> versions and V belt versions, respectively) are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed, just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted. V <b>belt</b> step <b>pulleys</b> are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12 was a farm tractor {{produced}} by Allis-Chalmers between 1918 and 1923. Like many other tractors of the era, its model name came from its horsepower ratings, with 6-12 (or 6/12) meaning 6 hp at the drawbar and 12 hp at the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{typically}} belted to the device being {{powered by a}} wide <b>flat</b> <b>belt,</b> typically from 2 - 6 inches (5 - 15 cm) wide. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> is driven by a pulley on the engine that attached either to a flywheel or to the crankshaft. The pulley is specially made in that its circumference is slightly tapered from the middle to each edge (like an over-inflated car tyre) so that {{the middle of the}} pulley is a slightly larger diameter. This design keeps the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> in the centre of the pulley.|$|R

50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the camshaft's timing <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b> These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|R
5000|$|Conditions {{under which}} the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulleys</b> are {{operating}} - The friction between the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulley</b> may decrease substantially if the belt happens to be muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2003, Kurt {{sold his}} {{interest}} in <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine to Chad and Katie Elmore of Jefferson, Wisconsin. The Elmores published the magazine for 6 more years.
