Concurrently, users and vendors of biometric authentication systems are searching for methods to establish system performance.

It consists of two phases. <b>Enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> and verification phase. Both stages start with finger-vein image pre-processing, which includes detection of the region of interest (ROI), image segmentation, alignment, and enhancement.

40|$|Speaker {{recognition}} {{can be used}} as {{a security}} means to authenticate the speaker or as a forensic tool to determine who is likely to be the talker. For such critical applications, robustness or reliability of the system is crucial. In spite of the development and advancement in the field of speaker recognition, there are still many limitations and challenges. Amongst these, environment factors, in particular background noise and reverberation, are known to be difficult to tackle. Environmental noises and reverberation compromise the accuracy of speaker recognition, especially when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) becomes low and reverberation time is long. Noises and reverberation mitigate reliability of speaker recognition systems via signal transmission channel mismatch. This paper is presented from attempts to improve system robustness by adding noises and convoluting room impulse responses in the training phase of typical Gaussian Mixture Model based speaker recognition systems. Validation tests were carried with emulated noisy and reverberant conditions with controlled signal to noise ratios and reverberation times. Two scenarios have been considered the first one used the clean speech samples in <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> and the second included noisy or reverberant samples in <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> thus the potentials and limitations of including noisy and reverberant samples in the training phase to improve system robustness is identified...|$|E

However, the medication is associated with significant haemolytic anaemia, which may require dose reduction, discontinuation or treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin.

40|$|Electronic {{data has}} become the {{standard}} method of storing information in our modern age. Evolving from paper-based data to electronic data creates opportunities to share information between organizations in record speeds, especially when handling large data sets. However, sharing sensitive information creates requirements for electronic data exchange: privacy requires that the original data will not be revealed to unauthorized parties. In the healthcare sector in particular, there are two important use cases that require exchanging information in a privacy-preserving way. 1. Contract research organizations (CROs) need to verify the eligibility of a participant in a phase 1 clinical trial. One criterion is checking that an individual is not concurrently enrolled in a trial at another CRO. However, privacy laws {{and the maintenance of}} a private list of participants for competitive purposes prevent CROs from checking against that criterion. 2. A patient’s medical record is usually distributed amongst several healthcare organizations. To improve healthcare services, {{it is important to have}} a patient’s complete medical history: either to help diagnose an illness or to gather statistics for better disease control. However, patient medical files need to be confidential. Two healthcare organizations cannot link their large patient databases by disclosing identity revealing details (e. g., names or health card numbers). This thesis presents the development and evaluation of protocols capable of querying and linking datasets in a privacy-preserving manner: TRACK for checking concurrent <b>enrolment</b> in <b>phase</b> 1 clinical trials, and SHARE for linking two large datasets in terms of millions of (patient medical) records. These protocols are better than existing approaches in terms of the privacy protection level they offer (e. g., against dictionary and frequency attacks), of the reliance on trusted third parties, and of performance when performing blocking. These protocols were extensively validated in simulated scenarios similar to their real-world counterparts. The thesis presents novel identity representation schemes that offer strong privacy measures while being efficient for very large databases. These schemes may be used by other researchers to represent identity in different use cases. CROs may implement the protocols (and especially TRACK) in systems to check if an individual exists in another CRO’s dataset without revealing the identity of that individual. Two healthcare organizations may use a system based on this research (and especially the SHARE protocol) to discover their common patients while protecting the identities of the other patients...|$|R

The recognition is done by using methods of fingerprint matching. Matching methods can be of two types-verification of fingerprint and {{identification of}} fingerprint. Combination of fingerprint for protecting privacy is a system for guarding fingerprint isolation by integrating two distinct fingerprints into new indirect identity. Fingerprints are taken from FVC databases. In the <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> two fingerprints will be taken from two distinct fingers.

From the information taken out an impression of combined minutiae is generated and deposited in the database. In authentication phase system requires two fingerprints from similar two fingers which were used previously during enrolment time. A minutia cylinder code matching algorithm is recommended for matching the two fingerprints query against template of combined minutiae. By keeping combined minutiae template, full attributes of single fingerprint will not be recognized even if the database is grabbed. As there is likeness in topology {{it is not possible}} for raider to draw out a template of combined minutiae from actual templates of minutiae.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{concerns}} {{the implementation of}} our online signature verification system on a mobile device. Verification involves confirming or denying a person's claimed identity. Our system {{is based on a}} Hidden Markov Model and outputs two complementary scores: the first one is related to the likelihood given by the HMM of the claimed identity; the second one is related to the segmentation given by such an HMM on the input signature. A claimed identity is confirmed when the arithmetic mean of the two scores obtained on such an input signature is higher than a threshold. Also, a personal normalization of the local parameters of the signature is carried out to make the system robust to changes of platforms. A patent was submitted with special emphasis on the latter claim. This system is implemented on a mobile platform PDA Qtek 2020 ARM 400 MHz. An acquisition interface is developed allowing an enrollment step of a person by acquisition of 5 of his/her signatures, and a verification step of a given signature of a registered person. Enrolment speed depends on the complexity of the signature, while verification is performed in real time. Performance assessment of our system, carried out on two databases acquired on a PDA, shows a degradation of system performance on mobile platform compared to a fixed platform. In order to improve the performance in the case of mobility, we propose a strategy for enhancing the quality of the reference signatures at the <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|E

These developments involved: Good formalisation of the theoretical background, including hidden Markov model (HMM) inference, parameter adaptation, scoring and decision threshold. Implementation of the automatic hidden Markov model (HMM) inference system, using local phonetic probabilities generated at the output of a speaker-independent articial neural network (ANN).

Collegial revision of an archival test cohort of colorectal cancer samples led to specific recommendations for adapting current breast and gastric cancer criteria for scoring ERBB 2 in colorectal cancer. In step 2, from September 2012 to January 2015, colorectal-specific ERBB 2 testing protocols and ERBB 2 scoring criteria were used to centrally screen for ERBB 2 -positive KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients to be enrolled in the HERACLES trial (clinical validation cohort).

40|$|Person re-identification from facial captures {{remains a}} {{challenging}} problem in video surveillance, {{in large part}} due to variations in capture conditions over time. The facial model of a target individual is typically designed during an <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> using {{a limited number of}} reference samples, and may be adapted as new reference videos become available. However incremental learning of classifiers in changing capture conditions may lead to knowledge corruption. This paper presents an active framework for an adaptive multi-classifier system for video-to-video face recognition in changing surveillance environments. To estimate a facial model during the enrolment of an individual, facial captures extracted from a reference video are employed to train an individual-specific incremental classifier. To sustain a high level of performance over time, a facial model is adapted in response to new reference videos according the type of concept change. If the system detects that the facial captures of an individual incorporate a gradual pattern of change, the corresponding classifier(s) are adapted through incremental learning. In contrast, to avoid knowledge corruption, if an abrupt pattern of change is detected, a new classifier is trained on the new video data, and combined with the individual’s previously-trained classifiers. For validation, a specific implementation is proposed, with ARTMAP classifiers updated using an incremental learning strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization, and the Hellinger Drift Detection Method is used for change detection.

Because there are few data on UFC variability in patients with active Cushing's disease, we analysed baseline UFC in a large patient cohort with moderate-to-severe Cushing's disease and assessed whether variability correlates with hypercortisolism severity. These data will help clinicians establish the minimum number of UFC samples required to obtain reliable data. Design Observational study (<b>enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> of Phase III study). Methods Patients (n = 152) with persistent/recurrent or de novo Cushing's disease and mean UFC (mUFC) ≥ 1 · 5 ×ULN (normal: 30 - 145 nmol/ 24 h) were included. Mean UFC level was calculated from four 24 -h urine samples collected over 2 weeks. Results Over 600 24 -h UFC samples were analysed. The mUFC levels of samples 1 and 2 and samples 3 and 4 were 1000 nmol/ 24 h (SD 1872) and 940 nmol/ 24 h (SD 2148), respectively; intrapatient coefficient of variation (CV) was 38 % for mUFC. The intrapatient CV using all four samples was 52 % (95 % CI: 48 - 56). The intrapatient CV was 51 % (95 % CI: 44 - 58) for samples 1 and 2, 49 % (95 % CI: 43 - 56) for samples 3 and 4 and 54 % (95 % CI: 49 - 59) for samples 1, 2 and 3. Variability in mUFC increased as UFC levels increased. There were no correlations between UFC and clinical features of hypercortisolism. Conclusions There is intrapatient variability of approximately 50 % in 24 -h UFC measurements, which is relevant to targets set to estimate any treatment effect. Analysing more than two 24 -h collection periods in individual patients does not result in a relevant decrease in variability.

Phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 i) improve NO levels. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate whether long-term, chronic treatment with the PDE 5 i Vardenafil improves systemic endothelial function in diabetic men. DESIGN: Prospective, investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical-trial. METHODS: 54 male patients affected by T 2 DM, diagnosed within the last 5 years, and erectile dysfunction were enrolled, regardless of testosterone (T) levels. 26 and 28 patients were assigned to verum and placebo-group, respectively. The study consisted of an <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> a treatment phase (24 weeks) (Vardenafil/placebo 10 mg twice-daily), and a follow-up phase (24 weeks). Parameters evaluated: International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) - 15, flow mediated dilation (FMD), serum interleukin (IL) - 6, endothelin (ET) - 1, gonadotropins and T (measured by liquid-chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry). RESULTS: IIEF- 15 erectile function improved during treatment (p< 0. 001). At the end of the treatment both FMD (p= 0. 040) and IL- 6 (p= 0. 019) significantly improved. FMD correlated with serum T levels (R 2 = 0. 299, p< 0. 001).

Additionally, women with an HPV positive result were given a cytological examination and if the cytological diagnosis was ASC-US or more severe, only women with HPV HR, were referred for colposcopy. Results We present here data for the <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> of the study. At baseline, within the study sample, just under 30 % of women were infected by HPV and 19. 3 % of women were infected with oncogenic types. A relationship was highlighted between HPV infection, number of sexual partners (in particularly in the last 3 years) and the lifetime number of partner's partners. Condom use showed a slight protective effect in univariate analysis but these data were not statistically significant in multivariate analysis. The association between HPV infection and demographic and behavioural variables were tested by crude odds ratio (OR). Multivariate logistic regression was applied to compute the adjusted odds ratios. Conclusions The prevalence of oncogenic HPV types was high in young Tuscan women. The 3 -year follow-up of this cohort may provide {{a better understanding of the}} processes of acquisition, clearance and persistence of infection and the correlated risk factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Danish case {{of organic}} {{agriculture}} is {{generally regarded as}} a success story. But the enrolment of new actors and the growing economic interest {{may lead to a}} change of the ideological foundation of organic agriculture. The scope {{of this paper is to}} explore what happens to organic agriculture through the process of dissemination of the organic mode of farming and enrolment of conventional farmers into organic farming from an Actor Network Theory (ANT) approach. This is explored through an in-depth case study of the local development and dissemination processes of organic farming. 11 organic farmers and two local advisors were interviewed. The narratives of the local organic network give the outlines to three phases in the network building. 1) The pioneer phase dominated by actors that is not belonging to the mainstreams of agriculture. 2) The <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> where local conventional actors are mobilised into the organic network. 3) The disconnection phase, where new organic farmers no longer necessarily are enrolled in the organic network and where the conventional agricultural networks have adopted organic farming as a concept into the conventional network strategies. The ocular of ANT provides a new insight in the development of organic farming - useful to both the organic actors and to non-organic actors enrolled and enrolling into the organic mode of farming. Viewed from an ANT perspective, organic farming is not only a certain mode of farming, defined by rules, certification, brand, and control, but a mode of farming interwoven in a dynamic network of ideas, values, nature, human, food, technology, knowledge, etc., co- and reproducing the values and modes of farming. Enrolling of external actors is crucial to the strategy of the organic network. The enrolling capacity of the network is closely linked to the cohesiveness and internal resources of the network. In the long run, only strong networks are attractive to external actors and therefore the disconnection is a threat and a challenge to the future development and reproduction of the organic movement...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Ethiopian {{epidemic}} {{is currently on}} the wane. However, the situation for infected children {{is in some ways}} lagging behind due to low treatment coverage and deficient prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Too few studies have examined HIV infected children presenting to care in low-income countries in general. Considering the presence of local variations {{in the nature of the}} epidemic a study in Ethiopia could be of special value for the continuing fight against HIV. The aim of this study is to describe the main characteristics of children with HIV presenting to care at a district hospital in a resource-limited area in southern Ethiopia. The aim was also to analyse factors affecting pre-ART loss to follow-up, time to ART-initiation and disease stage upon presentation. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. The data analysed were collected in 2009 for the period January 2003 through December 2008 at Arba Minch Hospital and additional data on the ART-need in the region were obtained from official reports. Results: The pre-ART loss to follow-up rate was 29. 7 %. Older children (10 – 14 years) presented in a later stage of their disease than younger children (76. 9 % vs. 45. 0 % in 0 – 4 year olds, chi-square test, χ 2 = 8. 8, P = 0. 01). Older girls presented later than boys (100. 0 % vs. 57. 1 %, Fisher’s exact test, P = 0. 02). Children aged 0 – 4 years were more likely to be lost to follow-up (40. 0 vs. 21. 8 %, chi-square test, χ 2 = 5. 4, P = 0. 02) and had a longer time to initiate ART (Cox regression analysis, HR: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 25 - 0. 97, P = 0. 04, controlling for sex, place of residence, <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase</b> and WHO clinical stage upon presentation). Neither sex was overrepresented in the sample. Tuberculosis prevalence upon presentation and previous history of tubercolosis were 14. 5 % and 8 % respectively. Conclusions: The loss to follow-up is alarmingly high and children present too late. Further research is needed to explore specific causes and possible solutions. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of “organic farming” {{is a topic}} of great attention as a measure to environmental regulation, high value food production, etc. and the Danish case of organic agriculture is generally regarded as a success story. The prevailing strategy of the Danish organic movement has been to mobilise non-organic actors in the {{dissemination of}} the ‘organic mode of farming’. A strategy that is embedded in a dogmatic belief that the ‘internal conversion’ in terms of values, ideas and thinking almost automatically will follow the ‘external conversion’ into the ‘organic mode’ of farming according to the rules. In this paper farmers’ network-strategy to disseminate organic farming is explored through a longitudinal case study within a local area with a high density of organic farmers. Through farmers narratives it is explored how farmers were mobilised into the network, how they contributed to mobilise conventional farmers, advisors and other actors into the network of organic farming, and finally if the dogma of symmetry between the external and internal conversion can be sustained or not. Three phases of network-building was revealed: 1) the pioneer phase dominated by actors that is not belonging to the mainstreams of agriculture, 2) the <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> where local conventional actors are mobilised into the organic network, and. 3) the non-connection phase, where farmers converting to the organic mode of farming no longer necessarily are enrolled in the organic network and where the conventional agricultural networks have adopted organic farming as a concept into the conventional network strategies. The farmers’ narratives partly confirm the dogma of coherence between the external and internal conversion process, but reject any mechanistic {{connection between the two}} processes, and add to a much more complex sociological under standing of these conversion processes. The push and pull into organic networks, due to the facing of social and technical risk, may be stronger explanation of the internal conversion process than the technical changes in the farming practice. In the non-connection phase there are no forces of pull and push of the farmers into the social and technical network relations of organic farming. The revealed scenario is that the non-connected conventional actors will, in numbers, dominate organic farming but not contribute to reproduce organic farming as an alternative development of agriculture. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Steroidogenesis is {{a complex}} enzymatic pro- cess in which cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) play an important role. Phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors(PDE 5 i) increase cGMP, improving NO availability. Objective. To investigate whether long-term, chronic treat- ment with the PDE 5 i Vardenafil affects adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis in diabetic men, using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Design. A longitudinal, prospective, investigator-started, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical-trial was carried out. Setting and participants. 54 male patients affected by T 2 DM diagnosed within the last 5 years were enrolled. 26 and 28 patients {{were assigned to the}} verum and placebo-group, re- spectively. Interventions. The study consisted of an <b>enrolment</b> <b>phase,</b> a treatment phase (24 weeks) (Vardenafil/placebo 10 mg twice- daily), and a follow-up phase (24 weeks). Outcome measurements. Progesterone (P), 17 -hydroxy- progesterone (17 OHP), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), corticosterone, 11 -deoxycortisol and cortisol (C), were evalu- ated using LC-MS/MS. Results. No differences were seen in sex testicular steroids between study and control group. For the adrenal gland, steroids were considered according to the zona in which they are pro- duced. Considering steroids produced in the zona fasciculata, no significant differences were seen in 11 -deoxycortisol and C among visits, both in the study and in the control group. For the zona reticularis, DHEA significantly decreased during treatment only in the study group (p= 0. 007). At post-hoc test DHEA showed higher levels at visit 2 and 8 than in other visits. The DHEAS/DHEAS ratio significantly increased during treatment only in the verum group. Considering the adrenal zona glomeru- losa, corticosterone significantly changed among visits both in the study and in the control group (p< 0. 001). At post-hoc test, in ПРОБЛЕМЫ ЭНДОКРИНОЛОГИИ, 5, 2016 both groups, corticosterone was significantly higher at visit 2 (p= 0. 028), 8 (p= 0. 003) and 10 (p= 0. 044), i. e. in coincidence with the complete clinical and instrumental examination per- formed only at these visits according to the study protocol. Conclusions. This is the first double-blind, placebo-con- trolled clinical-trial in which steroidogenesis is extensively in- vestigated by LC-MS/MS in T 2 DM men chronically treated with Vardenafil for 6 months, and followed-up for 6 months after therapy-withdrawal. Chronically administered Vardenafil reduces DHEA levels and increases DHEAS/DHEA ratio as possible consequences of modulation of steroidogenic enzymes by tissue changes in cGMP and/or cAMP availability. A possi- bly stress-related increase in corticosterone is suggested for the first time...|$|E
40|$|This journal suppl. is Abstract Book of The International Liver Congress™ 2011 Poster SessionBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Foretinib is an oral multikinase {{inhibitor}} targeting MET, RON, AXL, TIE- 2 and VEGFR. HGF/MET signaling plays {{a pivotal}} role in tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and circulating levels of HGF correlate with poor prognosis in HCC. This phase I/II trial (MET 111645) is evaluating oral foretinib as first line therapy in advanced Asian HCC patients. METHODS: Patients with measurable unresectable/metastatic HCC, no prior sorafenib or other multi-kinase inhibitors, ECOG PS 0 – 1, adequate organ function and Child–Pugh grade A are eligible for <b>enrolment.</b> <b>Phase</b> I is a standard 3 + 3 design using increasing doses of oral foretinib to evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives include antitumour activity and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: As of November 16, 2010, 13 patients have been enrolled: median age 57 years (range 31 – 78 years), M/F = 9 / 4. BCLC stage 0 /A/B/C at screening: 0 / 0 / 3 / 10. Prior lines of therapy including local treatment: unknown/ 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 : 1 / 3 / 5 / 2 / 1. Drug-related adverse events (AE) were reported in 10 patients (77 %). The most common AEs were hypertension (54 %), diarrhoea (31 %), thrombocytopenia (23 %), and peripheral oedema (23 %). Serious treatment-emergent toxicities were reported in 54 % of patients. Two dose-limiting toxicities (renal failure, proteinuria) were observed in 2 / 6 patients at 45 mg OD but no DLTs were observed in 6 patients at 30 mg OD. Nine patients were evaluable for response according to RECIST 1. 0; 2 patients had a best response of partial response (PR); objective response rate (ORR) 22 %. When tumour response was assessed according to modified RECIST criteria for HCC, 1 patient showed a complete response and 3 patients had a PR; ORR 44 %. Exposure of 30 - and 45 -mg OD foretinib was overlapping and similar to higher doses in other tumour types. CONCLUSION: The foretinib MTD was determined to be 30 mg OD. The early promising signal of activity observed in this phase I trial needs to be confirmed in phase II.
