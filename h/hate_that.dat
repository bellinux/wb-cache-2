His comments on issues and events were being widely reported in print, on radio, and on television, and he was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, The <b>Hate</b> <b>That</b> Hate Produced.|$|E

Ghokle then reveals Jai Dev's illegal activities to Bhardwaj, after which he is killed by Jai Dev. After the meeting, Surya comes to know that Jai Dev is planning to kill Bhardwaj and Chitra. He reaches Chitra's house and saves her but fails to save Bhardwaj. Chitra is devastated and Surya reveals to her that he was an American-born Indian who lost his philanthropist NRI father and mother at an early age; they were cheated and killed by Jai Dev. This incident and the peoples' attitudes towards orphans while growing up made him <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> society.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on terrorism is tunnel vision at its worst. It is not just <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> motivates such acts, but ideology. One needn't be a bona fide member of an Islamic terrorist group to share their outlook.|$|E
25|$|The {{treaties}} of 1815 stirred him up up {{like some}} personal offence. He hated Wellington with a straightforward <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> pleased the masses; and for seventeen years, scarcely {{paying any attention}} to intermediate events, he had magnificently maintained his sadness over Waterloo. In his death throes, at his final hour, he had hugged to his breast a sword that the officers of the Hundred Days had presented to him. Napoleon died uttering the word armée, Lamarque uttering the word patrie – homeland.|$|E
25|$|Wallace Fard {{founded the}} Nation of Islam in the 1930s. Under his wing Wallace took Elijah (Poole) Muhammad, as his student and {{who later became}} {{the leader of the}} organization. The basis of the group was the belief held that Christianity was a {{religion}} that was exclusively a White man's religion, while Islam was the way for black folk; Christianity was a religion like slavery that was forced upon the people who suffered {{at the hands of the}} whites during their enslavement. The beliefs of the members of the Nation of Islam are that alike to those who follow the Koran and worship Allah under the religion of Islam. The Nation of Islam, having a foundation based on a resentment of the way Whites historically treated people of color, the group itself embraces the ideas of Black Nationalism. The group itself has since the leadership of Elijah recruited thousands of followers from all parts (prisons, and those following movements of Black pride and Nationalism). They preached that integration (into White American culture) was not the goal, but instead to unite and create their own footprint and create their own separate community and obliterate oppression. Their aim was to have their own schools, churches and support each other without any reliance on other racial groups. The members of the Nation of Islam are known as “Black Muslims”. As the group became more and more supported with public speakers and figures such as Malcolm X as their orator and so did the attention it received from others outside. In 1959 the group was revealed in a documentary named “The <b>Hate</b> <b>that</b> Hate Produced”. The document shone the organization in a negative light depicting it as a black supremacy group. Even with such depiction the group did not lose support from its people. When Elijah Muhammad died his son took on the role as the leader of the Nation of Islam, converting the group into a more orthodox representation of the word of Islam, and abandoning its tendencies of violence through its beliefs. This conversion led to others to abandon the group unsatisfied with the change in ideology created a “New” Nation of Islam to reignite the flame that the group originally aimed for.|$|E

Darling" [...] by The Beatles (from their album Abbey Road) and to [...] "Scream it like you <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> bitch!" [...] Thompson's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced verses followed by thundering chorus lines and repetitive guitar staccato.|$|E
500|$|The G {{suffers from}} a wide range of issues that has {{resulted}} in complaints by people living along the route. Historically, it has only connected Brooklyn and Queens, resulting in many people thinking of the G as the subway system's [...] "outcast" [...] and the [...] "unwanted drunk uncle everyone has." [...] One reporter wrote of the G, [...] " [...] need it because it goes where no other train does, but they <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> they need it." [...] Compounding to the G [...] "outcast" [...] reputation, some of the G stations along the Crosstown Line are in bad shape. Since 2001, however, a series of service cuts and missing connections to other lines has worsened public opinion of the G.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that I would say that {{and the way that}} I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E

500|$|West's {{performance}} on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as [...] "we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all / I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall." [...] Swizz Beatz sets {{the tone of the}} song using several ad-libs such as [...] "one hand in the air, if you don't really care" [...] and the line [...] "this shit is fucking ridiculous" [...] which is repeated several times throughout the song, delivered by nearly every rapper. The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
500|$|In a subplot, Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{drops off}} a {{temporary}} liquor license renewal at the Snakehole Lounge nightclub, where the owner Freddy (Andy Milder) tells him {{they are seeking}} investors who can buy a share for $10,000. Although {{he does not have}} the money, Tom reveals part-ownership in a nightclub is a longtime dream of his, so he seeks assistance from his fast-talking friend, Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), who contributes $5,000. Tom has $4,000 of his own but still needs $1,000, so he seeks further help from his co-workers. Donna (Retta) expresses an interest, but decides against it when she meets Jean-Ralphio, of whom she immediately declares, [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> guy." [...] Meanwhile, when Andy's (Chris Pratt) band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson) tells Andy he can no longer live with him, April (Aubrey Plaza) helps Andy look for an apartment. They find one near her house, prompting a smitten April to note that they can carpool to work together. But when Andy learns Tom needs $1,000, he forgoes the apartment to give Tom the money as a gift. April is surprised by the choice and disappointed with the result. In the episode's final scene, Tom is shown enjoying his nightclub part ownership, until he learns Donna has bought three shares herself.|$|E
500|$|The songs [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent", [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] (probably a {{reference}} to Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same title A Farewell to Arms, which is set during the first World War), and [...] "Halo" [...] deal with politics, the war in Iraq and organized religion, respectively. The band wrote the lyrics about the Iraq war after conducting research and found that [...] "a lot of stuff does not add up", according to Flynn, which angered the band. Machine Head's debut album, Burn My Eyes, featured a similar song titled [...] "A Thousand Lies" [...] which dealt with the Gulf War. [...] "Slanderous" [...] deals with <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> still exists throughout society and [...] "Wolves" [...] addresses the band's competitive [...] "winner takes all" [...] spirit. [...] "Now I Lay Thee Down" [...] features a Romeo and Juliet-esque love story about one person killing another person, and then killing themself. The song relates to the William Shakespeare play, Romeo & Juliet, where {{at the end of}} the story, two lovers kill themselves because they assume that their lover is dead. The original lyrics to the chorus of the song were considered [...] "poppy" [...] by Flynn and his band-mates so they intentionally changed them into the lyrics they are now so they wouldn't get radio play.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{backstage}} drama {{portrayed in}} the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage {{about the same time}} she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health {{as a result of her}} diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: [...] "I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love." [...] The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> show." [...] According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success.|$|E
500|$|In its DVD Reviews section, EWs Chris Nashawaty {{gave the}} film an A-minus, stating, [...] "Depp's soaring voice {{makes you wonder}} what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's {{hard not to be}} {{reminded}} of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [...] never met." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded it 3½ out of 4 stars and added, [...] "Sweeney Todd is a thriller-diller from start to finish: scary, monstrously funny and melodically thrilling... is a bloody wonder, intimate and epic, horrific and heart-rending as it flies on the wings of Sondheim's most thunderously exciting score." [...] As with Time, the critic ranked it fifth on his list of the best movies of 2007. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The blood juxtaposed to the music is highly unsettling. It runs contrary to expectations. Burton pushes this gore into his audiences' faces so as to feel the madness and the destructive fury of Sweeney's obsession. Teaming with Depp, his long-time alter ego, Burton makes Sweeney a smoldering dark pit of fury and <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> consumes itself. With his sturdy acting and surprisingly good voice, Depp is a Sweeney Todd for the ages." [...] Harry Knowles gave the film a highly positive review, calling it Burton's best film since Ed Wood, his favorite Burton film, and said it was possibly superior. He praised all of the cast and the cinematography, but noted it would probably not appeal to non-musical fans due to the dominance of music in the film.|$|E

500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all it did was get me picked on. I fucking <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting. [...] "Kill You" [...] is about Davis' ex-stepmother. Davis explained: ...|$|E
