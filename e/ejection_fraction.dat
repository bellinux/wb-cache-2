5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an <b>ejection</b> <b>fraction,</b> which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. <b>Ejection</b> <b>fraction</b> can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved <b>ejection</b> <b>fraction,</b> treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved <b>ejection</b> <b>fraction.</b> The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cardiac {{fatty acid}} uptake occurs {{predominantly}} via sarcolemmal transporter proteins; fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD 36), plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm) and fatty acid transporter proteins (FATP) 1 and 6. We hypothesised that {{levels of the}} fatty acid transporters would be reduced in the chronically infarcted rat heart, in parallel with reduced dependence on fatty acid utilisation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vivo left ventricular <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions,</b> measured using echocardiography, were 36 % lower in rats six months after coronary artery ligation than in sham-operated control rats. In isolated, perfused, infarcted hearts, 3 H-palmitate oxidation was 30 % lower, and correlated with in vivo <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions.</b> As myocardial lipid incorporation was also reduced by 25 %, total palmitate utilisation was 29 % lower in the infarcted rat heart. The protein levels of the cardiac fatty acid transporters were reduced in the infarcted rat heart; FAT/CD 36 by 36 %, FABPpm by 12 %, FATP 6 by 21 % and FATP 1 by 26 %, and the cytosolic fatty acid binding protein (cFABP) was 47 % lower than in sham-operated rat hearts. Fatty acid transporter levels correlated with both palmitate oxidation rates and cardiac <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in fatty acid oxidation and lipid incorporation rates were accompanied by downregulation of the cardiac fatty acid transporters.

Recurrence of significant angina within 6 to 12 months affected 30 patients (38 %) in group A compared to 12 (24 %) in group B (p> 0. 05). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 42 patients (53 %) in group A compared to 14 (28 %) in group B (p = 0. 006). Restenosis after single-vessel angioplasty was 46 % in group A and 25 % in group B (p> 0. 05), after multivessel angioplasty it was 62 % in group A and 33 % in group B (p = 0. 05).

25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the stroke {{volume of the}} left {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart.

The goal of this project {{was to determine if}} the QGS LVEF varies with the change in end-diastolic left ventricular volume (EDV) and in particular to verify that the clinically observed phenom-enon of falsely elevated QGS LVEF in patients with small hearts is actually occurring. Methods: A series of mathematically de-fined left ventricles (LVs) was produced by varying the EDV and targeted LVEF (tLVEF). These were created using concentric hemiellipsoids with nine different EDVs. The tLVEF was varied from 15 % to 75 % by 5 % increments for a total of 13 different <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions.</b> These datasets were then smoothed, creat-ing a total of 234 sets. The smoothed and unsmoothed images were then processed using QGS software. The LVEFs and EDVs were recorded. Results: For lower LVEFs the agreement be-tween the QGS LVEF and the tLVEF is good. A marked over-estimation occurs when the EDVs are low and the <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions</b> are in the higher range. This effect is greater in the smoothed images. Conclusion: An artifactual increase in the LVEF can occur when measurements are made with the QGS software. These data argue against using QGS LVEF for moni-toring the LVEF in patients with small hearts. Our data imply that a mildly decreased LVEF may still appear to be in the normal range when measured by QGS software.

Resting <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions</b> and qualitative assessment of left ventricular angiographic contraction abnormalities were also determined. Changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure following afterload interventions could be linearly related to changes in mean aortic pressure, but mitral valve gradients were unaffected.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of long-term right ventricular pacing on left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony in children and young adults with congenital and acquired heart block. Eighteen patients aged 19 Â± 7 years with congenital heart block (group I), 9 aged 21 Â± 11 years with acquired heart block after congenital heart surgery (group II), and 15 healthy control subjects (group III) were studied. The LV volumes, <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions,</b> and systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI) values, as determined using 3 -dimensional echocardiography, were compared among groups. Groups I (6. 68 Â± 2. 44 %) and II (9. 43 Â± 4. 44 %) had significantly greater SDI values than group III (3. 88 Â± 0. 63 %) (p = 0. 011 and p 5. 14 %, mean + 2 SDs of controls) in groups I and II was 72 % and 67 %, respectively. In 27 patients with right ventricular pacing, LV SDI values were correlated negatively with the LV <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions</b> (r = - 0. 74, p < 0. 001). The times to minimum regional volume were significantly longer in lateral, posterior, and inferior segments in group I and septal and inferior segments in group II compared to those in group III (p < 0. 05). Compared to patients without LV dyssynchrony, patients with LV dyssynchrony had lower LV <b>ejection</b> <b>fractions</b> (p < 0. 001), had shorter RR intervals (p < 0. 001), and tended to have dual-chamber pacing (p = 0. 088) but had similar durations of pacing, QRS durations, and positions of pacing wires (epicardial vs endocardial). In conclusion, permanent right ventricular pacing in childhood has a negative effect on LV systolic function through the induction of mechanical dyssynchrony, the magnitude and pattern of which differ between congenital and acquired heart block.
