25|$|Pyridine is <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> inhaled, <b>swallowed</b> or absorbed {{through the}} skin. Effects of acute {{pyridine}} intoxication include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, {{and loss of}} appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. One person died after accidental ingestion of {{half a cup of}} pyridine. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500mg·kg−1. In high doses, pyridine has a narcotic effect and its vapor concentrations of above 3600ppm pose a health risk. The oral LD50 in rats is 891mg·kg−1. Pyridine is flammable.|$|R
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} a toothbrush as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> accidentally <b>swallowed</b> in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{chemical}} spill of 4 -Methylcyclohexanemethanol (4 -MCHM) in West Virginia left 300, 000 {{people without}} water. Officials claimed that this compound is not lethally toxic, but potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> <b>swallowed</b> or inhaled, {{and can cause}} eye and skin irritation. Sittig's Handbook of Toxic and Hazardous Chemical Carcinogens reports high exposures from skin contact or inhalation may cause damage to the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs, and may result in death. However, no quantitative data seem to exist and no references {{can be found on}} neurotoxicity. We have investigated the neurotoxicity of 4 -MCHM using mammalian nerve cell networks grown on microelectrode arrays. Network spontaneous activity from multiple units (range 48 – 120 per network) were used as the primary readout. Individual units were followed based on spike waveforms digitized at 40 kHz (Plexon MNAP system). Dose response curves show the effective inhibitory concentration at 50 percent decrease (EC 50) to average 27. 4 microM SD± 6. 17. However, in the presence of 40 microM bicuculline, a competitive GABAA antagonist, the EC 50 shifts to 70. 63 uM SD ± 4. 3; implying that early, low concentration exposures to 4 -MCHM involve GABA activation. Initial activity loss occurs without active unit loss (defined as 10 or more template threshold crossing per min), indicating functional interference with spike production. Full recovery has not been seen at concentrations above 130 microM, unless the culture was given bicuculline. Direct exposure to 400 uM results in immediate, irreversible loss of spike production, followed by necrosis of glia and neurons...|$|R
50|$|Edible printer inks {{have now}} become {{prevalent}} and are {{used in conjunction with}} special ink printers. Ink that is not specifically marketed as being edible may be <b>harmful</b> or fatal <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Edible toner for laser printers is not currently available. Any inkjet or bubblejet printer can be used to print, although resolution may be poor, and care should be taken to avoid contaminating the edible inks with previously used inks. Inkjet or bubblejet printers can be converted to print using edible ink, and cartridges of edible ink are commercially available.|$|R
50|$|Charcoal {{lighter fluid}} is a {{volatile}} fluid used {{to accelerate the}} ignition of charcoal in a barbecue grill. It can either be petroleum based (e.g., mineral spirits) or alcohol based (usually methanol or ethanol). It can be used both with lump charcoal and briquettes. Lighter-fluid infused briquettes, that {{eliminate the need for}} separate application of lighter fluid, are available. The use of lighter fluid is somewhat controversial as the substance is combustible, <b>harmful</b> or fatal <b>if</b> <b>swallowed,</b> and may impart an unpleasant flavor to food cooked upon fires lit with it. A traditional alternative to using lighter fluid is a chimney starter.|$|R

2500|$|Batteries may be <b>harmful</b> or fatal <b>if</b> <b>swallowed.</b> Small {{button cells}} can be swallowed, in {{particular}} by young children. While in the digestive tract, the battery's electrical discharge {{may lead to}} tissue damage; such damage is occasionally serious {{and can lead to}} death. Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus {{is a function of the}} patient's age and battery size. Disk batteries of 16mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year. [...] Older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 21–23mm. Liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery (usually at the anode). Perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion.|$|R
