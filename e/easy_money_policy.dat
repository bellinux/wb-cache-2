50|$|An <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> is a {{monetary}} policy {{that increases the}} money supply usually by lowering interest rates. It occurs when a countrys central bank decides to allow new cash flows into the banking system. Since interest rates are lower, {{it is easier for}} banks and lenders to loan money, thus leading to increased economic growth.|$|E
40|$|Does Minsky's theory explain recent market instability? For {{financial}} fragility, Minsky argued, specific preconditions must occur. These preconditions {{have not}} occurred, therefore recent financial market instability {{is not a}} Minsky moment. Instead the recent financial market instability is due to an insolvency problem of large underwriters caused by their attempt to "securitize" (make liquid) noncommercial mortgages (where the latter are normally illiquid assets). The solution for such an insolvency problem is large direct infusions of new capital in these institutions or removing nonperforming loans from their books.

40|$|Financial innovation, the {{deficiencies}} of corporate governance, moral hazard, <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policies,</b> government inefficiency, and mainly {{the activity of}} the shadow banking system have all {{played a critical role in}} setting off the global financial crisis. 	Due to the imbalances it has triggered, the shadow banking system has been at the core of the most widespread and profound world crisis of all time, as the attempt to use financial capital as efficiently as possible by resorting to “innovative” products has significantly contributed to the advent of the financial crisis. 	The present crisis has already proved that the banking and financial activity can have a deeply disturbing impact on our economy, but the flexibility of lending mechanisms and the various reactions of the players on the market that are otherwise inherent in a dynamic economic system, cannot exist in the absence of banking mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{many economists}} have {{credited}} the late- 1990 s economic {{boom in the}} United States for the <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policies</b> of the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, observers have noted that very low interest rates have had very little {{positive effect on the}} chronically weak Japanese economy. Therefore, some theory of how money affects the economy when it is endogenous would be useful. This paper pursues several such explanations, including the effects of interest rate changes on (1) investment; (2) consumer spending; (3) the exchange rate; and (4) financial markets. The theories of such authors as Kalecki, Keynes, Minsky, and J. K. Galbraith are discussed and evaluated, with an emphasis on the role of cash flow. Some of these theories turn out to be stronger than others when subjected to tests of logic and empirical evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the financial markets in fall 2007 and the following debt crisis in the EU have produced an enormous mistrust in financial products and the monetary system. The paper describes {{the background of the}} crisis induced by functional failures in risk management and the multifold principal agent problems existing in the financial market structures. The innovated nontransparent financial products especially by the so-called shadow banks have mixed up differential risk weights and puzzled or even fooled formerly loyal customers. Contemporaneously abundant liquidity on the international financial market accompanied by <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policies</b> of the Fed in the US and the ECB in the euro zone have depressed the real interest rate to zero or even negative values. Desperate investors are seeking for safe-assets but their demand remains unsatisfied. Low real interest rates and the consequently lacking compound interest effect in the same time jeopardize private as well as public insurance schemes being dependent on capital funding: the demo-graphic crisis becomes gloomy. Therefore, the managers of the financial markets have to reestablish CSR and to sepa-rate the markets into safe-asset areas for the usual clients and “casino ” areas for those who like to play with high risks. Only with transparency and risk adequate financial products the lost commitment can be regained...|$|R

The {{rationale}} of {{this research}} goes into {{the origins of the}} economic crises from a different way of economic thinking, hence the professional interest on bringing again into the light the concept of animal spirits, used for the first time from classic liberals like David Hume, developed by doctrine founder John Maynard Keynes, and captured as groundbreaking economic crisis hypothesis in Nobel Prize laureates ’ books like George Akerlof. A familiar account of the last financial crisis underlines the collapse of confidence and evaporation of trust which leaded to failure of corporate governance and <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy.</b> Nor were these problems of recent origin; they were rooted in deep structural changes in the economy that date back many years. Financial innovations overheated the world economy and gained steam because of irrational exuberance over a risk free better future.

40|$|Retirees beware. The <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> of the Federal Open Market Committee and the 15 {{percent tax}} rate on {{qualified}} dividends have encouraaged retirees, especially middle-income retired savers, to reorient their nest eggs away from certificates of deposit, treasuries, and {{money market funds}} to dividend-paying stocks and mutual funds. According to the IRS, 43 percent of taxpayers age 65 or older reported qualified dividend income amounting to {{nearly half of the}} qualified dividend income reported by all taxpayers. By contrast, 46 percent of taxpayers age 65 or older reported net capital gains amounting to 30. 5 percent of the net capital gains reported by all taxpayers. But 2013 is coming, and unless Congress extends the current rates or reaches an agreement on tax reform, dividends will be taxed as ordinary income at a marginal rate as high as 39. 6 percent and most net capital gains will be taxed at 20 percent. For those whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds a specified amount (for example, $ 250, 000 for a married couple filing jointly and $ 200, 000 for an unmarried individual), a 3. 8 percent Medicare tax will be added to the taxation of their net capital gain, dividend income, interest, and other investment income, bringing the highest marginal rate to 43. 4 percent...|$|E
40|$|Exchange rate {{flexibility}} is commonly justified as an efficient method for adjusting the trade balance to some desirable net international capital flow. In this orthodox view, fluctuations in a country's {{terms of trade}} or its saving-investment balance would continually upset its {{balance of payments equilibrium}} if the nominal exchange rate remained rigid. But this prevailing doctrine favoring exchange {{flexibility is}} only correct when economies are â€œinsularâ€, ie. have limited trade and financial arbitrage with the outside world. With the spread of exchange controls and trade restrictions in the 1930 s into the 1950 s, the industrial countries became somewhat insulated from each other. A devaluation could then have the conventional effect of reducing a trade deficit because monetary and exchange rate policy were separable. Among the open industrial economies of the 1980 s, however, financial arbitrage is uninhibited and trade is fairly free. Monetary policy, both current and prospective, now dominates what happens to the exchange rate. Because a devaluation today reflects an <b>easier</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> in the present, or an expected easing in the future, it no longer has any predictable impact on the monetary value of the net trade balance. Exchange rate flexibility loses its usefulness in controlling net exports while becoming highly disruptive to the economy's macroeconomic stability. For example, the American dollar's downard float {{over the past three years}} should not be (have been) expected to improve the U. S. current account. However, allowing the dollar to depreciate below its purchasing power parity greatly increases the inflationary potential in the Americian economy. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1990...|$|R
40|$|Many {{emerging}} markets have undertaken significant financial sector reforms especially in their banking sectors {{that have been}} quite critical for both financial development and real economic activity. In this paper, we investigate the success of banking reforms in India where significant banking reforms have been introduced since 1990 s. Using the argument that well-functioning credit markets would reflect a bank channel for monetary policy at work, we test whether a change in monetary policy has predictable impact on borrowing behaviour of several types of firms, including business group affiliated, unaffiliated private firms, state-owned firms and foreign firms. The empirical results suggest that unaffiliated private firms have the most vulnerable to monetary policy stance during tight policy regimes. We also find that during tight monetary policy regimes, smaller firms are much more affected by monetary policy than large firms. In an <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> regime, monetary <b>policy</b> and the associated change in interest rate does not affect change in bank credit, change in total debt {{and the proportion of}} bank credit in total debt for any of the firms. We discuss the policy implications of the findings...|$|R

40|$|The paper first {{investigates the}} causes of the recent {{financial}} and liquidity crisis in the US and all over the world as a preliminary phase of the imminent recession. It then questions Paulson-Bernanke’s plan as a solution to the crisis and ponders over the differences between EU plan and the American one. Finally, it provides an overview of some apparent consequences of the crisis and anticipates some major critical issues in the future. The crux of the paper is to argue that the <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> and lack of the state regulation which are usually regarded as {{the causes of}} the crisis should be understood as the specific features of a particular model of accumulation, namely the neo-liberal or American type of capitalism. The roots of the crisis lie in this type of accumulation. In this context, Paulson-Bernanke’s plan provides only a further impetus to merging and acquisitions in the banking sector, a process that has already led to the emergence of three giant banks, namely Stanley Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citicorp. In fact, if the Glass-Steagall Act has become discredited in the nineties, the concentration of the banking sector during this recent crisis make the whole financial system more fragile and vulnerable to systemic risks. Moreover, the state will be hold up by giant banks and should bailout them whenever they encounter financial difficulties. ...|$|E
40|$|The upswing in Europe, North America and Japan since mid- 1975 {{has been}} unsteady. It has been {{sufficiently}} modest {{to allow a}} — however slight — decline of inflation rates. Since economic policy refrained from massive reflation, the shortrun outlook remains for a moderate recovery with no rekindling of inflation. High unemployment and weak investment can partly {{be attributed to the}} abrupt change to a restrictive course in 1973 / 1974 which led to unintended increases of real wages and to a dramatic profit squeeze. Moreover, there have been increasing changes in the structure of demand and production techniques as well as political uncertainties which have prevented a marked improvement of the investment climate. This diagnosis calls for a steady economic policy, less aggressive wage policy, and incentives to promote innovative spirit and risk taking. Although money illusion and exchange rate illusion have largely vanished and reduced the effectiveness of short-term stimulation measures, most countries are far from pursuing a steady and pre-announced course. In strong countries — the United States, West Germany and Japan — the reduction of the share of public absorption especially through a shortfall of public investment since 1974 was a retarding factor for improving employment and growth. In weak countries — for example the United Kingdom and Italy — an <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> continued to produce high inflation rates and increasing external imbalances. Only after drastic exchange rate depreciations in 1976 did these countries — sometimes too drastically — turn to a restrictive policy course. Cooperation in matters of economic policy, often misunderstood as the sharing of evils, should be designed as help for self-help. International credits should be granted under the condition that the recipient country pursues a stability-oriented policy and refrains from restricting trade. [...] ...|$|E
