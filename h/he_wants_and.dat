25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E

Khal Drogo agrees to give him the [...] "golden crown" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> Viserys lets his guard down, allowing Drogo's bloodriders to restrain him. Drogo melts his belt in a stewpot, and Viserys realises to his horror that the [...] "golden crown" [...] is actually molten gold, which Drogo pours on his head. Daenerys watches her brother's painful death calmly, and coldly observes: [...] "He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon." ...|$|E

Regina put Moe up to the robbery because she wants Mr. Gold to say his real name.

500|$|Brener noted when Mars' audio {{infrastructure}} evolved substantially, when Berry {{took over}} the only model he would use was Sennheiser wireless. The latter's opinion was respected and trusted due to his experience in working [...] with Beyoncé, Weezer {{and lots of other}} bands. Nevertheless, Berry and Brener tried several capsule and transmitter combinations before [...] "settling" [...] with a SKM 5200 handheld transmitter and a MD 5235 capsule. Berry stated that Mars is not only involved with him and Brener [...] "on the way things sound", but also [...] "has very clear ideas on what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> what he expects". Regardless of the place where Mars is going to perform he will only use Sennheiser; [...] "there is no debating [...] he wants Sennheiser, and that's what he's going to get", says Berry. As {{for the rest of the}} vocals and horns, the wireless system has ten channels of Sennheiser EM 3732-II receivers, seven SKM 5200-II transmitters with MD 5235 capsules and three SK 5212-II bodypack transmitters.|$|E
500|$|In January 1947 Olivier {{began working}} on his second film as a director, Hamlet (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The {{original}} play was heavily cut {{to focus on the}} relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in The Observer, considered it [...] "less effective than [...] stage work.... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, knows exactly what <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> gets it". Campbell Dixon, the critic for The Daily Telegraph thought the film [...] "brilliant... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films." [...] Hamlet became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand is that he does what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E

500|$|The Experiment is a pop rock album, {{featuring}} {{guitar and}} synth riffs, and incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop rap and power pop. Some {{parts of the}} album contain auto-tuned vocals, and the record {{has been described as}} having an [...] "international" [...] feel. Rumble said that this was because he and Campbell made sure that the album [...] "sounded big [...] it could compete on the world stage". Thematically, The Experiment is [...] "about love, heartbreak, getting what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> knowing he is in charge of his own destiny", although [...] "Let You Down" [...] is [...] "quite dark and weighty". Many of the song's discuss Rumble's own life experiences; some are reflective while others [...] "just try to get other people enthused about what they're doing with their lives". [...] "Always Be Here" [...] discusses maintaining a romantic relationship while constantly travelling, and [...] "What Are You Waiting For?" [...] is [...] "about being motivated and assessing your own life, which is exactly what happened to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to {{be funny}} and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One {{occasion}} in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did not like this because, according to Greno, Flynn [...] "did this reaction where [...] treated her like she's nuts". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to [...] "connect" [...] emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is [...] "at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, [...] "At his heart, he's really kind of a lost soul who doesn't quite know what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> who he is." [...] Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, [...] "are skilled but have a human side to them". Flynn is considered an antihero because [...] "He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive" [...] and [...] "he is also extremely narcissistic".|$|E
500|$|Mullally later stated he did {{not know}} he was auditioning for a recast, he also stated that he wasn't sure if he could be {{successful}} in the role to start with. He also watched hours of footage of previous episodes {{to get an idea of}} how to portray Declan, then making a statement to Declan fans reading: [...] "I'm sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with the same character name – I'm not fooling myself about that. But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E

500|$|Darren's ex-girlfriend, Suzanne, returns, {{pregnant}} by Darren with twins. Dawson said, [...] "At first [...] doesn’t {{believe her}} and he thinks it's a wind-up. When she threatens {{to go back to}} Spain he realises it's not what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shrewsbury was {{considered}} quite a slow scoring batsman, but C. B. Fry described his play thus: [...] "The {{idea that he}} is slow is mistaken. True, he is often half an hour without scoring; but somehow he makes up for it and is all but even with his more mobile partner. The fact is he waits for the ball <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> then secures a certain fourer. He does not waste time and energy in banging ball after ball into fieldsman's hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|According {{to various}} {{official}} materials from Sega, Sonic {{is described as}} a character who is [...] "like the wind": a drifter who lives as <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>and</b> makes life a series of events and adventures. Sonic hates oppression and staunchly defends freedom. Although he is mostly quick-witted and easygoing, he has a short temper and is often impatient with slower things. Sonic is a habitual daredevil hedgehog who is honest, loyal to friends, keeps his promises, and dislikes tears. He took the young Tails under his wing like a little brother, and is uninterested in marital proposals from Amy Rose. In times of crisis, he focuses intensely on the challenge as if his personality had undergone an astonishing change.|$|E
2500|$|Barbeau's then-husband, {{director}} John Carpenter, {{cast her}} in his horror film, The Fog (1980), which was her first theatrical film appearance. The film was released on February 1, 1980, and was a theatrical success, grossing over $21 million in the United States alone, and establishing Barbeau as a genre film star. She subsequently appeared {{in a number of}} early-1980s horror and science fiction films, a number of which have now become cult film classics, including Escape from New York (also from Carpenter), Creepshow and Swamp Thing. Of her screen work with Carpenter, Barbeau has stated: [...] "John is a great director. He knows what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>and</b> he knows how to get it.
