5|$|Dr. Heather Brooks dies in {{the premier}} of season ten. She goes {{to search for}} Dr. Webber and finds him lying in the {{basement}} of the hospital. Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> falls. Bailey moves a cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job overseas while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief of Fetal Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. Dr. Herman mentors Arizona Robbins in a fetal surgery fellowship, and plays in a twelve episode arc before departing after episode fourteen.|$|E
25|$|When the zombies {{invade the}} mall, Asami uses some firecrackers to divert their attention. Shortly after {{breaking}} out of the mall with the group, she attempts to save a frightened student trapped {{on top of a}} truck in the parking lot. She and Shimada distract the zombies long enough for the student to escape, however Asami herself becomes trapped without any more bullets. Asami shouts that she hates Kohta, although Takashi immediately recognizes and tells Kohta that she is just yelling to attract the zombies so that they can escape. She shouts out one final request for Kohta not to allow her to become a zombie, and Kohta sadly aims his rifle at <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> salutes goodbye.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ere it is," [...] {{said the}} young pilot, pausing {{at the top}} of the staircase, near the {{entrance}} to a very dark passage. [...] "Keep <b>'er</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes, but I'd recommend you to shorten sail, mind your 'elm, an 'ave the anchor ready to let go." ...|$|R
60|$|Tuppence shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{reviewed}} <b>her</b> backsliding.|$|R
60|$|Her uncle still {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} her identity, and still talked over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> did not exist.|$|R
500|$|Following the pie {{attack on}} the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to {{overturn}} their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> and Green held hands and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped [...] "At least it's a fruit pie." [...] An image of her covered with the pastry appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times the next day.|$|E
500|$|Sasha Geffen from MTV News noted Gaga's eyes {{rolling back}} in <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> moshes {{with the crowd}} in the clip and [...] "at one point she almost rips the head off of [...] ". Similar {{thoughts}} were echoed in Lara Walsh's review of the clip for InStyle, where she fawned about being a [...] "big fan" [...] of Gaga's [...] "raw appearance" [...] in the video. Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it". Callegari complimented the visuals for bringing out Gaga as both a performer and singer, [...] "and this video invites us to enjoy her in her purest form".|$|E
2500|$|So, the 'shrouded in snow' phrase may {{refer to}} the [...] "coldness and frigidity of the {{situation}} in which she is trapped"; to the white flowers that covered <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was being dragged off; to the covering of snow on the ground during Winter prior to the re-appearance of the flowers. The aspiration of whiteness towards 'golden' yellowness is also in play here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But he's as cocky as ever,' said Matilda, {{narrowing}} {{her eyes}} and shaking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> knowingly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> handed the frying-pan.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Belmont's {{eyes were}} far away, and <b>she</b> shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gently put the girl's hands aside.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> leaned lovingly {{against his}} shoulder. 'You are not sorry, Hester, {{that you have}} become my wife?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{eventually}} the Mackenzies {{gained control of}} Lewis some islanders still resisted, notably Neil MacLeod and Dòmhnall Cam. Around this time tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam fortified himself on a [...] high promontory of jagged rock on the sea-coast near Mangursta (or Mangersta, Scottish Gaelic: Mangarstadh). Today the stack still bears his name: Stac Dhòmhnaill Chaim. Tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam's daughter, Anna Mhòr ("Big Anne") carried water to her father on <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> needed her hands to climb the cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|Esther {{is shown}} {{seated at the}} center of the canvas, arms above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{arranges}} her blond coiffure. Preparing to offer herself for the king's approval, she holds a pose that is [...] "profoundly erotic in its pictorial treatment". She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, staring out of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky.|$|E
60|$|Obediently poor Elspie tried, but shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did so.|$|E
60|$|I had {{anticipated}} {{that she would}} laugh at me. No! <b>She</b> suddenly raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were looking at me intently in the dark.|$|R
60|$|She did not speak, but bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were {{intent upon}} some work, and so seated herself that her countenance was almost hid.|$|R
60|$|Linda's black figure {{detached}} itself {{upright on}} {{the light of the}} lantern with her arms raised above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> were going to throw herself over.|$|R
60|$|Charley shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> methodically {{drew his}} rags {{about him and}} made him as warm as she could.|$|E
60|$|Poor Nora hung <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{asked in}} a low voice if Jim really thought her father was engaged in illegal practices.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, he ain't indeed!' {{said the}} poor woman, shaking <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at the}} four {{children}} in succession, and then at him.|$|E
60|$|My aunt {{smoothed}} {{her dress and}} shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> smoothed defiance {{of the whole world}} out of the one, and shook it out of the other.|$|R
60|$|Not she. She {{had seen}} nothing {{but her father}} until now. She saw Mr Jonas now, though; and blushed, and hung <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gave him welcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I was forgetting his play," [...] Katharine remarked, {{and turning}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> saw {{something}} that needed her attention {{in a far}} corner of the room, she left them.|$|R
60|$|But Lady Greystoke only shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had {{a hundred}} other times when the subject had claimed her {{attention}} in the past.|$|E
60|$|He {{came up to}} them, and {{his wife}} folded her hands upon his shoulder, and shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> laid it on her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't weigh {{as much as}} {{you ought}} to, Jim," [...] remarked the girl, shaking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at the animal. [...] "You're dreadfully skinny." ...|$|E
60|$|At length, however, he {{made out}} {{a dark and}} hazy mass {{over the edge of}} the mainsail, which he {{supposed}} was land, and in another few minutes a blinking light appeared. He called to Harry, who merely twisted himself around on the boom with the object of looking out beneath the sail and then told him to keep <b>her</b> <b>heading</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was. After that the land rose rapidly, growing blacker, and a second light appeared. This was closer to them and Frank, thinking he saw it move, noticed a green blink beneath it.|$|R
6000|$|As Gulliver spoke, {{he looked}} up at the little black face bent over him, and saw tears in the child's sad eyes; but she smiled at him, and shook <b>her</b> fuzzy <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> whispered kindly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Call {{all hands}} {{to work the}} pumps; and don't let the men know how much water {{there is in the}} hold. Come below, Ned. I want you. Keep <b>her</b> <b>head</b> steady <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Up {{the road}} a piece," [...] and the old lady motioned with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke. [...] "But now, if my son Jimmie was in that accident--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems to have {{something}} on his mind," [...] continued Miss Jelks, with a toss of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> placed the sugar-bowl and other articles on the table.|$|E
60|$|Bridge's companions and Willie Case looked their {{surprise}} at his {{mention of a}} bear; but the gypsy girl only nodded <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had occasionally during his narrative.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hooray!" [...] yelled {{the young}} woodchucks, and away they {{ran through the}} paths of the garden, {{followed}} slowly by their fat mother, who held the lace parasol over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> feared she would be sunstruck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! how is she? Why did she {{not come}} with you?" [...] sobbed Edith; while Dick Prince, seating {{himself on a}} rock, drew her on his knee and stroked <b>her</b> fair <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> wept upon his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know 'bout that," [...] said Miss Roxy, {{flavoring}} her cup of tea; [...] "hymn-book ain't Scriptur', and I'm {{pretty sure}} that ar ain't true always;" [...] and <b>she</b> nodded <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> could say more if she chose.|$|R
