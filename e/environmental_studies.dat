40|$|Abstract：To {{investigate}} the procedure of studentʼs <b>environmental</b> <b>study</b> by Hypothesis-experiment-instruction method learning, “Law of conservation of mass ” was learned at a <b>environmental</b> <b>study</b> class, {{elementary school in}} Thailand. At the <b>environmental</b> <b>study</b> class “Substance and Weight ” of 5 th grade 45 students, “the Law of conservation of mass ” was taught by 7 steps of practical experiment using water, clay, wood piece, stone, sugar, cookie, and weight scale and balance scale. Consciousness and understanding of students on each step of learning were measured using estimation worksheets by 7 steps of “Substance and Weight ” experiment. It was investigated that the students got over the understanding on “the Law of conservation of mass ” during each step of experiments, and improvement on consciousness of interest and will for practical <b>environmental</b> <b>study</b> activities. This practical study let it became plain about the procedure of students ʼ understanding; “which step made the students to be clear with <b>environmental</b> <b>study</b> with Hypothesis-experiment-instruction method about the Law of conservation of mass”...|$|R

5|$|After <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> on the White Slough, Caltrans widened and {{elevated}} {{that section of}} the road and converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> develop, exotic species attract more {{attention}} and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E

5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E
5|$|GeoJourney was {{a special}} {{academic}} program conducted by the School of Earth, Environment, and Society that featured a nine-week field trip/camping trip/road trip across the United States to national parks and monuments granting 24 students a semester of college credit.

Students on the journey conducted interdisciplinary field investigations and gained first-hand experiences {{in a wide range}} of environments. In 2004 the first GeoJourney trip went to 24 states, 30 national parks and covered over 14,500 miles across the United States. The program was pulled from the University in 2013 by its creators Nichole and Ian Rodgers.|$|E

5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
5|$|While that {{construction}} was being done, MDOT truncated US10 at Bay City in 1986; this removed the concurrency between US10 and US23 that existed since 1926. A {{few years later}} in 1992, the freeway concept for the northeastern LP was revived again when MDOT initiated plans to study and build a new US23 freeway from Standish northerly to Tawas City, Oscoda or Alpena. This proposal was brought up due to {{a high level of}} tourist traffic along the current routing since the mid-1960s. The FHWA mandated additional <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> for the project in 2000, and MDOT withdrew the proposals two years later.|$|E

5|$|In June 2006, erosion {{resulting}} from heavy rains exposed human remains near the westbound lanes of Route 37 in Cranston. Subsequent drainage {{improvements to the}} freeway led {{to the discovery of}} human remains from more than 70 individuals buried in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Archaeological research indicated that the portion of Route 37 in Cranston between Exits 2 and 3 was inadvertently constructed over a portion of the State Farm Cemetery in the 1960s. The cemetery's wooden burial markers had deteriorated by the time Route 37 was constructed, and <b>environmental</b> <b>studies</b> that would have indicated the location of the cemetery were not conducted prior to the expressway's construction. In late 2006, the remains of 71 individuals were exhumed from the site of the previous cemetery and re-interred at the State Institution Cemetery in Warwick. On July 14, 2009, RIDOT hosted a memorial service for the 71 people re-interred in Warwick.|$|E
