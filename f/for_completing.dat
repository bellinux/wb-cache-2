5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as a competent and professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than other female gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes that players receive as rewards <b>for</b> <b>completing</b> certain tasks within the games.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} a {{different}} system in terms of rewarding experience points. It rewards experience points for killing enemies, but only until their respective entries in the bestiary are completed. Additionally, the game gives experience points only <b>for</b> <b>completing</b> quests and discovering new areas. This means that non-violent approaches such as stealth are just as rewarding.|$|E

5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options <b>for</b> <b>completing</b> the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} the {{southern}} portion of SR75 in mid-1974. In January 1976, the part of SR75 between I-805 and Otay Mesa Road was opened to traffic. On April 6, the next portion of the freeway opened. However, there were concerns about what to call the freeway, citing confusion with the northern portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took effect at the beginning of 1977.

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards <b>for</b> <b>completing</b> missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E
