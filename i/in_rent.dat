2500|$|California {{has more}} {{rigidity}} and friction in both its housing market and <b>in</b> <b>renting</b> than other states; one study comparing California's market {{to that of}} other states found that between 1970 and 2000, tenure of owned homes increased by 10% and <b>in</b> <b>renting</b> by 19%, and attributed this change to Proposition 13. Other studies have found that increased tenure <b>in</b> <b>renting</b> can be attributed <b>in</b> part to <b>rent</b> control. D.R. Mullins states that “prospects of increased property tax liabilities triggered by residence or business location changes likely constrain mobility and filtering in the housing and property markets.”(pp.118) ...|$|R

5|$|Louis {{brought his}} wife and queen, Marie Joséphine, from {{mainland}} Europe in 1808. Louis's stay at Gosfield Hall did not last long; he soon moved to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where over one hundred courtiers were housed. The King paid £500 <b>in</b> <b>rent</b> each year to the proprietor, Sir George Lee. The Prince of Wales (the future George IV of Great Britain) was very charitable to the exiled Bourbons. As Prince Regent, he granted them permanent right of asylum and extremely generous allowances.|$|E
5|$|The site of Fort Bayard {{itself was}} owned by Philip J. Buckey, a farmer who made {{his home in the}} Fourth Ward of Washington County. During the {{construction}} process, he valued the land at approximately $5,000, and continued to live in a farmhouse near the fort with his wife, four children, and two servants throughout the course of the war. In exchange for the use of his land for the site of Fort Bayard, Buckey received $50.00 per year <b>in</b> <b>rent</b> from the War Department.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s the house had been leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year <b>in</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|E

5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase <b>in</b> <b>rent</b> in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six wills, {{the last}} of which was only written {{a few months before}} her death; and had {{purchased}} twenty-seven estates. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 <b>in</b> <b>rent</b> rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she left little to the poor and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised {{those who}} owned or leased land worth £10 {{or more and}} the Second Reform Act {{extended}} this to all householders paying £10 or more <b>in</b> <b>rent</b> per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended {{the provisions of the}} previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality wouldn't occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{returned}} to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 <b>in</b> <b>rent.</b> This angered Ross {{and contributed to the}} breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a flat in Camden Town with his friend Dinah Snock, whom he had met at an anti-imperialist rally in Trafalgar Square. Kenyatta socialised at the Student Movement House in Russell Square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended various Africans in the city. To earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film Sanders of the River, filmed at Shepperton Studios in Autumn 1934. A number of other Africans in London criticised him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American Paul Robeson.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was named}} the City of Manchester Stadium by Manchester City Council before {{construction}} began in December 1999, but {{has a number of}} commonly used alternatives. City of Manchester Stadium is abbreviated to CoMS when written and spoken. Eastlands refers to the site and the stadium before they were named SportCity and CoMS respectively, and remains in common usage for both the stadium and the whole complex, as does SportCity but with less frequency. The stadium was also officially referred to as Manchester City Stadium for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The football club, under its new ownership, renegotiated its 250-year lease with the city council in October 2010, gaining the naming rights in return for a substantial increase <b>in</b> <b>rent.</b> The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten-year agreement with the team kit sponsors Etihad Airways. The agreement encompasses sponsorship of the stadium's name, extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years, and includes plans to relocate the club's youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy on a new campus development adjacent to the stadium.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{fertility}} {{effects are}} found to vary by homeownership: While the immigration shock had {{a negative impact on}} the fertility of women living <b>in</b> <b>rented</b> homes, it had practically no effect on women living in owned homes. This differential impact is likely due to the rise <b>in</b> local housing <b>rents</b> accompanying immigration, making childbearing activities less affordable for women living <b>in</b> <b>rented</b> homes. This suggests that the housing market is a key pathway through which immigration shocks affect native fertility.|$|R
