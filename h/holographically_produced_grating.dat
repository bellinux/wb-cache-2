However, this modification of the chip is irreversible and leads to a change in the conditions of immobilization of investigated biomolecules on the chip surface. Therefore, it is intriguing to use a functional ultrathin film, e.g., a plasma polymer film, both for adjusting the working range and the interaction with biomolecules. Such films, however, needs to be highly stable in the used environment in order to maintain the working range, which is currently under investigation [24 – 26].|$|R

The great advantage of using CGH is that interferometer-based schemes are no longer necessary, avoiding problems related to long term stability of the interference pattern and multi-beam complex optical setup. Moreover, the CGH technique allows a wider choice of pattern designs. In this preliminary work, we obtained promising results, as for instance the patterning of a square-wave refractive index modulation of a LCpolymeric composite, a pattern which is not achievable with standard two-beam holography.

40|$|Irradiation of {{photosensitive}} {{thin films}} {{results in the}} nanostructures formation in the interaction area. Here, we investigate how the formation of nanostructures in photosensitive waveguide AgCl thin films, doped by Ag nanoparticles, can be customized by tuning the wavelength of the incident beam. We found, silver nanoparticles are pushed towards the interference pattern minima created by the interference of the incident beam with the excited TEn modes of the AgCl Ag waveguide. The interference pattern determines the grating constant of the resulting spontaneous periodic nanostructures. Also, our studies indicate a strong dependence of the shape and size distribution of the formed Ag nanocoalescences on the wavelength of the incident beam. It also influences on the surface coverage of the sample by the formed silver nanoparticles and on period of the self organized nano gratings. It is found, exposure time and intensity of the incident light are the most determinant parameters for the quality and finesse of our nanostructures. More intense incident light with shorter exposure time generates more regular nanostructures with smaller nano coalescences and, <b>produces</b> <b>gratings</b> with higher diffraction efficiency.

A phased array technique is employed to excite multiple cells using time-delayed signals to steer the acoustic beam toward the object.

40|$|Fiber-Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs) {{inscribed with}} a femtosecond laser have proven advantages {{for a variety}} of applications because they exhibit excellent stability at elevated temperatures [1] and under intense optical pumping [2], and can be directly inscribed into virtually any transparent fiber material [3]. Applications in high-power and monolithic fiber lasers and high-temperature sensing have been demonstrated [2, 4]. The point-by-point (PbP) technique for fabricating FBGs with a femtosecond laser is uniquely flexible as it <b>produces</b> <b>gratings</b> which consist of discrete refractive index modifications with sub- to few-micron dimensions, yet with high refractive index contrast.
