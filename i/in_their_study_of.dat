Paris and Windham, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species.

5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued.

5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The Super Quiz Resource Guide is {{a compendium of}} previously published articles, whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused {{on the development of}} Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that swimming in groups enhances foraging success. This ability was demonstrated by Pitcher and others <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> foraging behaviour in shoaling cyprinids. In this study, {{the time it took}} for groups of minnows and goldfish to find a patch of food was quantified. The number of fishes in the groups was varied, and a statistically significant decrease in the amount of time necessary for larger groups to find food was established. Further support for an enhanced foraging capability of schools is seen in the structure of schools of predatory fish. Partridge and others analysed the school structure of Atlantic bluefin tuna from aerial photographs and found that the school assumed a parabolic shape, a fact that was suggestive of cooperative hunting in this species.|$|E
25|$|In Central Europe, {{followed}} by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed {{in reaction to}} Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism.

25|$|Later, Schwartz and Kroll used cognate and {{homograph}} as target words {{presented in}} low- and high-constraint sentences to Spanish-English bilinguals. They investigated how word presentation and the semantic constraint modulated language lexical access in bilinguals. Schwartz and Kroll used rapid serial visual presentation {{and the target}} word had to be named. No homograph effects were found, but less proficient bilinguals made more naming errors, especially in low-constraint sentences. They observed cognate facilitation (nonselective bilingual lexical access) in low-constraint sentences, but not in high-constraint ones. The {{results suggest that the}} semantic constraint of a sentence may restrict cross-lingual activation effects. Similar results on cognate effects were obtained by van Hell and de Groot <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Dutch-English bilinguals in an L2 lexical decision task and a translation task in forward (from L1 to L2) and in backward direction (from L2 to L1).

500|$|Harrison later {{recalled}} his {{two months in}} the United States as having been [...] "such a good time", yet [...] "the moment I got back with the Beatles , {{it was just too}} difficult". These difficulties included having to endure McCartney's habit of dictating how the others should play their instruments and Lennon's increasing withdrawal from the band and emotional dependence on his ever-present partner, Yoko Ono. The couple had recently descended into heroin addiction, leaving Lennon, in author Peter Doggett's words, [...] "emotionally removed and artistically bankrupt". <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the Get Back project, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that, as another frustration for Harrison, Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked his compositions, even when they were [...] "far better than their own".|$|E

500|$|Although Fillmore {{has become}} {{something}} of a cult figure as America's most forgettable chief executive, Smith [...] found him to be [...] "a conscientious president" [...] who chose to honor his oath of office and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, rather than govern based on his personal preferences. Paul G. Calabresi and Christopher S. Yoo, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> presidential power, deemed Fillmore [...] "a faithful executor of the laws of the United States—for good and for ill". But, according to Smith, the enforcement of the act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation. Fillmore's place in history has also suffered because [...] "even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856". Smith argued that Fillmore's association with the Know Nothings looks far worse in retrospect than it did at the time, and that the former president was not motivated by nativism in his candidacy.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{presented}} an early {{draft of the}} song on 7 January, during a day marked by acrimony within the group. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the tapes from the Get Back project, authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles rehearsed [...] "For You Blue" [...] half-heartedly, amid heated discussions about their future and with Harrison in disagreement with McCartney over the proposed concert. Adding to Harrison's dissatisfaction {{since the start of}} the Twickenham rehearsals, his compositions [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Let It Down" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] had received little enthusiasm from Lennon and McCartney. The Beatles returned to [...] "For You Blue" [...] on 9 January, by which time Harrison had completed the lyrics. He suggested that the song required an acoustic arrangement akin to skiffle or, citing slide guitarist Son House as an example, traditional country blues. The following day, Harrison walked out of the sessions, weary of what he considered to be McCartney's overbearing attitude and Lennon's lack of engagement with the project.|$|E
500|$|The secular {{effects of}} Planet Nine can deliver extreme trans-Neptunian objects into orbits roughly {{perpendicular}} to {{the plane of the}} Solar System. Several objects with high inclinations, greater than 60°, and large semi-major axes, above 250 AU, have been observed. Their high inclination orbits can be generated by a high order secular resonance with Planet Nine involving a linear combination of the orbit's arguments and longitudes of perihelion: Δϖ - 2ω. Objects that reach low eccentricities during their secular evolution can enter this resonance. The resonance causes their eccentricities and inclinations to increase, delivering them into perpendicular orbits with low perihelia where they are more readily observed. The orbits then evolve into retrograde orbits with lower eccentricities after which they pass through a second phase of high eccentricity perpendicular orbits before returning to low eccentricity, low inclination orbits. Unlike the Kozai mechanism this resonance causes objects to reach their maximum eccentricities when in nearly perpendicular orbits. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown this evolution was relatively common, with 38% of stable objects undergoing it at least once. Saillenfest et al. also observed this behavior <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the secular dynamics of eTNOs and noted that it caused the perihelia to fall below 30 AU for objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU, and with Planet Nine in an inclined orbit it could occur for objects with semi-major axes as small as 150 AU. Six objects with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU and perihelia beyond Jupiter's orbit are currently known: ...|$|E
40|$|An Introduction to Visual Research Methods in Tourismis {{the first}} book to present, discuss and promote {{the use of a}} range of visual methods in tourism studies. It {{introduces}} methods ranging from the collection of secondary visual materials for the purposes of analysis (such as postcards, tourism brochures, and websites) and the creation of visuals in the context of primary research (such as photography, video and drawings), to the production of data through photo-elicitation techniques. The book promotes thoroughly underpinned interdisciplinary visual tourism research and includes an exploration of many key philosophical, methodological and inter-disciplinary approaches. Comprised of five parts: introduction; paradigms, academic disciplines and theory; methods; analysis and representation; and conclusion. This volume informs and inspires its readers through a reliance on theory, examples from tourism studies conducted in various geographical locations and through key pedagogical features such as annotated further readings, practical tips boxes and concise chapter summaries. This book will be of interest to experienced visual tourism researchers, scholars wishing to incorporate visual methods <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> tourism for the very first time, as well as students on undergraduate, postgraduate or doctoral programmes who are contemplating the incorporation <b>of</b> visual methods <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> tourism...|$|R
