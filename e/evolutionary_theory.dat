5|$|The most {{significant}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory</b> before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory</b> based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In a Forum article Le Bourg (1998) criticized recent {{tests of}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> {{of aging and}} {{suggested}} alternative explanations for the long lifespan of ant queens and the positive relationship between body size and lifespan in mammals. Moreover, he attempts to criticize <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging by showing that explanations other than <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging probably account for the variation in human lifespan across countries. OBJECTIVE: Here we show that the arguments of Le Bourg suffer several problems. First, many of the arguments reveal a misunderstanding {{of the process of}} natural selection. Second, some of the arguments reflect a lack of knowledge of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging (e. g. pre-reproductive mortality is not predicted to influence lifespan of organisms contrary to what is claimed). Finally, his final example on lifespan in humans simply is a straw-man because serious evolutionary biologists are well {{aware of the importance of}} confounding variables and would certainly not make the type of conclusion suggested by Le Bourg. CONCLUSION: Although a critical discussion of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging is welcome, we believe that the alternative explanations proposed by Le Bourg are implausible and reflect a misunderstanding of the process of natural selection...|$|R

5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory,</b> the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory.</b> This {{was due to}} the paucity of {{morphological}} traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes.

Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>theory</b> changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{assumption}} of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging is that age-specific differences of life history traits may have genetic causes. The present study {{focuses on the}} existence of such differences between eight freshly caught populations of Drosophila melanogaster. A highly significant differentiation of the populations is observed, yet it accounts for a relatively small part of the variance. It is also shown that large discrepancies may be found between the estimations of fitness based, on the one hand, on data for egg production and, on the other hand, on fertility data. This stresses the need for accurate measurements of fitness for the assessment of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories.</b> Finally, the results suggest that neither of the current <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging is generally valid. Indeed, the age-specific differences that are found between the populations match either the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism, or the concordant pleiotropy mechanism, or none of them...|$|R
5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory,</b> Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theory</b> {{continues}} to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide {{students}} and researchers entering the field of aging studies with an introduction to the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging, as well as to orient them in the abundant modern scientific literature on evolutionary gerontology. The following three major <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> of aging are discussed: 1) the theory of programmed death suggested by August Weismann, 2) the mutation accumulation theory of aging suggested by Peter Medawar, and 3) the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggested by George Williams. We also discuss a special case of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, the disposable soma theory developed by Tom Kirkwood and Robin Holliday. The theories are compared with each other as well as with recent experimental findings. At present the most viable <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theories</b> are the mutation accumulation theory and the antagonistic pleiotropy theory; these theories are not mutually exclusive, and they both may become a part of a future unifying theory of aging...|$|R
