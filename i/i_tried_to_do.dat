500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, [...] "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey and her {{management}} {{then decided}} to release [...] "It's Like That" [...] as the album's lead single, calling it [...] "the right fire-starter". The singer has praised Dupri for being [...] "focused", and felt that together they had composed some of her favorite songs on the album. She has told MTV, [...] "The album is not about making the older executives happy by making a bring-down-the-house, tearjerker ballad, or [...] steeped in the media dramas of my life. What <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was keep the sessions very sparse, underproduced, like in '70s soul music ... According to Reid, Carey intended for the album to feature a more unpolished sound than her previous releases. The singer had been frustrated with the overproduction on many of her previous records, due to the inclusion of what she considered unnecessary [...] "bells and whistles". She opted to record the majority of The Emancipation of Mimi live, alongside the band. Reid agreed with this decision and felt that the live vocals made the album sound more authentic.|$|E

500|$|His {{style of}} play was hard on his left knee, leading to {{injuries}} and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee took all of the punishment and was operated on [...] "13 or 14" [...] times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He 'protected the puck', leading with his left knee, and holding his left arm up to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. [...] "It was the way I played," [...] Orr has said. [...] "I liked to carry the puck {{and if you do}} that, you're going to get hit. I wish I'd played longer, but I don't regret it." [...] Orr stated in 2008. [...] "I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things. I didn't want to sit back. I wanted to be involved." ...|$|E

John Bush commented: [...] "'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its {{fragmented}} style made it essentially cover-proof." [...] In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: [...] "Oh, he did a marvelous job, {{he did a great}} job. I was very proud of his version." [...] Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: [...] "I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting—like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much.

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good.

2500|$|After {{the album}} and two {{supporting}} tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped {{in favor of}} Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Though the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied {{in large part because}} he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. However, rather than betray what the band Death meant and sounded like to the fans, he opted to create a new band: [...] "For me, it {{is just a matter of}} evolving, doing it the right way. I didn't put out a Death record with this stuff on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything the right way." [...] As Schuldiner finished Control Denied's debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner's condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital.

[...] The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen." [...] Fisher explained, [...] "Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past—Control, Rhythm Nation, janet.—would be represented." [...] Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, [...] "The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage." [...] "And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin LED screen." [...] Roy Bennett stated [...] "We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over.
