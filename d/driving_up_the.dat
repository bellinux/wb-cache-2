5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, {{in which}} commanders tried to raid enemy lands and seize castles {{in order to}} allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory, ultimately winning slow but strategic victories. Pitched battles were occasionally fought between armies but these were considered risky engagements and usually avoided by prudent commanders. The armies of the period comprised bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry. Crossbowmen become more numerous in the 12th century, alongside the older shortbow. At the heart of these armies was the familia regis, the permanent military household of the king, which was supported in war by feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign. Mercenaries were increasingly employed, <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cost of warfare considerably, and adequate supplies of ready cash became essential for the success of campaigns.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday afternoon, Matt Kenseth was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.321 seconds, ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt. Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he came down the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

After 3 years of fighting they took the pass and forced Qin to return territory to Han and Wei. They next inflicted major defeats on Yan and Chu.

25|$|Consequently, the filmed {{version of}} the novel altered {{the details of the}} plan. Although the {{audience}} is initially led to believe Goldfinger is going to steal the gold, the real plot is revealed to be to render the gold contained in the Depository radioactive and useless, crippling the gold standard-based economy and thereby dramatically <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> price of the gold Goldfinger already owns. A scene in the film even uses a confrontation between Goldfinger and Bond to point out logistical flaws in the plan as set out in the original novel.|$|E
25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return {{because it can}} concentrate its investments in {{a small number of}} good opportunities without <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole.

25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area {{began to realize that}} they could live there full-time and commute to their jobs in the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing the total amount of land available for development and thus <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd Battle of Longstop Hill or the Capture of Longstop Hill {{took place}} in Tunisia during the Tunisia Campaign from 21 to 23 April 1943. The battle was fought for control over the heights of Djebel el Ahmera and Djebel Rhar, {{together}} known as Longstop Hill and vicinity, between the British forces of the First Army and German units of the 5th Panzer Army. The infantry of the 78th Battleaxe Division and Churchill tanks of the North Irish Horse captured Longstop Hill after bitter fighting, in which the tanks created a measure of tactical surprise by <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill, a manoeuvre that only Churchill tanks could achieve. The attackers broke through the German defences, which were the last great natural barrier {{on the road to}} Tunis.|$|E

25|$|The Commissioners met for {{the first}} time on 6 June 1760, and planned the {{take-over}} of all of the drainage mills in the region, the construction of new ones, and the digging of the main drainage channels which would feed surface water to the mills and into the rivers. To finance these operations, there were empowered to borrow money, and to charge a drainage rate of 1 shilling (5p) per acre, rising to 1/6d (7.5p) after seven years. The costs of carrying out such work were grossly optimistic, and the commissioners were soon in financial difficulties. Despite this, and heavy flooding in the winter of 1761/2, which resulted in no taxes being collected, the Commissioners owned eight mills by 1774, each of which used a scoop wheel to lift water into the rivers. The costs of maintenance and repair of the mills were high, not helped by the Naval shipbuilding programme <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cost of oak.|$|E

In late 1917, the Navy proposed to expand the eight-four plan by adding two more battlecruisers; this was approved, and two more Amagi-class ships were ordered. However, having eight [...] gun ships (four battleships and four battlecruisers) on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending {{about a third of}} its national budget on the Navy.

Evans did not start the event because his car stopped on the track's halfway section while driving to his starting position. Sørensen stalled in his grid position but was unable to start shortly afterwards before he was issued with a ten-second time penalty because his mechanics were tending to his car after the 15-second signal was given. Matsushita was required to start from the pit lane because of his collision with de Jong in the feature event. When the race started, pole position starter Maricello made a slow start and was overtaken around the outside by Stanaway heading into the first corner. Maricello fended off challenges by Sirotkin, Leal and Canamasas. Rossi damaged his nosecone and front wing in a collision with the rear-end of Pic's car but continued. Cecotto squeezed Amberg sideways into the barriers while <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill to Massenet corner, forcing the retirement of both cars.|$|E

The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{some critics}} argue that Daubert has {{disrupted}} the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, “The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then {{not be able to}} meet their required burden of proof. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendant’s experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then Daubert has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.” [...] Similarly, Daubert hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to <b>driving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> costs of the litigation forcing settlement.|$|E
