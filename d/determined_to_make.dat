Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

5|$|In 1533 Henry {{broke with}} Pope Paul III {{in order to}} annul the long-standing {{marriage}} to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of King Charles V of Spain, who took the annulment as a personal insult. As a consequence, France and the Empire declared an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain; that summer Henry made a personal inspection {{of some of his}} coastal defences, which had recently been mapped and surveyed: he appeared <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> substantial, urgent improvements.|$|E
5|$|In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken {{reputation}} {{made her}} {{the subject of a}} Los Angeles Times article, profiling her as a woman <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the court system work for the common good.

She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases. After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Magnolia, Anderson stated {{that he would like}} to work with comedic actor Adam Sandler in the future and that he was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his next film a {{comparatively}} shorter length of just 90 minutes. The resulting feature was the romantic comedy-drama film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), starring Sandler, with Emily Watson portraying his love interest. The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner (Sandler) with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters.

At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.|$|E

The band pretend to be inane fops, effectively throwing off any suspicions about {{the identity of the}} League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Under Percy's strict orders, Marguerite is told nothing of this.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, on June 13, 1971, The New York Times began {{printing}} {{large portions}} of the Pentagon Papers. The papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the Vietnam War, of which former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> public. Ellsberg had {{for a year and}} a half approached members of Congress – such as William Fulbright, George McGovern, Charles Mathias, and Pete McCloskey – about publishing the documents, on the grounds that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution, but all had refused. Instead, Ellsberg gave the documents to the Times.|$|E
5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative.

5|$|The {{expeditionary force}} left Bombay on 17 September, {{intending}} to rendezvous at Muscat the following week. However, the force was repeatedly delayed during their passage, first with providing escorts to convoys of country {{ships in the}} Arabian Sea and subsequently with rescuing survivors of the Stromboli, which was so rotten that she fell apart in the ocean swell with considerable loss of life. When the force eventually arrived at Muscat in October, Sultan Sa'id informed Wainwright that over 20,000 Bedouin warriors had descended on the coast to join the Al Qasimi. Understanding that a protracted land campaign would be impossible with the forces available, Wainwright <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a series of small}} raids against the principle pirate bases {{in the area of the}} Straits of Hormuz, beginning with Ras al-Khaimah, to the north of the Strait on the Arabian coast.|$|E
60|$|From {{the first}} day of starting, the midshipmen set {{themselves}} to learn something of the language. The idea was Jack's and he pointed out to Hawtry, who was rather disinclined to take the trouble, that it would in the first place give them something to think about, and be an amusement on the line of march; in the second, it would render their captivity less dull, and, lastly, it would facilitate their escape if they should <b>determine</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the attempt.|$|R
