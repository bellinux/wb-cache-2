5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> fashion today. Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E

5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago {{and joined}} the {{chemistry}} group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was {{to figure out how}} to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.|$|E

5|$|The initial budget, at {{approximately}} $140 million, led Evan Almighty {{to become the}} most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
