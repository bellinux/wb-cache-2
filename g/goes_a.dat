5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

25|$|Unlike utility {{ceramics}} {{found in}} such large numbers among {{the debris of}} archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was 'social currency' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves. The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> long way towards explaining {{the high level of}} artistry reached in Classical times.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E

Odin is a project to emulate Win32 on OS/2, superseding the original Win-OS/2 emulation which was based on Microsoft code. Other minor implementations include the MEWEL and Zinc libraries which were intended to implement a subset of the Win16 API on DOS (see List of platform-independent GUI libraries).|$|E

From October until April 1954 she was in series four of Educating Archie, while in December 1953 she also appeared in and directed Cinderella at the Players'; The Times commented that [...] "Miss Jacques as actress, playing a deliciously arch and absent-minded Fairy Queen, <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> long way to retrieve the failure of Miss Jacques as dramatist".|$|E
500|$|A {{month after}} the play opened in London, Formby was the guest star on Desert Island Discs, where one of his choices was his father's [...] "Standing on the Corner of the Street".

On {{the way to the}} theatre to inform Littler, Formby suffered a heart attack, although it took the doctors five days to diagnose the coronary and admit him to hospital. He was treated for both the attack, and his morphine addiction. He stayed in hospital for nine weeks before returning home to Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he announced his retirement.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} True Crime (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by Isaiah Washington). True Crime received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing, [...] "his direction is galvanized {{by a sense of}} second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> shade too far in the latter direction, though." [...] The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55million budget and was Eastwood's worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from White Hunter Black Heart, which had a limited release.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{was tempted}} {{back to work}} by the {{theatrical}} impresario Emile Littler, who offered him the lead role of Percy Piggott in Zip <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Million, a play based on the 1902 novel Brewster's Millions by G. B. McCutcheon; Formby was offered £1,500, plus {{a share of the}} box-office takings. The show premiered at the Coventry Hippodrome in September 1951 before opening at the Palace Theatre, London on 20 October. The Times commented unfavourably, saying that although the audience were appreciative of the play, they [...] "could not conceivably have detected a spark of wit in either the lyrics or the dialogue"; the paper was equally dismissive of Formby, writing that [...] "he has a deft way with a song or a banjo, but little or no finesse in his handling of a comic situation".|$|E
500|$|The passage {{concludes with}} a wry remark from Holly, [...] "I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very {{probably}} be thankful". According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> long way toward redeeming it, and {{is typical of the}} winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E
