40|$|Abstract Background New Zealand has {{relatively}} {{high rates of}} morbidity and mortality from infectious disease compared with other OECD countries, with infectious disease being more prevalent in children compared with others in the population. Consequences of infectious disease in children may have significant economic and social impact beyond the direct effects of the disease on the health of the child; including absence from school, transmission of infectious disease to other pupils, staff, and family members, and time off work for parents/guardians. Reduction of the transmission of infectious disease between children at schools could be an effective way of reducing the community incidence of infectious disease. Alcohol based no-rinse <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> provide an alternative hand cleaning technology, for which {{there is some evidence that}} they may be effective in achieving this. However, very few studies have investigated the effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers,</b> and importantly, the potential wider economic implications of this intervention have not been established. Aims The primary objective of this trial is to establish if the provision of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> in primary schools in the South Island of New Zealand, in addition to an education session on hand hygiene, reduces the incidence rate of absence episodes due to illness in children. In addition, the trial will establish the cost-effectiveness and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the intervention in this setting. Methods/Design A cluster randomised controlled trial will be undertaken to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers.</b> Sixty-eight primary schools will be recruited from three regions in the South Island of New Zealand. The schools will be randomised, within region, to receive <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> and an education session on hand hygiene, or an education session on hand hygiene alone. Fifty pupils from each school in years 1 to 6 (generally aged from 5 to 11 years) will be randomly selected for detailed follow-up about their illness absences, providing a total of 3400 pupils. In addition, absence information will be collected on all children from the school rolls. Investigators not involved in the running of the trial, outcome assessors, and the statistician will be blinded to the group allocation until the analysis is completed.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} measure rates of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> {{use in a}} {{hospital}} entrance foyer four months after a baseline study during New Zealand’s influenza pandemic. Of the 743 people observed over one (summer) day in December 2009, 8. 2 % used the <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser,</b> which was significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) than the 18. 0 % reported in the August (winter) study. Health authorities may need to intensify promotion of hand hygiene to reduce the impact of future influenza pandemic waves. We previously published in Eurosurveillance an observational study on <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> use during the influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic in the southern hemisphere winter of 2009 [1]. This study was on the public and hospital workers using a <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> station in the entrance foyer to the major hospital in New Zealand’s capital city. Pandemic activity in this country subsequently declined dramatically [2 - 3], and {{there was very little}} media coverage of the pandemic during the spring and start of summer. The previous study was limited in that there was no pre-pandemic baseline data for <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> use by the public in New Zealand (NZ), {{and the extent to which}} hand hygiene behaviours have persisted in the post-pandemic period is unknown. Yet these behaviours are relevant given Table <b>Hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> use in a hospital foyer entrance during summer, compared with the key results from a study in winter, Ne...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{counter the}} global {{increase}} in infection-related deaths, infection control has recently developed into an active area of research. Many diseases {{can be prevented}} by infection control. In {{the confines of the}} audiology clinic, cross-contamination by micro-organisms associated with opportunistic infections remains a real concern. Objective: The primary aim {{of the study was to}} ascertain the methods that audiologists in South Africa use to prevent and control the spread of infections during and after consultation with clients. Method: A survey study was conducted, using a self-administered questionnaire. Fifty currently practising audiologists participated in the study. Results: The majority (84 %;  n = 42) of respondents acknowledged the importance of hand hygiene for the purpose of infection control, with 76 % (n = 38) making use of no-rinse <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers.</b> Approximately a third of audiologists wear gloves during procedures such as otoscopy and immittance, and while handling hearing aids. Disinfecting audiological equipment seem to be the preferred choice of infection control, with only 60 % (n = 30) of respondents sterilising audiological equipment after each individual patient consultation. Less than half of the respondents disinfected touch surfaces and toys in the reception area. Conclusions: Based on the results, further education and training should focus on measures implemented in infection control, awareness of possible risk factors at work settings, and vaccination as an effective means of infection control. </span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Interventions to {{increase}} hand washing in {{schools have been}} advocated {{as a means to}} reduce the transmission of pandemic influenza and other infections. However, the feasibility and acceptability of effective school-based hygiene interventions is not clear. Methods A pilot study in four primary schools in East London was conducted to establish the current need for enhanced hand hygiene interventions, identify barriers to their implementation and to test their acceptability and feasibility. The pilot study included key informant interviews with teachers and school nurses, interviews, group discussions and essay questions with the children, and testing of organised classroom hand hygiene activities. Results In all schools, basic issues of personal hygiene were taught especially in the younger age groups. However, we identified many barriers to implementing intensive hygiene interventions, in particular time constraints and competing health issues. Teachers' motivation to teach hygiene and enforce hygienic behaviour was primarily educational rather than immediate infection control. Children of all age groups had good knowledge of hygiene practices and germ transmission. Conclusion The pilot study showed that intensive hand hygiene interventions are feasible and acceptable but only temporarily during a period of a particular health threat such as an influenza pandemic, and only if rinse-free <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> are used. However, in many settings there may be logistical issues in providing all schools with an adequate supply. In the absence of evidence on effectiveness, the scope for enhanced hygiene interventions in schools in high income countries aiming at infection control appears to be limited {{in the absence of a}} severe public health threat. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} for transmission {{of infectious diseases}} offered by the school environment {{are likely to be}} an important contributor to the rates of infectious disease experienced by children. This study aimed to test whether the addition of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> in primary school classrooms compared with usual hand hygiene would reduce illness absences in primary school children in New Zealand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This parallel-group cluster randomised trial took place in 68 primary schools, where schools were allocated using restricted randomisation (1 : 1 ratio) to the intervention or control group. All children (aged 5 to 11 y) in attendance at participating schools received an in-class hand hygiene education session. Schools in the intervention group were provided with alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> dispensers in classrooms for the winter school terms (27 April to 25 September 2009). Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session. The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2, 443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school. Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness (respiratory or gastrointestinal), length of illness and illness absence episodes, and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently (child or adult). We also examined whether provision of sanitiser was associated with experience of a skin reaction. The number of absences for any reason and the length of the absence episode were measured in all primary school children enrolled at the schools. Children, school administrative staff, and the school liaison research assistants were not blind to group allocation. Outcome assessors of follow-up children were blind to group allocation. Of the 1, 301 and 1, 142 follow-up children in the <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> and control groups, respectively, the rate of absence episodes due to illness per 100 child-days was similar (1. 21 and 1. 16, respectively, incidence rate ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 18). The provision of an alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> dispenser in classrooms was not effective in reducing rates of absence episodes due to respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, the length of illness or illness absence episodes, or the rate of subsequent infection for other members of the household in these children. The percentage of children experiencing a skin reaction was similar (10. 4 % <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> versus 10. 3 % control, risk ratio 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 30). The rate or length of absence episodes for any reason measured for all children also did not differ between groups. Limitations of the study include that the study was conducted during an influenza pandemic, with associated public health messaging about hand hygiene, which may have increased hand hygiene among all children and thereby reduced any additional effectiveness of sanitiser provision. We did not quite achieve the planned sample size of 1, 350 follow-up children per group, although we still obtained precise estimates of the intervention effects. Also, it is possible that follow-up children were healthier than non-participating eligible children, with therefore less to gain from improved hand hygiene. However, lack of effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> provision on the rate of absences among all children suggests that {{this may not be the}} explanation. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> in addition to usual hand hygiene in primary schools in New Zealand did not prevent disease of severity sufficient to cause school absence.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} observe the Macbeth effect, the concept that threats to moral purity increase motivations to physically cleanse, and that physical cleansing works to restore moral purity (Zhong & Liljenquist, 2006). The Macbeth effect builds upon the conceptual metaphor theory of embodied cognition, explaining humans’ emotional and cognitive understanding of concepts as metaphors describing physical experience (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003). This study therefore, attempted to examine the metaphor of “morality as purity”, giving meaning to {{the ideas of the}} clean conscience and washing away sin. In the first experiment, 50 participants were randomly assigned to moral, control, or immoral conditions to examine whether threats to moral purity (immoral recall) showed associations to cleansing, providing evidence for the Macbeth effect. The results found no significant differences in <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> usage between moral or immoral conditions of memory recall. A second study was performed to examine whether the act of cleansing, not the amount of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> used, was able to restore moral purity. The results found no differences in the reduction of feelings of immorality for participants who cleansed or did not cleanse. Furthermore, participants who cleansed were not shown to have restored moral purity, where participants in the cleansed conditions were equally likely to engage in further moral restorative behaviours (e. g., volunteerism). The current research furthers the literature on the Macbeth effect and the conceptual metaphor theory of embodied cognition, and may help in understanding the association between morality and cleansing...|$|E
40|$|Coaches, {{athletes and}} {{practitioners}} are keen to employ effective evidence-based interventions and {{strategies in the}} field {{to reduce the risk of}} illness compromising training and competitive performance. Factors affecting immune function and the risk of illness in athletes include: the volume, intensity and load of exercise training, degree of exposure to pathogens, underlying health and medical status of individual athletes, lifestyle behaviours including nutrition, sleep and recovery, and psychosocial issues related to training and competition. Given the lack of specific research studies on elite athletes it is necessary to look more broadly at related disciplines including clinical immunology, general medicine, sports medicine, nutrition, psychology, and exercise physiology. Long term planning by organisations, teams or individual athletes should include a yearly sports medicine consultation, review of primary and secondary vaccination schedules, advice on insect avoidance and malaria prevention, review of allergy and asthmatic conditions, establishing a medical network, and managing team and travel logistics. A dental review should also be considered. Environmental issues include strategies for dealing with jet lag, air pollution, water-based pathogens, thermal stress and culture shock when travelling abroad. The effectiveness of illness prevention or sick packs (containing a gel-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser,</b> medicated lozenges, throat gargle, nasal decongestant, vitamins and minerals, and tissues) for immediate field use has been questioned but these are widely used. Athletes should be educated on coughing etiquette and tissue disposal. In terms of physical or exercise training there are several strategies for limiting the risk of training-induced impairments in immune health, including: increasing the frequency of shorter training sessions, reducing the overall weekly training volume or that of individual sessions, avoiding prolonged intensive sessions, reducing the size of load increments in frequency, volume and intensity, employing shorter rather than longer training macrocycles, implementing sufficient recovery after intense workouts and at the end of a long competitive season or the major competition for the year. There should be a review or debriefing session after competition involving medical, scientific and management staff, a written report of the medical events of the season and/or main competition, referral of athletes experiencing long-term or recurrent/persistent illness for medical review, and early preparations for the following season. A combination of experimental research addressing both efficacy (laboratory) and effectiveness (field) of interventions and strategies, emerging technologies, and the hard-earned clinical and practical experience of physicians, athletes and coaches, will pave the way for improved management of illness in athletes...|$|E
