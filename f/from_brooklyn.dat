5|$|Girlfight is a 2000 American sports drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Karyn Kusama and starring Michelle Rodriguez in both of their film debuts.

5|$|The former Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) also {{planned a}} {{railroad}} tunnel, for freight use, between Brooklyn and Staten Island in 1893. The PRR also proposed a tunnel <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> to Jersey City, approximately following the planned {{path of the}} Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, ten years later. The project was never started, despite efforts by government planners to start the project from the 1920s through the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} funded through tuition, grants, and donations. The {{majority}} of students come from middle-class families <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn.</b> The private school has sliding-scale tuition, and less than half pay full tuition. Founding director Alan Berger said that 20 percent paid full tuition in 2012. In 2015, about a third paid less than $500 in tuition, and another third paid half tuition. The sliding scale's full tuition is set at $22,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters {{from the}} Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), {{at that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn,</b> Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> to New Jersey, some {{involving}} a tunnel to Staten Island. These included {{an option for}} a tunnel directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the plan}} would benefit the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad opposed it, and the railroad, {{cooperating}} with the Port Authority, proposed a tunnel <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> to Greenville, New Jersey, with a spur to Staten Island. The situation become complicated, as the Port Authority plan {{was approved by the}} State Legislatures in both New Jersey and New York. In addition, the Transit Commission proposed its own subway tunnel branching from the Fourth Avenue Line to be operated as part of the city's subway system.|$|E

Their {{daughter}} Caroline {{was born in}} December 1925. Dorothy feuded with Youngs' mother, however, and the couple separated before the birth of Caroline, whom he never met. Youngs was considered friendly and generous, loaned money constantly, and was reportedly owed $16,000 {{at the time of}} his death ($ in current dollar terms). Youngs enjoyed playing golf and was considered the best golfer in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 13 Nobel laureates {{affiliated}} with the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY considers any laureate who attended one of its senior colleges as an affiliated laureate. Arthur Kornberg, who graduated from the City College of New York, a senior college of CUNY, in 1937, was the first CUNY laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959. Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle, both of whom graduated from the City College in 1937 with Kornberg, jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985, the only CUNY laureates to do so. Six CUNY laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, {{more than any other}} category. Ten of the CUNY laureates graduated from the City College, two laureates, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Gertrude B. Elion, graduated from Hunter College, another CUNY senior college, and one laureate, Stanley Cohen, graduated <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> College, one of CUNY's senior colleges, in 1943.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, October 6, {{the grand}} jury heard {{testimony}} from Joseph Langdon, {{the crew of the}} Lucinda, and a carman <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn.</b> At 9am, {{the grand jury}} presented five bills of indictment against Jackalow: the murder of Jonathan Leete; the murder of Elijah Leete; the robbery of Jonathan Leete; the robbery of Elijah Leete; and running away with the Spray. Voorhees was joined by lawyer Isaac R. Wilson, of New York City, for Jackalow's defense. Jackalow pleaded not guilty to each count. On the motion of U.S. Attorney Cannon, a special term of the circuit court was appointed to meet in Trenton, on the third Tuesday in January, to try the case.|$|E
5|$|Sofy Alvarez-Bareiro, a {{high school}} student <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn,</b> New York, {{assisted}} the President in gazing at the moon through a telescope. She explained to the President that craters on the moon were caused by impacts from space materials. The Russellville, Alabama-based group Russellville City Schools Engineering Rocket Team attended the event and were personally recognized by President Obama. Team members Chelsea Suddith, Katie Burns, Niles Butts, Andrew Heath, Cristian Ruiz, Cady Studdard and Evan Swinney were requested by the President to stand at the event and speak to the crowd about the rocketry accomplishments, which included achieving victory among contestants at the 2015 International Rocketry Challenge at the Paris Air Show. The students were able to meet celebrities who attended the event, including: Bill Nye, and MythBusters co-hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn,</b> who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the goals}} of Mayor John Hylan's Independent Subway System (IND), {{proposed}} in the 1920s was a line to Coney Island, reached by a recapture of the BMT Culver Line. To connect this line to the Eighth Avenue Line–the main trunk of the IND–a subway line was to run <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Borough Hall south under Jay Street, Smith Street, Ninth Street, and several other streets to Cortelyou Road (later Church Avenue) and McDonald Avenue, just north of the Ditmas Avenue elevated station. A ramp would then lead onto the elevated BMT Culver Line. This line was variously known as the Culver Line Extension, Culver−Smith Street Line, Smith Street Line, Smith Street–Prospect Park Line, Smith–Ninth Street Line, Jay–Smith–Ninth Street Line, Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Coney Island Line, Brooklyn Line, or South Brooklyn Line, though it was often simply referred to as the Brooklyn portion of the IND. As originally designed, service to and from Manhattan would have been exclusively provided by Culver express trains, while all local service would have fed into the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|The American {{plan was}} that Putnam would direct the {{defenses}} <b>from</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their {{troops would be}} stationed on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell {{back to the main}} defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, {{in the center of the}} American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Road farthest to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights farther to the east called the Jamaica Pass, which was defended by just five militia officers on horses.|$|E
