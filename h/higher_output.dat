5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a <b>high</b> <b>output</b> {{performance}} of a Ka-band monolithic HEMT Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO). This VCO has a sub-resonator {{in order to avoid}} reduction in Q-factor of a resonator. Circuit elements of the sub-resonator are optimized to achieve a wide tuning range as well as <b>high</b> <b>output</b> power and low phase noise performances. In addition, an AlGaAs/InGaAs double-hetero struc­ture High Electron Mobility Transistor(HEMT) is employed in the VCO to obtain a <b>high</b> <b>output</b> per­formance. A <b>high</b> <b>output</b> power of 19. 4 dBm has been achieved at an oscillation frequency of 36. 2 GHz. This performance has been achieved without any buffer amplifiers. A tuning range of more than 2. 5 GHz is also obtained with a stable <b>high</b> <b>output</b> power. To our knowledge, this represents the high­est output power of monolithic VCO without any buffer amplifiers...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of fluid}} and {{electrolytes}} from a <b>high</b> <b>output</b> ileostomy (> 1200 ml/day) can quickly result in dehydration {{and if not}} properly managed may cause acute renal failure.

This enables licensed amateur operators to legally use <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> power for wireless devices and allows for longer-range communications. Such communications can be used to assist in emergency communications and disaster relief operations and in everyday amateur radio communications.|$|E
25|$|At the {{national}} level, this trend {{could reduce the}} attraction of new investments and preclude Camisea's <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> needed for the regional economic development. On the other hand, Peru continues to encourage community development and environmental protection based on social responsibility and sustainable development principles. In spite of this strategy, the mineral industry {{continues to be the}} target of social protest due to mining operations' impact on livelihood resources. These events have affected the image of the mining industry and caused growing concern about the regional climate for mining investments.|$|E

25|$|Shure is {{credited}} with several industry firsts. In 1948, the company introduced the 900MG, the first phonograph cartridge capable of playing both long-playing and 78 rpm records, and in 1954, Shure's M12 Dynetic Phono Reproducer tonearm and cartridge set established an industry standard with a tracking force of only one gram. The M1 Studio Dynetic Cartridge introduced the principle of a moving magnet within a stationary coil, an engineering concept that dominated cartridge design for nearly 25 years due to its <b>higher</b> <b>output,</b> lower noise, and greater headroom. The Shure M3D, introduced in 1958, was the first ever stereo moving magnet cartridge, with 20dB of stereo separation at 20kHz.|$|E

25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E

25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane avgas. By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war the 11.1 {{continued}} with a larger 1400 cc engine and standard electric lighting as the 11.9 until 1923 and the updated 12 until 1926. Following Wilbur Gunn's death in 1920, three existing directors headed by Colin Parbury took charge. The first of the company's sports models was launched in 1925 as the 14/60 with a twin-cam 1954-cc 4-cylinder engine and hemispherical combustion chambers. The car was designed by Arthur Davidson who had come from Lea-Francis. A <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> engine came in 1927 with the 2-litre Speed Model which could be had supercharged in 1930. A lengthened chassis version, the 16/65, with 6-cylinder 2.4-litre engine, was available from 1926 to 1930. The final car of the 1920s was the 3-litre using a 2931-cc 6-cylinder engine. This continued until 1933 when the engine grew to 3181 cc and was also available with a complex 8-speed Maybach transmission as the Selector Special.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A <b>higher</b> <b>output</b> voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
