Jockeying for power became more fierce. More factions now allied themselves with the princess and Maru. The Maha Dewi–Maru faction was firmly in power by the early 1380s when the king's health rapidly declined. By 1382, she was the de facto ruler. The main opposition to her rule would come from her nephew and adopted son Binnya Nwe in 1383.|$|E
2500|$|Lawford {{was born}} c. 1756 {{and entered the}} navy at an early age. He served during the war with America, and was first {{lieutenant}} aboard the 90-gun [...] at the Battle of the Saintes. In October 1788 he commissioned the brig [...] and commanded her {{for the next two}} years. Lawford then took command of the 16-gun sloop [...] during the Spanish Armament and was stationed initially in the English Channel, before departing for Jamaica on 22 October 1790, where he spent the next two years. He was promoted to post-captain on the outbreak of war with France in 1793, and took command of the newly captured 36-gun [...] He sailed as an escort for a convoy to Britain on 5 February the following year, but his command was short-lived as Convert was wrecked three days later on a reef off the East End of Grand Cayman; the wreck later referred to as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. While court martialled {{as a result of the}} shipwreck, Lawford was acquitted and the event did not adversely affect his career. [...] Lawford remained in service to the Royal Navy and in January 1798 took command of the 64-gun [...] His time aboard her was brief, and in March <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to Captain John Bligh and took up command of Bligh's old ship, the 50-gun [...]|$|E
2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and laid it on the desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E
