5|$|Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly {{demonstrated}} by the Crimean War, along with Australia-wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's <b>defence</b> <b>posture.</b> The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss {{to report on the}} defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence {{in the hands of the}} Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400-ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.|$|E

In this article, we present our vision for this solution.

I begin by outlining the development of Volunteering in Britain and New Zealand before 1885. The roles of the Volunteer Force in the defence of New Zealand, and in local communities are studied in some detail. A study is also made of the type of men who joined, and some conclusions are reached as to why they became involved in the Movement. Particular attention is devoted to the structure and operation of Volunteer corps. The weaknesses of the Volunteer system are studied in some detail, as are the resultant limitations on the Force's military effectiveness. The composition and activities of the Force over the period are surveyed and related to changes in New Zealand's <b>defence</b> policy and <b>posture.</b> Finally, the nature of the Volunteer Movement is analysed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} each of Australia’s defence white papers issued between 1976 and 2013 and seeks to draw out common themes that emerge in {{some or all of}} them. Executive summary 	Australia published defence white papers in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2009 and 2013 and a new white paper is expected in 2015. 	A community consultation process was undertaken as part of the 2000 and 2009 defence white papers and a similar process is being carried out for the upcoming 2015 defence white paper. 	The need to defend Australia against a major aggressor remains the primary driver in Australian defence policy. 	Regional security and contributing to the global order have been secondary, but still important priorities in Australian defence planning. 	Each of the defence white papers has been created on the basis that Australia should be able to defend itself against a potential aggressor without outside assistance (the principle of self-reliance), {{while at the same time}} stressing the importance of the alliance with the United States. 	Threat perceptions have changed from the Cold War influences reflected in the 1976 and 1987 white papers to a contemporary focus on terrorism while also incorporating emerging threats such as cyber attacks and the rise of China. 	Defence white papers are not produced in a vacuum but are informed by key reviews of Australia’s strategic situation, industry policy and force <b>posture.</b> 	<b>Defence</b> policy is subject to the broader economic conditions of the time and the Department of Defence must contend with many other priorities for government funding. 	The financial plans set out in the various defence white papers are often ambitious and rarely brought to fruition. 	On the whole, capability choices have displayed continuity between the different white papers regardless of changes in government. This is understandable given the length of time required for major capital equipment acquisitions. 	Recent white papers have placed a greater emphasis on regional engagement. 	The contribution of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, as well as to border protection activities, has also been included in the most recent white papers...|$|R
40|$|Labor {{has moved}} to review {{national}} defence and security policies, but will it break substantially with the Howard era, asks GEOFFREY BARKER THREE fundamental reviews of national defence and security policy have been ordered by the Rudd government as the Australian Defence Force conducts ongoing high-tempo military operations abroad and continues a multi-billion dollar rearmament and expansion program at home. Labor’s reviews are dictated partly by the new government’s desire to differentiate itself from the Howard government on national security policy, partly by the increasingly complex and changing regional and global threat environments now facing Australia, and partly by the high and rising costs of defence. The new Defence White Paper commissioned by Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon will provide new and overdue foundations for 21 st century national strategic policy. The review of air combat capability is Labor’s response to ongoing controversy surrounding the decisions by the Howard government to spend $ 16 billion dollars on up to 100 F- 35 joint strike fighters and $ 6 billion on 24 Super Hornet fighters. And the review of Australia’s homeland and border security arrangements has been ordered to establish whether or not Australia needs a separate {{department of homeland security}} in an age of Islamist terrorism, globalised crime and global warming. While Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon are understandably anxious to develop and own distinctively Labor defence and security policies, {{it remains to be seen}} how substantially different their policies will be when the reviews are completed. Before coming to power Rudd committed Labor to maintaining defence spending (currently running at $ 22 billion annually) with minimal annual real growth of three per cent. While he pledged to spend money more efficiently, he accepted that Australian military forces had to be able to operate both regionally and globally in coalitions. So he acquiesced in Howard government defence policy parameters to the extent of insulating defence from funding cuts. Moreover, Labor faces the same regional and global problems that faced the Coalition: the deterioration of Australia’s strategic circumstances in the south-west Pacific, a changing global balance of power with the rise of China and India, and the wider threat from Islamist militancy. The scale and diversity of these problems limit the space for immediately apparent policy shifts. Finally, Australia’s military and civilian defence establishment has always been extremely good at protecting its role and its perquisites. Labor, like the former government, will not dare (and will not want) to ride roughshod over Defence as it pursues policy adjustments. Some things will of course change this year. Australian combat troops will come out of Iraq. Military high command personnel will change with the expiration of the employment contracts of the Defence Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, and the army, navy and airforce chiefs. There will inevitably be differences in ministerial style and substance and emphasis as Fitzgibbon, still somewhat unknown, settles into his new job. But many familiar defence issues will not change: Australian troops will remain at risk on potentially hazardous operations in Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. The US alliance will remain central to Australian security policy. There will be an ongoing need to understand Australia’s current and future threat environment and to structure Australian military forces appropriately. The ten-year $ 50 billion program to acquire new planes, warships and advanced land warfare equipment will continue, with many key decisions on fighter aircraft and new warships already made and being implemented. Also remaining will be the problems of recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel needed by a modern defence force, and of ensuring that Australia’s defence industry base is capable of developing, repairing and sustaining military equipment. (Labor, like the coalition, is committed to selling the government-owned ASC - formerly the Australian Submarine Corporation - shipyard to private industry this year). Despite Labor’s claims that it inherited a Defence mess, the Howard government in some ways left the ADF better funded and better equipped and better managed than it was under the previous Labor government. Under the pressure of global and regional events, and alliance obligations, the ADF was also much busier with its deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. But after early efficiency and acquisition reforms, the Coalition found itself struggling to overcome continuing waste and mismanagement, delay and cost overruns in sometimes contentious procurement decisions, and critical shortages of skilled people in some areas. Overall, the Coalition’s greatest failing was its reluctance to take a fully considered long view of Australia’s changing strategic environment, including how to develop, equip and structure forces for the future within the nation’s financial capabilities. It preferred to throw money at Defence and to respond reactively to events in tandem with the US and other allies. At various times it embraced radical and contentious doctrines - including preemptive attacks - and it could not quite resolve the sometimes dubious tensions between advocates of so-called regionalist and globalist <b>defence</b> <b>postures.</b> Howard had no less than five defence ministers. By far the most important of Labor’s policy reviews designed to remedy this situation will be its new defence White Paper, due to be completed in December. It will be first defence White Paper for eight years, although the Howard government published three slim “updates” in 2003, 2005 and last year. The White Paper will attempt to assess Australia’s strategic environment out to 2030 and the likely forces and equipment that will be needed to respond cost-effectively to that environment. It will involve judgements about regional and more remote threats from state powers as well from as non-state actors including Jihadist terrorists and criminal organisations, and from phenomena including global warming. The principal author will be Defence deputy secretary Michael Pezzullo, a tough, bright and ambitious bureaucrat who wrote last year’s “update” for the Howard government. As a strategic analyst Pezzullo clearly straddles the regionalist-globalist policy divide. In last year’s update he defined Australia’s “area of paramount defence interest” in specifically regional terms, but also said “we [...] . recognise that our interests often must be secured in places distant from Australia. ” This is in line with both Coalition and Labor policy. The White Paper will expand on the air, sea and land forces, equipment and the financial resources required to defend national interests in the environment that is likely to evolve over the next two decades. Whether Australia ought to move towards acquiring ballistic missiles, and how far it ought to become involved in US anti-missile defence technologies, will be tough questions for Pezzullo and his advisers. The brute facts of geography dictate Australia’s need for superior regional air combat and air-strike power. As the 2000 White Paper noted: “Air combat is the most important single capability for the defence of Australia because control of the air over our territory and maritime approaches is critical to all other types of operation in the defence of Australia. ” Labor’s air combat capability review will look at the adequacy of current air combat planning to the year 2045 in the light of critical, highly expensive and quite opaque decisions taken by the Howard government. Stage one of the review will examine the Howard government’s decision to retire Australia’s diminishing fleet of ageing F- 111 aircraft in 2010 and to acquire 24 F/ 18 Super Hornet fighters for some $ 6 billion. Stage two of the review will look at emerging trends in Asia-Pacific combat air power and the Howard government’s decision to purchase up to 100 American F- 35 Joint Strike Fighters for $ 16 billion. It will also consider the case for and against acquiring F- 22 Raptor aircraft. The Howard government’s decisions to acquire the Joint Strike Fighters and the Super Hornet appeared to be taken with little prior warning or public discussion despite their formidable cost. There have been long-simmering controversies, often promoted by commentators with an apparent id©e fixe, over the decisions to retire the F- 111 s and not to seek US government permission to purchase Raptors. The review will conducted by Defence first assistant secretary for police development, Neil Orme and is due to be complete by the end of April. The ubiquitous Mr Pezzullo will chair a steering committee. Current speculation is that the review will eventually back the decisions to retire the F- 111 s and to acquire the Super Hornets. It is unlikely to support acquisition of Raptors, despite Fitzgibbon’s declaration at recent US-Australia ministerial talks in Canberra that he wants to have the option of purchasing the advanced high-performance planes. Critical decisions for the review may revolve around the timing, cost and number of joint strike fighters Australia will need in a future air force armed with Super Hornets equipped with advanced radars and stand-off missiles. The homeland security review, to be conducted by former Defence secretary Ric Smith, will examine whether Australia needs a separate super-department for homeland security to deal primarily with terrorist threats. It will review the roles and responsibilities and coordination of counter-terrorism, federal police and customs agencies. Indications so far are that the Rudd government is not attracted to setting up a separate homeland security administration but that it is looking to Smith for advice on how better to coordinate the national domestic security effort. The White Paper and the air combat and homeland security reviews have to be seen as coordinated Labor initiatives to assert political, intellectual, policy and financial over the defence and security legacy of the Howard government. They are sensible and necessary initiatives that show Labor is very serious indeed about getting defence and national security right. But it would be very surprising if the eventual outcome was a radical redefinition of the nature of the threat environment and the optimal force structure needed to address it over time. • Geoffrey Barker is a senior columnist with the Australian Financial Review and a frequent contributor to APO.

50|$|Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly {{demonstrated}} by the Crimean War, along with Australia-wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's <b>defence</b> <b>posture.</b> The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss {{to report on the}} defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence {{in the hands of the}} Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400 ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.|$|E
50|$|South Africa began {{acquiring}} {{large quantities}} of NATO arms in 1960, after the Sharpeville Massacre prompted the African National Congress to abandon their traditional non-violent tactics in favour of armed struggle. The government was initially dependent on its largest trade partner, the United Kingdom for arms, spares, and munitions; however, this preference was disrupted by British revulsion at South Africa's domestic and foreign policy. Although British legislation restricting the transmission of certain types of technical armaments to South Africa barely affected the SADF's <b>defence</b> <b>posture,</b> it spurred diversification efforts, as the regime purchased arms from France, West Germany, Italy, Jordan, and Switzerland during the 1964-1977 period. In 1964 a Belgian licence was obtained for South African manufacture of the FN FAL battle rifle; a year later, {{a modified version of}} this weapon and its ammunition was being manufactured in Pretoria's assembly plants. Similarly, Italy granted a licence for production of an advanced trainer, the Aermacchi MB-326. Armscor also purchased systems abroad which were designed to SADF specifications. The most prominent of these were the Mirage III series of fighter aircraft, which were modified in France for South African requirements. Armscor's predecessor, the Munitions Board, had also imported the AML-60 and AML-90 armoured scout cars from France. The vehicles saw action against Cuban T-34-85 tanks in Angola during Operation Savannah, and the Mirage III and F1 interceptors became the mainstay of the South African Air Force (SAAF).|$|E
5000|$|Scherger was {{the first}} to go to the CAS post with a bit of class; the others {{approached}} it in a registered, a pedestrian fashion. There was a strain of ruthlessness in Scherger; he would not spare you if his interests and yours conflicted. Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett [...] Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as one of [...] "the outstanding officers of the post-war era" [...] and [...] "among the RAAF's better chiefs", Scherger is credited with helping to shift Australia's <b>defence</b> <b>posture</b> to the north by developing the concept of a series of front-line air bases in the continent's top end, beginning with plans for RAAF Tindal in 1959. [...] From the time of his command of No. 10 Operational Group, he had an easy rapport—and worked to foster relations—with the US military, presaging closer defence ties with the Americans that he pursued as CAS. Among other things this manifested itself in the purchase of more and more US equipment for the Air Force, and far less from the United Kingdom. [...] Once elevated to the position of Chairman of COSC, he further severed ties with Britain by removing senior Royal Australian Navy officers from the Royal Navy List, and dropping the words [...] "... and Chief of the Australian Section of the Imperial General Staff" [...] from the title of Chief of the General Staff in the Australian Army List.|$|E
5000|$|The ditch {{is lined}} with {{concrete}} on both the scarp and counterscarp faces. It has on both faces a slight batter of three degrees from the vertical. The depth varies from 25 ft. to 30 ft. maximum and the width at the base also varies, being wider on the rear (long north east to south west) face and at its narrowest on the southern and northern flanks. It is 15 ft. wide. There are no caponiers or counterscarp galleries in the ditch, the only known major British Defence work to adopt a purely passive <b>defence</b> <b>posture.</b> There is much evidence of the 1907 siege works in this ditch, three of the counter-mine shafts still survive, now mostly covered up with debris and rubbish (post 1962). Near the RSJ which spans the moat are seen five massive cracks and more repair work, again from the siege trials of 1907, but this time, {{the hole in the}} base of the ditch was not dug by the defenders but {{was the result of a}} failed [...] "camoflet" [...] or [...] "petard". Accounts vary as to the title of the device used, but it was a type of tunnel driven from the attacker's side along the length of the moat to here and exploded. The first left the now mostly back-filled crater but at the second attempt blew a section of the wall outwards causing the damage still to be seen.After the sale of Fort Luton to Kent County Council the ditch fell into rapid disuse and became an illegal dump for all manner of refuse. A great pile of debris has been allowed to build up beneath and to either side of the drawbridge and beneath the RSJ. The disuse of the ditch has also caused much growth of vegetation.|$|E

40|$|At the moment, very {{substantial}} {{reforms in the}} field of security are being undertaken in Japan. “The New National Defence Program Guidelines for 2005 and After”, as well as the “Midterm Defence Program Fiscal Year 2005 - 2009 ” both talk about a thorough restructuring of the Self Defence Forces to make them able to respond effectively to new threats, such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, as well as provide a more proactive Japanese policy with various initiatives to improve the international security environment. There is a definite strengthening of the Japanese-US security relation, where Japan is being asked to and is willing to take a bigger role. The declaration by North Korea that they now possess nuclear weapons is considered an imminent threat to Japan. This, in connection with the abduction issue (see below) is played up in Japanese mass media and is being used by certain groups to create changes in Japan’s <b>defence</b> <b>posture.</b> These are changes that the Japanese consider necessary to counter the larger threat in the long term, the rise of China. This paper will start with a short historic overview of the Japanese <b>defence</b> <b>posture</b> since World War II and give a short presentation of the kinds of threats Japan feels it is facing since September 11, 2001, and in the future. Then we will continue with Japanese-North Korean relations, and Japanese-Chinese relations. The recent strengthening of the Japanese-US security cooperation, and its implications for Japanese <b>defence</b> <b>posture,</b> as well as regional cooperation, will be covered. We will conclude with what these changes imply for Europe, as well as the role Europe could play in securing peace and stability in Asia.
