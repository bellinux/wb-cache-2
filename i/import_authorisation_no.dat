50|$|An {{extraordinary}} minister (Latin: minister extraordinarius) of {{a sacrament}} is someone, {{other than an}} ordinary minister, officially authorised to administer a sacrament by the law itself (as an instituted acolyte is an extraordinary minister of holy communion) or by being deputed for this purpose. If an extraordinary minister of a sacrament administers it illicitly, the sacrament is effective, but the person ministering could be liable for an ecclesiastical penalty, such as an interdict. By way of example, an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion is authorised to bring Holy Communion within a particular parish or diocese.

40|$|It {{is likely}} that Grotius was {{influenced}} by knowledge {{of the practice of}} the courts in the Netherlands in his easy recognition of third-party rights. This may perhaps be seen in his Inleidinge tot de Hollandsche Rechts-geleerdheid, where the departure from the firm Roman rules is justified in terms of a preference for billickheid over scherpheid van rechten, reflecting Martinus Gosia’s favouring of aequitas over strictum ius and also the aequitas canonica used to ground a third party’s claim in the Grand Conseil of Malines in the sixteenth century. By contrast, the treatment of the subject in the De Iure Belli ac Pacis was strongly influenced by the analysis of Covarruvias, whose Relectio on the Sext 1. 18. 2 was cited by Grotius in the margin of his text. The normal rule, as for Covarruvias, was that a contract was created by the acceptance of a promise, and it did not matter whether the acceptor was present or absent. Against this background Grotius dealt with three distinct situations raising the controversial issue of third-party rights. First was the simple pactum in favorem tertii, where one person accepted a promise in his own name for the benefit of another. Roman law would have said that the acceptor obtained a right only if he had an interest, but Grotius stated that this was no longer the law. The acceptor therefore received a right which he could transfer to the third-party beneficiary, provided that he also accepted it. In the meantime, the promisor could not unilaterally revoke the promise, though the acceptor (in whom the right was vested) had the power to release it. Second was the case of direct representation, where a person had been mandated to accept a promise in another’s name. Roman law had restricted direct representation to slaves and others in the potestas of the beneficiary, but, said Grotius, this restriction no longer existed and anybody might be authorised by another to accept a promise on their behalf. In such a case the right vested immediately in the person on whose behalf the promise had been accepted. Third was the situation where acceptance was made {{in the name of the}} beneficiary, but by a person acting without <b>authorisation.</b> <b>No</b> right vested in the beneficiary until he had himself accepted the promise, but neither, it seems did any right vest in the acceptor. None the less, until the beneficiary had accepted or rejected the promise the promisor had no power to revoke the promise, nor did the acceptor have any power to release it – he had not received the promise for his own benefit or on his own behalf, and it would be contrary to good faith were it to be released. Alongside this, Grotius dealt with the donatio sub modo, applying the same principle as he had identified as lying behind the pactum in favorem tertii and saying that a burden placed on the donee of a gift in favour of a third party could be revoked so long as it had not been accepted by the third party. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|However, REACH regulates {{only the}} use of SVHC within the European Economic Area (EEA). This holds also true for uses in articles. Art. 3 No 3 REACH defines the term ‘article’ as ‘object which during {{production}} is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function {{to a greater degree}} than does its chemical composition’. Most products used e.g. in private homes such as furniture, textiles, toys, books or electronic devices are, therefore, covered [12]. Besides, the term may refer to complex articles (e.g., bicycle) and also to their constituent parts where these parts meet the article definition (e.g., bicycle tube) [13]. Whenever the producer of an article incorporates SVHC outside the EEA, Art.  56 (1) REACH does not apply. As a consequence, such articles may be imported into the EEA subject to the requirements of Art. 7 REACH, but there is <b>no</b> <b>authorisation</b> requirement for REACH Annex XIV SVHC contained.

The railway settled down to running coal trains for Tilmanstone Colliery as its only profitable activity. The colliery company objected to its rates, and opened an aerial ropeway in competition to the Eastern Arm of Dover Harbour in 1930.

40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{irregular}} migrant workers, i. e. unlawfully or lawfully present foreigners who engage in employment although not legally authorised to do so, poses a challenge for national social security policy. The challenge is twofold. First, irregular work by foreigners is usually undeclared work, i. e. work for which no social security contributions and taxes are paid. Second, irregular migrant workers may be confronted with the realisation of a social risk, such as the loss of income due {{to the birth of}} a child or the need for health care. This poses the question for social security of how to deal with people who have <b>no</b> <b>authorisation</b> to work in the country, and possibly also <b>no</b> <b>authorisation</b> to reside there. Preliminary investigations have shown that both legal science and national legislators struggle with this question. The doctoral research of Klaus Kapuy sought to contribute to the current legal discourse on the social security status of migrants in an irregular situation. It was the aim of the research to come up with suggestions on how to treat irregular migrant workers in national social security law by deploying a method which has not hitherto been used in legal research: an analysis of social security law itself. In order to understand the mechanisms of social security law better, the author has not only looked at the treatment of irregular migrant workers, but also at the treatment of a reference group. The reference group the author identified consists of nationals whose work is not declared to social security authorities. The comparison between irregular migrant workers and undeclared national workers has been conducted in three different countries (Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands) and the results of the country investigations have been compared between the three countries. In order to better understand the results of the analysis of national law and to ascertain the legal limits of any proposal on the legal position of irregular migrant workers, the author also investigated the existing international legal framework in this field. This approach has proven to be beneficial. The analysis of national and international law has produced some interesting insights, which have allowed Klaus Kapuy to elaborate a proposal for a coherent social security policy towards irregular migrant workers. The policy proposal is based on the idea that the objectives and logic of social security should be decisive in determining the status of irregular migrant workers in national social security law, although without undermining the objectives of immigration law and without contravening international legal obligations. status: publishe...|$|R

This amount is sufficient to irrigate about a further 432 km 2 every year.
