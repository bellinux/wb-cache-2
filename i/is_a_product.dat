5|$|H2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of {{some types}} of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|In a dystopian {{critique}} of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of an individualistic drive of the Reformation, {{yet at the}} same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism.|$|E
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that of the nation-state. The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the tradition of clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church, although hereditary descent from uncles to nephews is also seen in the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|E

5|$|Polonium-210 {{in tobacco}} {{contributes}} {{to many of}} the cases of lung cancer worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from lead-210 deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of radon-222 gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of radium-226 from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Sengoku {{period from}} the mid-15th to early 17th century {{was a time}} of nearly continual {{military}} conflict. Powerful military lords known as daimyo, such as Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi or Tokugawa Ieyasu, struggled to unify Japan. During the Sengoku period, because of constant warfare, a large number of fortifications and castles were built. Archetypal Japanese castle construction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the Momoyama period and early Edo period.|$|E
5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E

5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of combustion {{of organic}} matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary {{for it to be}} a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. Geothermal energy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|Gardein (a {{portmanteau}} {{of garden}} and protein) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> line of meat-free foods made by Garden Protein International in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2014, Pinnacle Foods purchased Gardein for $154 million. Founder Yves Potvin stayed {{on with the}} company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are vegan, and they are certified by Vegan Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified Kosher pareve by Kosher Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC). In 2014, they added gluten-free beefless products to their range {{in response to the}} expanding gluten allergy market.|$|E
5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and {{the popularity of the}} extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
