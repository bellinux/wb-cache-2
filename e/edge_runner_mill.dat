The hydraulic press was invented by Joseph Bramah in 1795; the expression outlet of his press was based on the traditional oil mill method with filter cloths. At the end of the 19 th century German companies produced hydraulic cage presses, with rams pressing the seeds inside of vertical slotted barrels that did not require filter cloths [29].

40|$|The Sugar Industry, the Sugarcane Roller Mill and Sino-Portuguese Relations {{from the}} XVIth to XVIIIth Centuries. Many {{questions}} have been raised with respect to the origins of the rolling mill, type of sugarcane mill which by replacing the ancient technology of the <b>edge</b> <b>runner</b> and the beam presses in the xvnth century helped to speed up the process by which sugar cane is crushed and thus to favor the boom in the world sugar industry. This paper reexamines this question since it has come to light {{in the past few years}} that the promoters of this invention could be, in fact, the Chinese. A detailed comparison between the Chinese mill and the Brazilian mill shows, on the one hand, that the two machines are quite distinct and suggests, on the other hand, that problems with regard to technological innovation cannot be treated without taking into account the specific social context of each society. Thus for example in China, sugar, which has been produced long before it had in Europe, was not valued on the same basis as in Europe. Furthermore in China white sugar was not so much appreciated until the XVIth cen- tury. The evolution of its status seems linked to the pressures of the international market, after China had come into contact with her Asian neighbors via the Portuguese. At the end of the XVIth century, the Chinese sugar provinces of Guangdong and Fujian are going to produce very white sugar specially for exportation and if the clientele is rapidly satisfied it is because the Chinese possess technique for sugar whitening claying which the Portuguese will only introduce into the West later on. Between the xvith and xvnth century the Chinese sugar activity will experience an unprecedented development, but will rapidly lose energy, without resulting in more advanced stage of industrialisation. Traditional networks of production of artisanal and unrefined sugar meanwhile will continue to function. Sabban Françoise.

50|$|The grain {{is lifted}} in sacks onto the sack {{floor at the}} top of the mill on the hoist.

The <b>milled</b> grain (flour) is collected as it emerges through the grooves in the runner stone from the outer rim of the stones and is fed down a chute to be collected in sacks on the ground or meal floor.

The race proved to be a highly controversial one. Forest Flower seemed to be boxed in two furlongs from the finish, and her rider Tony Ives, in extricating the filly from her unfavourable position, bumped into Minstrella, who was clearly hampered. Minstrella was unable to recover and was beaten two and a half lengths. Reid immediately lodged an objection to the winner, but the racecourse stewards ruled that the interference had been accidental and left the result unaltered. After decision Evans reportedly told Nelson [...] "We've been robbed here". Minstrella's connections then took their case to the disciplinary committee of the Jockey Club, who overturned the original decision, ruling that Ives's manoeuvre had constituted intentional interference. Minstrella was awarded the race whilst Forest Flower was disqualified and placed last. Timeform described the decision as [...] "unjust", but pointed out that the committee had acted correctly according to the rules of racing.

40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviour}} of a pump-turbine, in turbine mode, {{was investigated}} {{at part load}} both experimentally and numerically, {{in the attempt to}} achieve a more comprehensive knowledge of the complex phenomena that occur in such conditions.

The experimental results showed that recirculation phenomena occur in two zones: the first close to the leading <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner,</b> the second downstream of the <b>runner</b> trailing <b>edge.</b> The appearance of backward flows is linked with a net exchange of torque which reduces the one transmitted by the fluid to the rotor and has a significant effect on the characteristic curves of the machine. The numerical results confirmed only partially the ones obtained experimentally: the simulations detected the presence of an extended area of recirculated flow downstream of the runner, even if at a flow rate lower than the one obtained by experiments. The recirculation upstream of the runner was detected by the fluid dynamic code more clearly when the conveyor vanes were inserted. Finally, the numerical results confirm the deviation of the internal characteristic from the line of the theoretical one due to the presence of recirculations...|$|R
5000|$|On {{his fourth}} and final {{appearance}} of the season Casamento was sent to England for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse, and again had a new jockey, with Frankie Dettori riding the colt.

The most fancied of the six British trained <b>runners</b> were Titus <b>Mills</b> (Stardom Stakes) and Native Khan (Solario Stakes). Casamento raced behind the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs out and held off the sustained challenge of Sevile to win by three-quarters of a length with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Master of Hounds in third.

40|$|New {{installations}} of unregulated {{power to}} the electrical grid have led to more fluctuations in the grid frequency. Hydropower plants with large reservoirs can provide services to balance the frequency by increasing or reducing production in accordance to what is needed. However, such balancing services are putting stress on the turbines by exposing them to dynamic loads. In the recent years, several high head Francis turbines have {{been taken out of}} operation due to cracks in the runner. It is thought to be because the turbines are not designed with sufficient measures to handle all the types of dynamic loads appearing during variations in operation. Analysis of stresses caused by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is therefore of increasing interest in the hydropower industry. In this thesis, pressure and strain measurements have been performed on the Francis test rig in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The results were further used as validation of a FSI analysis conducted on the same turbine model in the software program ANSYS. The rotational speed of the runner was decreased by 60 rpm over a time period of 2 seconds to illustrate how an estimated change in grid frequency impact stresses in the turbine. The results from the FSI simulation showed high stresses both on the leading and trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner</b> blades, where the maximum stress was found on the trailing edge tip towards the shroud. A decrease in runner speed resulted in a decrease in material stresses. At the end time, the maximum equivalent stress has a magnitude of 5 MPa, which is way below the yielding limit for the material. Validation of the CFD simulation showed sufficient correlation between the measured and simulated pressures. However, it was difficult to achieve a comparison of strain results with the strain gage, and the FSI results should therefore be further validated before they can be used as background for more research...|$|R
40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the energy market {{in the recent years}} has lead to an increased willingness to operate hydro turbines over a larger operational range and with increased number of start and stops. This means that the turbine will be subject to a more frequent and larger load variation. Especially for high head turbines, the impact of dynamic forces has been of considerable interest. High head turbine runners are subjected to dynamic forces originating from various sources. One significant source is the interaction between the runner and guide vanes, also called rotor - stator interaction (RSI). RSI creates periodic pressure fluctuations in the runner. Combined with stress concentration and material defects, the induced pressure fluctuations can give an increased risk of fatigue cracks. For Francis runners, the areas near the trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>runner</b> blade towards the band and/or crown has been identified as critical areas for fatigue, and for high head runners there has been several examples where fatigue failure have been initiated near the trailing edge toward the band. The thesis presents an estimation of dynamic stresses in a high head Francis runner. The stresses were estimated by Finite Element analysis based on pressure variations obtained via unsteady CFD analysis. The dynamic stresses calculated by FEA were compared with dynamic stresses measured by strain gauge measurements carried out on a prototype runner. A CFD result for one operational condition was calculated. Since the pressure variations on the blades are periodic, only a pressure load for one whole cycle is needed for the FEA. Symmetry between the number of runner blades and guide vanes made it possible to reduce the computational model and thereby reduce computational time. The Finite Element model contained a portion of the crown and band and two runner blade channels. The FEA was carried out for time steps corresponding to a full periodic cycle for one operational condition, i. e one guide vane opening angles. The results were compared with site measurements.
