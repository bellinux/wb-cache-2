5|$|<b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> book, and I {{was totally}} stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E
500|$|Production for {{the film}} began in February 2006, with a budget of $20–25 million. Principal {{photography}} {{for the film}} was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew [...] "had to rush" [...] to meet the February 16 deadline. The film was directed by Nickelodeon's Rugrats co-creator and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gábor Csupó, who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it [...] "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó stated that {{he was interested in}} making the film because he [...] "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he [...] "didn't like anything until <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> book". He described the book as [...] "beautiful" [...] and said that it [...] "moved [...] ". Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman's final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; [...] "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life".|$|E

500|$|Prior to its release, Batgirl #1 {{sold out}} at the {{distribution}} level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with Action Comics #1, Justice League #1, Batman #1, Batman and Robin #1, [...] #1, Detective Comics #1, Flash #1, Green Lantern #1, and Superman #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly states {{in a review of}} the first issue: [...] "The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone’s script tries to tie up {{of the end of the}} previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [...] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl." [...] The New York Times critic George Gene Gustines wrote: [...] "Unlike some of the other DC comics <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series." [...] Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone [...] " [...] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{write this}} novel, Grimwood did {{extensive}} research into brain surgery and epilepsy. Film producer William Castle {{took an interest}} in adapting Breakthrough for a movie, but the project was never realized. Breakthrough has certain parallels with David Williams' Second Sight (Simon and Schuster, 1977), coincidentally written the same year and later adapted for the TV movie, The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan (1979). Williams has commented, [...] "As the author of Second Sight, I {{have to tell you that}} until <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> Wikipedia page in 2004, I had never heard of Ken Grimwood or his novel Breakthrough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morris's {{argument}} involves {{close reading}} of the pre-NLRA administrative cases, and then the successive drafts of the NLRA. ... I was not convinced. While I agree that the NLRB should have required employers to meet with organizations representing {{only a fraction of}} their workforce, I do not find a clear Congressional command that requires the Board to do so. Morris shows that, at several stages in the drafting process, such clear language was briefly part of the bill, but was later deleted as part of a general process of simplifying language and delegating detail to the new NLRB. Drafters similarly rejected a proposal that would clearly have restricted the duty to bargain to majority representatives. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> history to mean that Congress delegated this issue, along with many others, to the new NLRB.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Richard Matheson and Carol Serling {{produced}} an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet-unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines {{for such a}} production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script ("Where the Dead Are") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. Serling showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. [...] "I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> one right away and, after 30 pages, called my partner and said, [...] "I love it," [...] recalled O'Hara. [...] "This is pure imagination, a period piece, literate – some might say wordy. If Rod Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't {{have a chance at}} getting made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} he wrote the highly {{regarded}} Pilot episode in his boxer shorts. [...] "I {{had no idea what}} would come of it and there was just that purity to it." [...] The script for the Pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project, including film star Peter Gallagher, who said of the Pilot, [...] "In that recently post-9/11 America, <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>this</b> script and thought it was astounding. I thought it was exactly the right story to be telling at that point in time. It was about a family living in a not very embracing community, one that doesn't necessarily share all their values. [...] they don't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help. They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid. And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia, a kind of looking-over-your-shoulder and getting small and angry, sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act-fueled environment. This espoused a kind of America... It just felt right. And it had a sense of humor." ...|$|E

It's not to say that people can't be happy or find bliss in a relationship. It's just amazing to me how unhappy most people are and they can't shake it and can't fix it, much like an addiction."
