5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.

5|$|For {{addition}} of sulfur ylides to enones, higher 1,4-selectivity is typically obtained with sulfoxonium reagents than with sulfonium reagents. Many electron-withdrawing groups <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> {{compatible with the}} reaction including ketones, esters, and amides (the example below involves a Weinreb amide).

5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to be continuously collinear, meaning that they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them {{are in the same}} sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit bodies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to {{have significant}} antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts {{have been made}} to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
