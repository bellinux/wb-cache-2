40|$|Abstract— ‘ Manufacturing Backend ’ is a {{software}} tool {{that is used}} to test the performance of a printed circuit board and store the related information in a centralized database which can be accessed easily. The setup contains seven computerized stations where each station performs a unique task in testing of a printed circuit board. Each printed circuit board is identified by a barcode which is read using a barcode scanner. There are totally seven stations and printed circuit board undergoes testing at each station. The tests that are carried out are voltage test, <b>impedance</b> <b>test</b> and sanity test. The information regarding each test is stored in a centralized database. The centralized database is accessible at all the stations. After the printed circuit board undergoes all the tests, it is cased and once again subjected to a functionality test. It will then be packed and ten such cased boards will be placed in a carton for shipping. The carton is identified by a new barcode and also contains barcodes of the ten boards. During the course of the series of tests, if any PCB is found to be defective, it is rejected. This tool is completely automatic. Since a centralized database is used, it reduces the overhead of storing and retrieving data for future use which makes it a versatile tool.

40|$|Vertical {{impedance}} measurements provide significant {{quantitative information}} {{about the ability of}} concrete cover to slow the penetration of chloride ions that can corrode steel reinforcement in a bridge deck [1]. The primary limitations preventing the widespread adoption of vertical impedance for assessment of concrete bridge decks are (1) the necessity to have a direct electrical connection to the embedded steel reinforcement and (2) the low speeds of data acquisition. This work presents solutions to both limitations. In previous work, our group developed a vertical <b>impedance</b> <b>testing</b> apparatus that was used to collect data from a continuously moving platform in the field [2]. While that apparatus greatly increased the speed of data collection, it required a direct electrical connection to the reinforcing steel; making a direct electrical connection to the rebar generally requires drilling through the concrete surface and tapping the reinforcing steel, which is a time-consuming process and therefore a major limitation to rapid data acquisition. In this work, a method using a large area electrode as a reference electrode for vertical <b>impedance</b> <b>testing</b> is proposed and validated using numerical finite-element simulations to demonstrate how a direct rebar connection can be eliminated. Based on these successful simulations, this work additionally reports how a large area electrode was constructed and incorporated in a continuously moving platform. When used in a multichannel arrangement, the use of a large area electrode allows rapid measurements of a full lane width of a bridge deck in a single pass. This development simplifies the entire vertical <b>impedance</b> <b>testing</b> process and greatly reduces the total time necessary to obtain measurements. Field data, including comparisons to direct electrical connections, demonstrate the utility of this technique and its general applicability to impedance-based measurements for quantitatively assessing the ability of the concrete cover to protect the reinforcing steel from corrosion...|$|R
