40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>scaling,</b> {{fundamental}} task {{of numerous}} image processing and computer vision applications, {{is the process}} of resizing an image by pixel interpolation. <b>Image</b> <b>scaling</b> leads to a number of undesirable image artifacts such as aliasing, blurring and moiré. However, with {{an increase in the number}} of pixels considered for interpolation, the image quality improves. This poses a quality-time trade off in which high quality output must often be compromised in the interest of computation complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive study and comparison of different <b>image</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithms. The performance of the scaling algorithms has been reviewed on the basis of number of computations involved and image quality. The search table modification to the bicubic <b>image</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithm greatly reduces the computational load by avoiding massive cubic and floating point operations without significantly losing image quality...|$|R

30|$|<b>Image</b> {{transformation}} and <b>scaling</b> are techniques {{widely used in}} digital television industry. Leelarasmee [21] gives the architecture for a TV sign image expander with closed caption encoder. It allows nine <b>image</b> <b>scaling</b> factors ranging from 1 × 1 to 2 × 2. Hutchison et al. [22] present application of multimedia display processor which provides a cost effective and flexible platform for many video processing algorithms, including <b>image</b> <b>scaling.</b> In order to overcome the problems such as blurring and jagging around the edges, Liang et al. [23] propose a coordinate rotation and kernel stretch strategy combined with the bilinear or bicubic algorithm. Transformation of image captured by camera {{is one way of}} document digitization. Stamatopoulos et al. [24] present a goal-oriented rectification methodology to compensate for undesirable document image distortions. Their approach relies upon a coarse-to-fine strategy. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) implementation of <b>image</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithm is presented by Chen et al. [25]. Other types of image transformations can be found in [26 – 28].|$|R

This description, extracted from a training image, can then {{be used to identify}} the object when attempting to locate the object in a test image containing many other objects. To perform reliable recognition, {{it is important that the}} features extracted from the training image be detectable even under changes in <b>image</b> <b>scale,</b> noise and illumination. Such points usually lie on high-contrast regions of the image, such as object edges.|$|E
50|$|The BTA primary is a 605 cm f/4 mirror. This is a {{relatively}} slow primary compared to similar instruments; the Hale is a 5 m f/3.3. The telescope optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope design, albeit without the traditional Cassegrain-style focus. Due to its large primary, the <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> at the prime focus is 8.6 arc seconds per millimeter, {{about the same as}} the Cassegrainian focus of a 4 m telescope. This eliminates the need for a secondary, and instead the observing instruments are placed at the prime focus. For secondary roles, two Nasmyth foci can be used, with an effective f/30.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescope}} {{uses the}} heliostat {{at the top}} of its main tower to direct the sun's light down a long shaft to the primary mirrors. The distinctive diagonal shaft continues underground, where the telescope's primary mirror is located. The theoretical resolution of the main telescope is 0.07 arcsec, although this is never reached because atmospheric distortions degrade the image quality severely. The <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> is 2.50 arcsec/mm at the image plane. Since 2002 the National Solar Observatory staff have developed an adaptive optics system designed for the unique needs of solar observatories that dramatically improve the resolution of science images.|$|E
40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>scaling,</b> {{particularly}} by powers of two, {{has previously been}} shown as implemented efficiently by direct manipulation of coefficients in the frequency domain. Typically, these coefficients are computed via the 8 x 8 DCT, or other block transforms, for their compressed storage in popular standard formats such as JPEG or MPEG. Many existing implementations of these <b>image</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithms use coarse fixed-point approximations for the floating point constants required by their definitions. This paper demonstrates application of a new methodology to approximate the floating point constants needed to perform scaling down of an image in the frequency domain. Our fixed-point implementation is a multiplierless and relatively precise (as shown by PSNR) implementation of the algorithm and is suitable for applications, such as high speed and high resolution color printing, where the visual quality of the resulting <b>scaled</b> <b>image</b> cannot be compromised.
