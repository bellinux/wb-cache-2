5000|$|Podilymbus is a genus {{of birds}} in the Podicipedidae family, {{containing}} the extinct Atitlán grebe (<b>Podilymbus</b> <b>gigas)</b> and the pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps). [...] The genus name is derived from Latin Podilymbus, a contraction of podicipes ("feet at the buttocks", from podici-, [...] "rump-" [...] + pes, [...] "foot")—the origin {{of the name of}} the grebe order—and Ancient Greek kolymbos, [...] "diver".|$|R
50|$|The {{pied-billed grebe}} (Podilymbus podiceps) is {{a species of}} the grebe family of water birds. Since the Atitlán grebe (<b>Podilymbus</b> <b>gigas)</b> has become extinct, it is the sole extant member of the genus Podilymbus. The pied-billed grebe is {{primarily}} found in ponds throughout the Americas. Other names of this grebe include American dabchick, dabchick, Carolina grebe, devil-diver, dive-dapper, dipper, hell-diver, pied-billed dabchick, pied-bill, thick-billed grebe, and water witch.|$|R
50|$|The Atitlán grebe (<b>Podilymbus</b> <b>gigas),</b> {{also known}} as giant grebe, giant pied-billed grebe, or poc, is an extinct water bird, a {{relative}} of the pied-billed grebe.

It was described in 1929 by Ludlow Griscom based on a specimen collected in 1926 and had been overlooked in the past. American ecologist Anne LaBastille observed the decline of this species over a period of 25 years. It was declared extinct by 1990.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} Larus gulls, {{they are highly}} predatory and {{frequently}} hunt and kill any prey smaller than themselves, behaving more like a raptor than a typical larid gull. Lacking the razor-sharp talons and curved, tearing beak of a raptor, the great black-backed gull relies on aggression, physical strength and endurance when hunting. When attacking other animals, they usually attack seabird eggs, nestlings or fledgings at the nest, perhaps most numerously terns, but also including smaller gull species as well as eiders, gannets and various alcids. In Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, 10% of the stomach contents of great black-backed gulls {{was made up of}} birds, while a further 17% of stomach contents was made up of tern eggs alone. Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked. Some fully-fledged or adult birds observed to be hunted in flight or on the ground by great black-backed gulls have included Anas ducks, ruddy ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis), buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), pied-billed <b>grebes</b> (<b>Podilymbus</b> podiceps), common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), terns, Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica), coots (Fulica ssp.), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), glossy ibises (Plegadis falcinellus) and even rock pigeons (Columba livia). When attacking other flying birds, the great black-backed gulls often pursue them on the wing and attack them by jabbing with their bill, hoping to bring down the other bird either by creating an open wound or simply via exhaustion. They will also catch flying passerines, which they typically target while the small birds are exhausted from migration and swallow them immediately. Great black-backed gull also feed on land animals, including rats (Rattus ssp.) at garbage dumps and even sickly lambs (Ovis aries).|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} scale on habitat use for three wetland-obligate bird species with divergent life history characteristics and possible scale-dependent criteria for nesting and foraging in South Dakota, USA. A stratified, two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select survey wetlands within strata defined by region, wetland density, and wetland surface area. We used 18 -m (0. 1 ha) fixed radius circular-plots to survey birds in 412 semipermanent wetlands during the summers of 1995 and 1996. Variation in habitat use by pied-billed <b>grebes</b> (<b>Podilymbus</b> podiceps) and yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), two sedentary species that rarely exploit resources outside the vicinity of nest wetlands, was explained solely by within-patch variation. Yellow-headed blackbirds were a cosmopolitan species that commonly nested in small wetlands, whereas pied-billed grebes were an area-sensitive species that used larger wetlands regardless of landscape pattern. Area requirements for black terns (Chlidonias niger), a vagile species that typically forages up to 4 km away from the nest wetland, fluctuated in response to landscape structure. Black tern area requirements were small (6. 5 ha) in heterogeneous landscapes compared to those in homogeneous landscapes (15. 4 – 32. 6 ha). Low wetland density landscapes composed of small wetlands, where few nesting wetlands occurred and potential food sources were spread over large distances, were not widely used by black terns. Landscape-level measurements related to black tern occurrence extended past relationships between wetlands into the surrounding matrix. Black terns {{were more likely to}} occur in landscapes where grasslands had not been tilled for agricultural production. Our findings represent empirical evidence that characteristics of entire landscapes, rather than individual patches, must be quantified to assess habitat suitability for wide-ranging species that use resources over large areas...|$|R

Information on habitat use of the American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and a statistically valid survey design for monitoring changes in populations of inconspicuous marsh birds, which include American and Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis), Pied-billed <b>Grebes</b> (<b>Podilymbus</b> podiceps), Soras (Porzana carolina), and Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola)) is needed to inform conservation and management actions. My research, from 1999 - 2002, examined breeding habitat use and home range of American Bitterns. Also, I used pilot survey data to guide design options to meet objectives for monitoring marsh bird occupancy rates in association with habitat changes. Nest sites of American Bitterns in wetlands (n = 47) and grasslands (n = 33) were positively associated with percent dead vegetation cover and density and negatively associated with vegetation height. Foraging sites of American Bitterns were negatively associated with distance to small water openings and vegetation height. Daily survival rate was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 930 - 0. 979) and nest survival rate of American Bitterns was 0. 35 (95 % CI = 0. 15 - 0. 58). The average core home range size (50 %) was 18. 08 ha ([plus or minus] 6. 38) and the 95 % home range was 109. 28 ha ([plus or minus] 38. 47) using the fixed-kernel estimator.

40|$|Wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) provide {{important}} breeding habitat for greater than 30 species of waterbirds. Approximately 70 % of PPR wetlands {{have been lost}} since European settlement and remaining wetlands are subjected to frequent degradation, primarily due to agricultural activities. Horned grebes (Podiceps auritus) are experiencing long-term population declines and are listed as a species of Special Concern in Canada. Because {{there is virtually no}} information on the status and trends of pied-billed <b>grebes</b> (<b>Podilymbus</b> podicep) this species is also of considerable conservation concern. Grebes are recorded on the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Surveys (WBPHS) conducted annually in May by the Canadian Wildlife Service; however, how accurately these counts reflect actual abundance has been unknown. Using a repeated counts method in 2010 and 2011, estimates of detection probabilities averaged 0. 48 and 0. 18 for horned and pied-billed grebes, respectively. These results suggest that WBPHS ground surveys may be used as an efficient and effective management tool for monitoring horned grebe abundances. However, low detection rates for pied-billed grebes lend little support for including the species in future monitoring efforts using the WBPHS. I recommend that the Canadian Wildlife Service consider implementing standardized ground survey methods to facilitate annual monitoring of horned grebe abundances. Marshbird research has focused primarily on breeding habitat use or selection but has seldom examined how productivity is related to wetland characteristics. Understanding processes that affect distribution patterns and productivity of grebes could provide insights into actions needed to achieve conservation goals. Therefore, occupancy of wetlands by breeding and brood-rearing horned and pied-billed grebes was evaluated on 6 - 7 study sites (5. 8 - 11. 6 km 2) in south-central Saskatchewan, 2010 and 2011, and related to wetland and upland habitat features. Wetland occupancy by grebes was influenced by interspecific competition as well as local and landscape-level wetland features. Horned and pied-billed grebes rarely co-occurred on smaller (≤ 4 ha) semi-permanent and permanent wetlands. At the wetland level, horned grebe occupancy and productivity were highly correlated with the amount of emergent vegetation, whereas wetland area alone was a better predictor of adult pied-billed grebe occupancy and productivity. At a landscape level, the number of semi-permanent, permanent, and artificial wetlands on each study site was an important predictor of breeding and brood-rearing wetland occupancy probability for horned grebes in 2010 and for pied-billed grebes in both years. However, breeding horned grebe occupancy probability and productivity were higher in low wetland density landscapes in 2011. Horned grebes may be opportunistic, exploiting more of the available wetland habitats in low wetland density landscapes during years of above-average water conditions. Conservation initiatives for grebes should consider the roles of wetland-specific and landscape-level features while protecting semi-permanent and permanent wetlands in landscapes characterized by both high and low wetland densities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeat Shock Protein 70 (HSP 70) are generalist stress {{proteins}} {{expressed in}} response to numerous environmental stresses.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1992 Waterbird use {{and aquatic}} {{vegetation}} were studied during seven seasons and in five units representing three water types at Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS), 1 July 1990 - 30 June 1991. Dominant vegetation types were cover-mapped and sampled for species composition, biomass, and stem density. The PH, salinity, turbidity, and water depth measurements also were taken at appropriate vegetation plots. The five study units represented, a saline basin (Klopp Lake) {{filled with water}} from Humboldt Bay, a freshwater unit (Butcher Slough Log Pond, BSLP) filled with well water; and three freshwater units filled with treated domestic wastewater effluent. The PH was greatest in the units in late spring except BSLP where it was highest in late fall. Salinity was greatest in Klopp Lake in mid fall. All four freshwater units had salinities of less than one ppt. The BSLP was significantly less (p< 0. 05) turbid than the wastewater units from late fall through summer. Dominant vegetation types included marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), lesser duckweed (Lemna minor), broad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia), hard-stemmed bulrush (Scirpus acutus), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus). Marsh pennywort and lesser duckweed also commonly occurred as understory species in the emergent cover types. Mean stem densities of broad-leaved cattail and hard-stemmed bulrush were greatest in summer and were greater in the wastewater units (p< 0. 05) than in BSLP. Biomass of sago pondweed was greatest in all freshwater units during mid fall. BSLP maintained submergent beds later into the fall than the wastewater units. The wastewater units developed heavy mats of lesser duckweed over most of their surfaces in the fall. Coverage of marsh pennywort mats peaked in early fall in Gearheart Marsh and BSLP and in summer in Allen and Hauser Marshes. Ninety-four species of birds were recorded. There was an annual total of 768, 586 bird use-days on the five units. Almost 1 / 3 of the annual bird use-days occurred during late fall. Shorebirds (58. 1 percent) and waterfowl, coots and rails (35. 2 percent) accounted for 93. 3 percent of annual bird use-days. Lowest bird use occurred in summer. Bird densities were greatest on Klopp Lake for diving ducks, large and small shorebirds, gulls, and terns. Based on relative area use, great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) used Klopp Lake at greater than expected rates. BSLP and Allen, Gearheart, and Hauser units had similar patterns of annual bird use. Densities were greatest on these units for herons, egrets, puddle ducks, coots, rails and raptors. Annually, fish-eating divers, represented mostly by some resident pied-billed <b>grebes</b> (<b>Podilymbus</b> podiceps) used BSLP more than either Klopp Lake or the wastewater units. Black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) used BSLP at more than twice expected rates but other herons used BSLP at less than expected rates. Cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) were most common on BSLP. The wastewater units were used at or more than 1. 5 times than expected rates by herons, all puddle ducks, dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Bonaparte's gulls (Larus philadelphia). The lesser scaup (Avthya affinis) was the only diving duck present on the wastewater units at expected or greater than expected rates. American coots (Fulica americana) and rails used all four freshwater units at least 1. 5 times more than expected. Continued annual marsh pennywort removal is strongly recommended, and guidelines should be established to stop encroachment of emergent vegetation into open water and submergent beds. If possible, a freshwater source should be routed into Klopp Lake to reduce high salinities and to allow for possible introduction of additional aquatic vegetation into the water column. An alternative to freshwater would be to introduce eelgrass (Zostera marina) into Klopp Lake...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 D and 2 D 1 H NMR {{studies of}} the Fe 4 S 4, cluster {{containing}} ferredoxin I from Desulfovibrio africanus {{have been carried out}} with the aim of determining the geometry of the cluster linkages with the 4 Cys side chains that bind the cluster. This required the Cys βCH resonances of the oxidised protein to be sequence-specifically and stereo-specifically assigned, and this was accomplished by a combination of TOCSY and NOE measurements, allied to model building based on X-ray structures of related ferredoxins. An analysis of the estimated hyperfine shifts of the Cys βCH resonances with a Karplus-type equation relating the shifts to iron-sulfur-β carbon-/ 3 proton dihedral angles, taken together with the relative relaxation rates of the two βCH 2 resonances, estimated from their linewidths, then allowed the ironsulfur-/ 3 -carbon-α-carbon dihedral angles to be determined. A novel representation of the NMR data is presented which shows that the cluster dihedral angles are uniquely determined by the NMR data. The analysis reveals that the dihedral angles for D. africanus ferredoxin I are similar to the corresponding angles of other ferrredoxins even though there are differences in their 1 H NMR spectra. The sequence-specific and stereospecific assignments have been extended by analogy to the related Fe 4 S 4 -containing D. <b>gigas</b> ferredoxin <b>I,</b> and the stereospecific assignments to the Fe 4 S 4 -containing Thermococcus litoralis ferredoxin...|$|R
