60|$|In {{the general}} debates on Mr. Disraeli's Reform Bill, my {{participation}} {{was limited to}} the one speech already mentioned; but I made the Bill an occasion for bringing the two great improvements which remain to be made in Representative Government, formally before the House and the nation. One of them was Personal, or, as it is called with equal propriety, Proportional Representation. I brought this under the consideration of the House, by an expository and argumentative speech on Mr. Hare's plan; and subsequently I was active in support of the very <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute</b> for that plan, which, in a small number of constituencies, Parliament was induced to adopt. This poor makeshift had scarcely any recommendation, except that it was a partial recognition of the evil which it did so little to remedy. As such, however, it was attacked by the same fallacies, and required to be defended on the same principles, as a really good measure; and its adoption in a few Parliamentary elections, as well as the subsequent introduction of what is called the Cumulative Vote in the elections for the London School Board, have had the good effect of converting the equal claim of all electors to a proportional share in the representation, from a subject of merely speculative discussion, into a question of practical politics, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
60|$|Case-hardening is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of case-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute.</b> To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of leather, hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|E

Not so in Italy, where the formal provision of care from private structures (such as those organised by religious orders) is often considered an <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute,</b> given their lower average quality and higher average costs (Del Boca et al. 2005). On the contrary, grandparents’ involvement in childcare is widespread, more intense when children are small and/or do not attend day care. This support is essential to ease the integration of mothers into the labour market when formal care provision is missing or insufficient, as school hours are short {{with respect to the}} standard working day and access to part-time positions is inadequate (Ichino and Sanz de Galdeano, 2005; Del Boca et al. 2005; Keck and Saraceno, 2008).|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{incomplete}} cartels in quantity-setting oligopolies may increase welfare, without any efficiencies or synergies being internalized by cartel formation. The main intuition {{is that the}} cartel has an incentive to contract output and that the firms outside the cartel react to this by expanding output. If the outsiders are more efficient than the cartel firms, average production costs go down. We model collusion in a market structure with <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute</b> goods. Even for relatively moderate differences in efficiency, total welfare may increase due to this market-induced rationalization, whereas the cartel remains profitable. We discuss why the effect can be relevant for sectors where new, superior products are developed.

30|$|When {{we look at}} {{labour demand}} {{aggregated}} over all formal qualification groups (but disaggregated by year, task and experience), we estimate an overall inverse elasticity of substitution between migrants and natives of 0.0622, which corresponds to an elasticity of roughly 16. The task-specific elasticities of substitution {{are in the range}} between 9.6 and 14.4. These estimates are close to the threshold between perfect and <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes</b> which frequently in the literature is assumed to be at a value of 10 (though sometimes higher values are still considered as <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes).</b> We find that migrants and natives are better substitutable in manual routine tasks and somewhat worse substitutable when carrying out interactive tasks. However, when we consider only aggregates over all qualification levels, {{it is not clear whether}} the elasticities really reflect the substitutability between migrants and natives. These estimates may be affected to some extent by the different assignment of migrants and natives to qualification groups.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} large {{overlapping}} generations model with individuals that differ across age, productivity and native status to assess the effects on the pension system of different immigration quotas {{in the context of}} an aging population by computing how much should social security taxes be rised in order to pay for the pension burden in two model economies. The first one is the standard model pioneered by Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) where skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes in the production process. In the second model economy, individuals with different skill levels are <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes</b> as in Canova and Ravn (1998). The main result of the paper is that half of the reduction of the social security tax rate associated with immigration in the standard model is lost when skilled and unskilled individual are <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes.</b> Consequently, the standard model with perfect substitution overestimates the ability of immigration inflows to sustain the pension system in Spain. ...|$|R
40|$|The Armington Assumption in {{the context}} of multi-regional CGE models is {{commonly}} interpreted as follows: Same commodities with different origins are <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes</b> for each other. In this paper, a static spatial CGE model that is compatible with this assumption and explicitly considers the transport sector and regional price differentials is formulated. Trade coefficients, which are derived endogenously from the optimization behaviors of firms and households, are shown to {{take the form of a}} potential function. To investigate how the elasticity of substitutions affects equilibrium solutions, a simpler version of the model that incorporates three regions and two sectors (besides the transport sector) is introduced. Results indicate: (1) if commodities produced in different regions are perfect substitutes, regional economies will be either autarkic or completely symmetric and (2) if they are <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitutes,</b> the impact of elasticity on the price equilibrium system as well as trade coefficients will be nonlinear and sometimes very sensitive.

The analysis assumes dealcoholized wine is an <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute</b> for traditional wines.

The results suggest that alcohol content of wine positively influences consumers׳ preferences and that dealcoholization generates aversion. Consumers tend to buy dealcoholized wine only for a discount proportional to the reduction in alcohol content. The target group for dealcoholized wine is younger, infrequent consumers, label readers, and people with alcohol dependency problems. Policy implications concern the fact that dealcoholized wine should not be labeled or marketed as a wine and that actions aimed at increasing consumer confidence toward this new product should be implemented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the methodological problems {{to define a}} modelling approach {{to assess the impact}} of full or limited bilateral liberalisation of agricultural trade flows in the Euro-Mediterranean region. The bilateral trade liberalisation process in the region is framed by complexity, in policy instruments and in the characteristics of the products, in particular fruits and vegetables. Advantages and disadvantages of the general equilibrium and partial equilibrium approaches to simulate trade policy impacts are assessed. Caveats of existing models are related to the representation of specific policy instruments (tariffs, entry prices and other non-tariff measures) and on the seasonal nature of horticultural trade, which is of major importance in the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Are. The paper provides an illustration of how an <b>imperfect</b> <b>substitute</b> product model could be helpful to describe the trade effects of bilateral price changes, for given seasons. ...|$|E

The labour market is characterised by union wage setting, and a fixed exchange rate implies wage rigidity and involuntary unemployment. The long run effects on instantaneous utility, employment and the stock of real and financial capital of a revenue neutral increase in the tax on fossil fuels combined with a) lump sum rebating or b) change in the labour income tax rate, are discussed. Due to the changes in instantaneous utility during the time path following {{the implementation of the}} tax reform, the total welfare effect may be positive even with a reduction in long run consumption.
