I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Bosnian media, {{political}} parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical. The Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz described the report as {{an attempt by the}} Bosnian Serb government to deny that genocide had taken place. The Srebrenica and Zepa Mothers Association condemned the report as [...] "false, [...] shameful and utterly amoral." [...] The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina denounced it as [...] "yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2." [...] Alija Behmen, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, called it [...] "a surprising forgery which is trying to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH. Negating the genocide cannot {{be a part of the}} election campaign." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Roth Cornet {{awarded the}} episode a 6.9, {{denoting}} a [...] "okay" [...] episode. She called the episode [...] "the real {{beginning of the}} end". Cornet, however, was critical of the episode's length, specifically pin-pointing the Philadelphia scenes, noting that they [...] "went on too long". She concluded that [...] "I feel for the writers, who <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> were forced to stretch their content this season", {{as well as for}} the episode. Nick Campbell of TV.com was unhappy that the episode did not show or comment on Pam and Jim's fight in the previous episode. He felt that the beginning of the dinner scene was nice, due to the two's banter. However, he felt that the end pretended as if they had not discussed the move in any previous episodes. Campbell felt that Odenkirk was used in a good way, but that was [...] "a waste of amazing talent at the real estate office". He also felt that Dwight and Angela's kiss was a good progression for their story.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Hayward {{kept his}} promise to Smith, [...] "He is a {{religious}} man and I told him I would pledge him what he asked of me to say. I pledged it to him, although if <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> it, <b>I</b> would say it, and satisfy myself, and it was this: 'Oh, God, for Christ's sake, forgive me for my sins.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|O'Brien did {{not seriously}} respond {{for several days}} after the announcement, then drafted a press release {{explaining}} why {{he felt it was}} unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he [...] "cannot participate in what <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> is [...] destruction." [...] O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, while Leno received heavy criticism. On January 21, O'Brien signed a $45 million deal allowing him to leave the network, and aired his final episode of Tonight on January 22; Leno returned as host of Tonight on March 1.|$|E
2500|$|For 60 {{years the}} Tonight Show has aired {{immediately}} following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into {{the next day to}} accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t the Tonight Show. [...] So it has come to this: I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting this program and what an enormous personal disappointment it is for me to consider losing it. My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show. But I cannot participate in what <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> is its destruction.|$|E
2500|$|Warwick {{weathered}} the British Invasion {{better than most}} American artists. Her UK hits were most notably [...] "Walk On By" [...] and [...] "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" [...] In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by British singers Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Dusty Springfield, most notably Black's [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick even met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: [...] "I told her that [...] "You're My World" [...] would be my next single in the States. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believe</b> that if I'd sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed on hers too. There was no imagination in her recording." [...] Warwick later covered two of Cilla's songs - [...] "You're My World" [...] appeared on Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, released in 1968 and on the soundtrack to Alfie.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I have {{misunderstood}} your father," [...] Francis, declared, [...] "and I {{admit that}} I have, {{it has been}} to some extent his own fault. To me he was always the deliberate scoffer against any code of morals, a rebel against the law even if not a criminal in actual deeds. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> that The Walled House {{was the scene of}} disreputable orgies, that your father was behind Fairfax in that cold-blooded murder, and that he was responsible in some sinister way for the disappearance of Reggie Wilmore. Most of these things seem to have been shams, like the fight last night." ...|$|R
5000|$|The UN Human Rights Committee is now {{one hundred}} percent {{partisan}} in favour of abortion and never takes account of the hugely damaging effects of abortion on both mother and baby.

500|$|She survived {{this first}} suicide attempt after lying unfound in a crawl space for three days, later writing that she [...] "blissfully {{succumbed to the}} {{whirling}} blackness that <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> was eternal oblivion." [...] She spent {{the next six months}} in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment under the care of Dr. Ruth Beuscher. Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith Scholarship were paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty, who had successfully recovered from a mental breakdown herself. Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college. In January 1955, she submitted her thesis, The Magic Mirror: A Study of the Double in Two of Dostoyevsky's Novels, and in June graduated from Smith with highest honors.|$|R
5000|$|Roth is {{open about}} {{his use of}} cannabis. As stated in an {{interview}} conducted and filmed by DJ Vlad, Roth explained his views about the legalization of cannabis: [...] "Cigarettes don't {{do anything for you}} except kill you... <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> don't <b>believe</b> marijuana is the gateway drug, because I use it, and I've never done anything else... I'm trying to be open about my pot smoking." ...|$|R

Most of the French schools, and all the schools here, drive the students to work for their own credit, {{and for the sake}} of their pride. I was told that all the world was interested in my work, and everybody at Kami's talked turpentine, and <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> that the world needed elevating and influencing, and all manner of impertinences, by my brushes. By Jove, I actually believed that! When my little head was bursting with a notion that I couldn't handle because I hadn't sufficient knowledge of my craft, I used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting ready to astonish the world.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Dyer later made a {{statement}} saying:I have not commented earlier because I {{was in the middle}} of a Test match and was trying to concentrate on it and also because I, and the Australian team management, felt it would have been inappropriate to comment on umpiring decisions... Given that the ball initially hit my left glove and ended in my right glove, I made a gesture of query to the umpires. However, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>believed</b> at the time of the incident, as did my captain and my teammates, that the ball had not touched the ground. One angle of slow motion TV replay apparently indicates that the ball had in fact touched the ground. In the circumstances I can understand Andrew Jones being upset, but I would like Andrew, along with all other interested parties, to know that I acted in good faith.Alan Border said, [...] "I had no doubt whatsoever it was taken and I got a shock later when I saw the replays.
