The fusion processing is based on centralized fusion system. The application of <b>data</b> level <b>fusion</b> is limited because of the matching pixel-accuracy.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{sophisticated}} recent <b>data</b> <b>fusions</b> in remote sensing has involved the use of LiDAR and hyperspectral <b>data.</b> Feature-level <b>fusion</b> strategy is applied based on extraction of several recent proposed spectral and structural features from hyperspectral and LiDAR data, respectively. In order to optimize classification performance, feature selection and determination of classifier parameters are carried out simultaneously. Referring to complexity of search space, cuckoo search as a powerful metaheuristic optimization algorithm is applied. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the overall classification accuracy up to 6 % with respect to only hyperspectral imagery. The obtained results show the classification improvement for the tree, residential and commercial classes is about 4 %, 21 % and 35 %, respectively...|$|R

25|$|The P-8 {{features}} the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar; the P-8I features an international {{version of the}} APY-10. Unlike the preceding P-3, the P-8 lacks a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) due to its higher operational altitude; its acoustic sensor system is reportedly more effective at acoustic tracking and thus lacking a MAD won't impede its detection capabilities; India's P-8I {{is equipped with a}} MAD per the contract request. Various sensor data are combined via <b>data</b> <b>fusion</b> software to track targets. Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin's Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the Navy's requirement. During the P-8A Increment 2 upgrade in 2016, the APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) will be replaced by the Advanced Airborne Sensor radar.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} of heterogeneous <b>data</b> source <b>fusion.</b> <b>Data</b> sources are either static or active: static data sources can be structured or semi-structured, whereas active sources are services. In order to develop <b>data</b> sources <b>fusion</b> systems in dynamic contexts, we need to study all {{issues raised by the}} matching paradigms. This challenging problem becomes crucial with the dominating role of the internet. Classical approaches of data integration, based on schemas mediation, are not suitable to the World Wide Web (WWW) environment where data is frequently modified or deleted. Therefore, we develop a loosely integrated approach that takes into consideration both conflict management and semantic rules which must be enriched in order to integrate new data sources. Moreover, we introduce an XML-based Multi-data source Fusion Language (MFL) that aims to define and retrieve conflicting data from multiple data sources. The system, which is developed according to this approach, is called MDSManager (Multi-Data Source Manager). The benefit of the proposed framework is shown through a real world application based on web <b>data</b> sources <b>fusion</b> which is dedicated to online markets indices tracking. Finally, we give an evaluation of our MFL language. The results show that our language improves significantly the XQuery language especially considering its expressiveness power and its performances...|$|R

40|$|Virgin forest {{ecosystems}} resemble the key reference level for natural tree growth dynamics. The mosaic cycle concept describes such dynamics as local disequilibria driven by patch level succession cycles of breakdown, regeneration, juvenescence and old growth. These cycles, however, may involve different traits of light demanding and shade tolerant species assemblies. In this work a <b>data</b> model <b>fusion</b> concept {{will be introduced}} to assess the differences in growth dynamics of the mosaic cycle of the Western Congolian Lowland Rainforest ecosystem. Field data from 34 forest patches located in an ice age forest refuge, recently pinpointed {{to the ground and}} still devoid of direct human impact up to today - resemble the data base. A 3 D error assessment procedure versus BGC model simulations for the 34 patches revealed two different growth dynamics, consistent with observed growth traits of pioneer and late succession species assemblies of the Western Congolian Lowland rainforest.
