40|$|Management of {{volunteer}} <b>horseradish</b> {{is a major}} challenge in fields when <b>horseradish</b> {{is included in the}} crop rotation. Three field studies were conducted: 1) to evaluate the growth habit and density {{of volunteer}} <b>horseradish,</b> 2) to evaluate the efficacy of fall herbicide applications for control of volunteer <b>horseradish,</b> 3) to evaluate the tolerance of subsequent <b>horseradish</b> crops to persisting soil residues of halosulfuron. One year following <b>horseradish</b> production, field infestations of volunteer <b>horseradish</b> ranged from 0. 08 to 6. 60 plants/m 2 with the majority of plants emerging from established roots left below the depth of <b>horseradish</b> harvest and tillage. Fall herbicide applications provided effective control of volunteer <b>horseradish</b> compared to the nontreated control. Combinations of 2, 4 –D tank–mixed with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron achieved the greatest control of volunteer <b>horseradish</b> and reduced volunteer <b>horseradish</b> densities to less than 1 plant /m 2, while glyphosate alone provided the least control and density reduction. In addition to volunteer <b>horseradish</b> control, combinations of 2, 4 –D with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron also provided 97 % or greater control of winter annual weeds (henbit, common chickweed, and Carolina foxtail).

40|$|Collinsville, Illinois is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of <b>horseradish</b> is the nation. The river bottom geography surrounding Collinsville, Illinois near St. Louis, Missouri is a high-production area for <b>horseradish.</b> The development of soybean technologies resistant to dicamba or 2, 4 -D may allow <b>horseradish</b> growers {{to gain control of}} troublesome weeds, such as Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) or volunteer <b>horseradish,</b> but could pose risks as well. Drift of these two herbicides or carryover to <b>horseradish</b> could cause severe injury and possible crop loss. While synthetic auxin-tolerant soybean may also allow growers to control volunteer <b>horseradish,</b> herbicide efficacy may differ depending on the volunteer <b>horseradish</b> variety. These risks and benefits could affect the adoption rate of these new soybean technologies in <b>horseradish</b> production areas. A field trial was established in 2015 in Edwardsville, IL and 2016 Medora, IL to simulate drift of both dicamba and 2, 4 -D onto <b>horseradish.</b> Applications were made in <b>horseradish</b> to mimic drift of a mid-post emergence application in soybean onto the <b>horseradish</b> crop. Plants were monitored for injury and stand, height, and yield reductions throughout the season. Individual roots were evaluated post-harvest. Overall, 2, 4 -D caused more injury at all rates when compared to dicamba. <b>Horseradish</b> growers may see yield reductions if rates at or greater than 1 / 1000 X of a field rate of 2, 4 -D drift onto their fields. Not planting <b>horseradish</b> near a 2, 4 -D-tolerant soybean field, as well as reading the herbicide labels and following application requirements, should help growers prevent serious injury and yield loss. On the other hand, rates of 2, 4 -D at or above a full field rate offered complete control of all plants; therefore, growers who struggle with persistent volunteer <b>horseradish</b> could rotate to a 2, 4 -D-tolerant soybean and gain needed control of those plants. Field experiments were conducted in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to investigate the impact of dicamba residues following applications in a dicamba-tolerant soybean crop on <b>horseradish</b> planted the following season. Carryover trials were conducted as two-year rotations of soybean followed by <b>horseradish</b> in Collinsville, Illinois. Multiple rates of dicamba were applied at several timings in dicamba-tolerant soybean and the crop was monitored for injury. The following season <b>horseradish</b> was planted and monitored for injury and stand, height, and yield reductions. No injury or reductions were observed with any treatment in either year, potentially indicating a lack of dicamba remaining in the soil. <b>Horseradish</b> plant stand counts, height as well as yields were not reduced when compared to the nontreated. Results from this experiment suggest that rotating from dicamba-tolerant soybean to <b>horseradish</b> should pose no threat to <b>horseradish.</b> Greenhouse experiments were carried out in 2016 in three separate runs. Each run consisted of three replications of five varieties of <b>horseradish,</b> 604, 788, 9705, Hungarian, and V 7 E 3, and two rates of dicamba, glyphosate, and dicamba plus glyphosate. Plants were sprayed when at least one plant in each pot had reached a height of 17 to 23 cm. <b>Horseradish</b> was then rated for injury at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment (DAT). Heights were also taken at 0, 14, and 28 DAT. At 28 DAT plants were harvested, weighed and place in a dryer for 72 hours and weighed again. The lowest level of injury at 28 DAT was with variety 604. The control of <b>horseradish</b> roots is critical to ensure the plant is killed completely and does not return the following season as a volunteer. The concerns associated with auxin-tolerant crops can be mitigated with proper management of herbicides and crop locations. While off target movement of 2, 4 -D may cause damage to a <b>horseradish</b> crop, it {{could be used as a}} herbicide to control volunteer <b>horseradish.</b> Additionally, if a grower chooses to use a dicamba-tolerant soybean variety, they may have the choice to use a dicamba plus glyphosate premix which will also give good control of volunteer <b>horseradish</b> with little concerns of dicamba carryover to the subsequent <b>horseradish</b> crop. Capitalizing on the strengths and weaknesses of each technology will help <b>horseradish</b> growers manage many weeds and facilitate the production of this important specialty crop...|$|R

A very weak labelling of the same neuronal pathways by acidic <b>horseradish</b> peroxidase was obtained only after increasing the amount injected by approximately two-fold.
