25|$|By late 1956, {{the decline}} of the American {{merchant}} marine, budget problems in New York City, the expense of maintaining, repairing, and operating John W. Brown, and the cost of busing students between the schools main building and the ship had created financial difficulties for the high school that it would never fully overcome. New York City officials gave thought to ending the maritime vocational training program and closing the school, but cost-cutting measures were instituted, such as returning in September 1957 to the schedule of <b>having</b> <b>students</b> study in the schools building for a week at time and aboard ship for a week at time, eliminating the expense of busing.

500|$|When the {{campaign}} ran low on adult volunteers, James Bevel, SCLC's Director of Direct Action, {{thought of the}} idea of <b>having</b> <b>students</b> become the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign. He then trained and directed high school, college, and elementary school students in nonviolence, and asked them to participate in the demonstrations by taking a peaceful walk fifty at a time from the 16th Street Baptist Church to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation. This resulted in over a thousand arrests, and, as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students, the Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene [...] "Bull" [...] Connor, used high-pressure water hoses and police attack dogs on the children and adult bystanders. Not all of the bystanders were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely nonviolent walk, but the students held to the nonviolent premise. King and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm's way.|$|E

Henry opposed the Constitution because of its grant of a strong executive, the president; he had not fought to free Virginia from King George to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot.

2500|$|During {{the time}} that Akers was alive, till 1966, money was {{allocated}} to paint and display the engine. In 1969, a group of MSU students formed the Michigan State University Railroad Club as a railfan group. Steve Reeves, a student and part-time employee of the Museum, whose responsibility was to display the engine on football weekends, sent out a notice in the State News that the Railroad Club would be meeting. [...] Those early meetings did not discuss {{the restoration of the}} engine. [...] Instead, they were slide shows of engines various members had seen on trips across the US, most of which were diesels. In 1970, at the suggestion of Randy Paquette, the club investigated the possibility of restoring the locomotive to running condition and started on that goal in 1971, with Baker's permission. Baker later stated that he thought <b>having</b> <b>students</b> be occupied with restoring a locomotive was far more in keeping with his idea of the image the university should be presenting than campus protests. [...] Dr. Breslin, the university vice president, was not so sure. [...] After the club started removing the sheet metal and exposing a rusty boiler, Breslin sent Baker to the engine with two messages. The first was the instruction to paint the engine. (The university needs to look good, even when it is being worked on). The second message was the day the students stop working on the engine is the day the torches come out. [...] The locomotive was safe as long as the students kept working on it. To emphasize, he had the hopper car next to the engine cut up the next week.|$|E
