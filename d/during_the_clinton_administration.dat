25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party.

These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
