[...] Benedictus used gelatin and other adhesives instead of Canadian balsam in the laminated glass. During World War I, laminated glass {{was used to}} make small, round lenses in gas masks and for windshields in military motor vehicles and aircraft. (For {{a number of recent}} years, the DuPont chemical company gave a Benedictus Award for the innovative use of laminated glass in architecture.)

40|$|Inhalation {{exposure}} to total and hexavalent chromium (TCr and HCr) {{was assessed by}} personal air sampling and biological monitoring in 53 welders and 20 references. Median inhalation exposure levels of TCr were 1. 3, 6. 0, and 5. 4 microg/m(3) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> of mild steel (MS, 5 % alloys), and stainless steel (SS, > 26 % alloys), respectively. The median exposures to HCr compounds were 0. 23, 0. 20, and 0. 08 microg/m(3), respectively. Median concentrations of TCr in urine, blood plasma and erythrocytes were elevated in all welders, compared with the corresponding median concentrations in the reference group (p< 0. 005). The TCr levels observed in plasma were two-fold higher in welders of SS and HAS than in welders of MS (p< 0. 01). Exposure to HCr as indicated by median total content of Cr in erythrocytes was 10 microg/L in welders of SS, MS and HAS. Uptake of TCr during the shift was confirmed <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> of SS by a median increase of urinary TCr from pre- to post-shift of 0. 30 microg/g creatinine. <b>For</b> <b>welders</b> of MS and HAS as a group TCr was not increased...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. Infantile {{strabismus}} {{in humans}} and the monkey {{is associated with}} maldevelopment of visual motion responsive-ness, one manifestation of which is directionally asymmetric motion visual evoked potentials (motion VEPs).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how early versus delayed repair of strabismus influences the development or maldevelopment of motion VEPs. METHODS. Optical strabismus was created in infant macaques by fitting them with prism goggles on day 1 of life.

40|$|The {{personal}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} exposure levels {{of a group}} of welders and nearby workers were estimated using a photosensitive polymer film, polysulphone. The polysulphone film was attached to the inner and outer surfaces of eye protection, the workers' clothing, and also placed throughout the work area. The estimated average ocular exposures (inside the helmets) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> and boiler-makers were between four and five times the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit, and the estimated exposures at the spectacles of nonwelders were around 9 times MPE. Body exposures (at the clothing surface) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> were estimated to be around 3000 times MPE and for nonwelders around 13 times MPE. The ambient ultraviolet radiation levels in the factory were found to exceed the MPE by an average of 5. 5 times, even in nonwelding areas. The results suggest that welders require additional ocular protection to supplement conventional welding helmets, and any exposed skin areas of workers in this environment should also be protected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize personal exposures to welding-related metals and gases <b>for</b> production <b>welders</b> and non-welders in a large manufacturing facility. Welding fume metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding fume metals were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding fume metal exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding fume metal exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO 2 and O 3 exposure were less variable. Welding fume metal exposures were significantly higher 474 µg/m 3 <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> than non-welders 60 µg/m 3 (p= 0. 001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding fume metal exposure concentrations <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> performing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than welders performing gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Non-welders experienced exposures similar to GTAW welders despite a curtain wall barrier separating welding and non-welding work areas...|$|R

Students of rhetorics should have in mind Perelman saying that argumentation is aim­ ing at increasing the audience's agreement with the suggested theses.

50|$|In vision therapy of {{amblyopia}} and of intermittent central suppression, {{liquid crystal}} devices {{have been used for}} purposes of enhanced occlusion therapy. In this scenario, the amblyopic patient wears electronically programmable liquid crystal glasses or <b>goggles</b> <b>for</b> continuously for several hours during regular everyday activities. Wearing the device encourages or forces the patient to use both eyes alternatingly, similar to eye patching, but rapidly alternating in time. The aim is to circumvent the patient's tendency to suppress the field of view of the weaker eye and to train the patient's capacity for binocular vision. The goggles mostly feature a much slower flicker rate than the more well-known active shutter 3D glasses.|$|R
