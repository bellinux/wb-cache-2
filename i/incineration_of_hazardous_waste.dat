40|$|Halogenated {{aromatic}} compounds (Ar-Xs) {{are widely}} used as solvents, starting materials, intermediates or active compounds {{in the production of}} specialty chemicals like dyes and pigments, remedies and pesticides. In some cases Ar-Xs are produced as undesirable by-products. However, Ar-Xs have often biocidal properties, they are typical recalcitrant compounds in environment. Nowadays, the waste streams contaminated with Ar-X are incinerated in hazardous waste incinerators, this thermal oxidation process is accompanied by formation of very toxic and very stable polychlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. PCDD/Fs have played a main part in the debate about waste incineration for many years. In many countries, including Czech Republic, public opinion is generally against <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> We proved that reductive dehalogenation enables simple, cheap and very effective destruction of Ar-X to the corresponding Ar-H using aluminum alloys at room temperature and ambient pressure. Produced Ar-H are biodegradable, produced inorganic waste is fully recyclable (Ni or Cu slurry) or applicable in another processes (aluminum hydroxide). S pomocí Al-Ni slitiny je možné efektivně hydrodehalogenovat všechny studované aromatické halogenderiváty v alkalickém vodném prostředí.

40|$|For the {{operators}} of small incineration plants for chemotoxic or radioactive hazardous waste, advanced incineration techniques {{are of interest}} {{with a view to}} improving the operating characteristics and reducing gaseous pollutant emissions. The subject {{of this study was to}} investigate oxygen enrichment in the supply air for the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The aim was to determine the benefits and disadvantages of this technology for industrial application. Pilot-scale experiments were carried out in a swivelling furnace. The waste throughput was increased by a factor of 3 during the experiments while maintaining the exhaust gas quality, which implies a cost-efficient capacity expansion. On the other hand, considerable energy savings and a diminution of the exhaust gas purification section are achieved by reducing the nitrogen content in the supply air. Moreover, short-time oxygen addition can reduce unburned hydrocarbon emissions in the event of larger packages being incinerated. The discharge of heavy metals was significantly reduced to 40 percent by oxygenation. The results of the measurements show that the frequently discussed reduction of pollutants does not occur. This applies to nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated benzenes and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). Due to a three-fold reduction in exhaust gas volume and the same pollutant concentration, a waste-mass-related reduction of the pollutant emission occurs. Therefore, incineration with oxygen enrichment is more environment-friendly than the conventional incineration process. For larger plant dimensions, however, an increase in nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions is to be assumed. A clear reduction of the emission of organic hydrocarbon compounds was achieved by increasing the residence time of the exhaust gas in the combustion chamber. It was even possible to reduce the PCDD/F emissions under the legal limit, which is 0, 1 ng/Nm" 3. (orig.)

40|$|The United States Congress {{has passed}} several laws {{during the past}} two decades which have had a {{tremendous}} impact on our air, water and land. These laws are: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. It has commonly been felt that the civil and environmental engineering professions have been the major benefactors of the new crusade for innovative technologies that were spawned from the passing of these new laws. This has not necessarily been the case; energy engineers have benefited more than any other profession. A quick review of the different laws reveals the many new areas in which it has become common for the energy engineer to become intimately involved. Several of the more celebrated examples of this involvement are resource recovery, either through mass burn technology or refuse derived fuels, direct <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes,</b> the use <b>of</b> anaerobic wastewater treatment to recover by-product methane, the need for more advanced methods of scrubbing SO 2 and NOx out of off-gasses, etc. It appears that during the past few years environmental and energy affairs have become linked together.

40|$|Combustion is a {{key element}} of many {{critical}} technologies used by contemporary society. For example, electric power production, home heating, surface and air transportation, space propulsion, and materials synthesis all utilize combustion as a source of energy. Yet, although combustion technology is vital to our standard of living, it poses great challenges to maintaining a habitable environment. For example, pollutants, atmospheric change and global warming, unwanted fires and explosions, and the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> are major problem areas which would benefit from improved understanding of combustion. Effects of gravitational forces impede combustion studies more than most other areas of science since combustion involves production of high-temperature gases whose low density results in buoyant motion, vastly complicating the execution and interpretation of experiments. Effects of buoyancy are so ubiquitous that their enormous negative impact on the rational development of combustion science is generally not recognized. Buoyant motion also triggers the onset of turbulence, yielding complicating unsteady effects. Finally, gravity forces cause particles and drops to settle, inhibiting deconvoluted studies of heterogeneous flames important to furnace, incineration and power generation technologies. Thus, effects of buoyancy have seriously limited our capabilities to carry out 'clean' experiments needed for fundamental understanding of flame phenomena. Combustion scientists can use microgravity to simplify the study of many combustion processes, allowing fresh insights into important problems via a deeper understanding of elemental phenomena also found in Earth-based combustion processes and to additionally provide valuable information concerning how fires behave in microgravity and how fire safety on spacecraft can be enhanced...|$|R

This study examined environmental hazard assessment in theory and in practice. Discussion established the unique nature of environmental hazard assessment as compared to financial or natural hazard assessment. This first section examined advantages and shortcomings of four methods to judge the tolerability of environmental hazards: Natural Baselines, Risk/Cost/Benefit Analysis, Revealed Preferences, and Expressed Preferences. The differences in perspectives between expert risk assessors and the lay public was highlighted. For the case <b>of</b> ocean <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> the dilemma faced by agencies in selecting an assessment process was shown to be partially resolved by agency reaction to interest groups. Several agencies {{were involved in the}} assessment process including: The Air Force, the Maritime Administration, three separate branches of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. Eight agency hazard assessment reports authored by these agencies were reviewed. A correlation was established between interest groups and hazard perspectives. The balance struck between expert and public hazard perspectives for each of the reports was determined. The major legal, bureaucratic, factual, and political factors influencing the balancing process was observed. The changes in the balance over time was shown to correlate with changes in the relative strength of interest groups. Two additional findings are noted.

Waste minimization, recycling, and treatment are being vigorously pursued. Although there are many different treatment methods, such as physical/chemical treatment and stabilization/solidification methods, incineration is the most universally applicable.

This paper find out the “break even” standard for dioxin and furan emission where emission control costs and societal costs are equal. This is an attempt to develop a conceptual approach to consider societal cost as one of the determinants for developing emission standard in future.

DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels. Performance data from a variety of sources was reviewed to determine ranges of achievable mercury control. Preliminary costs were estimated for using these technologies to control mercury emissions from mixed waste incineration. Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> other <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> because <b>of</b> higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for wet scrubbing and carbon adsorption is highly variable.

40|$|Aimed {{to give a}} {{preliminary}} image of dioxin pollution in China, chemometric analysis was performed to determine background dioxin levels during the period 1994 - 2002 and potential emission sources. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the congener profiles of 71 sediment samples from rivers, lakes, and sea bays around China were compared with the congener profiles of various known or suspected industrial, residential, and municipal dioxin sources {{to determine whether the}} dioxin residues typically found in a broad range of potential environmental sources could explain the presence of these chemicals in China. It was found that the background dioxin levels of China were similar to those of lightly polluted samples from other countries during the period 1994 - 2002. Primary ferrous ore sintering and secondary lead and aluminum smelters were the major sources of dioxin emission in China. Chloranil and wastewater from chemical plants, sodium pentachlorophenate, and pulp bleaching were also important sources of dioxin emission. Open burning of e-waste as well as diesel-fueled and leaded gas-fueled vehicles were additional possible sources of dioxin. In contrast to other countries, in China, flue gases from <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>waste,</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste,</b> and medical waste might be minor sources of dioxin emission.

During {{the past decade or}} so, non-thermal plasma techniques have been investigated (see the references in [1, 2]) for the remediation of waste streams with concentrations in this intermediate range (to our knowledge, our project {{was the only one that}} addressed this problem under the EMSP sponsorship). Our approach is a completely different from those previous non-thermal plasma techniques. The main objective was to investigate the feasibility of a novel plasma chemical process for the remediation of toxic gas mixtures based on an enhanced dissociative electron attachment process that had been discovered in a basic research program: Prior to this project, it had been found that molecules excited to highly-excited states via laser irradiation efficiently attached electrons leading to the dissociation of the molecule (see, [3 - 6] and references therein). The following tasks were needed to be completed during the three year duration of the project in order to illustrate the feasibility of the new technology: 1. Since the usage of lasers is not cost effective, two discharge based schemes were planned to be investigated for molecular excitation. 2. The basic mechanisms involving dissociative electron attachment to highly-excite d molecules needed to be studied, in order to optimize the process. 3. A bench-top plasma reactor needed to be constructed to conduct actual plasma destruction measurements, so that the destruction efficiency could be quantified. 4. Methodologies for, (a) determination of the destruction efficiency, and (b) analysis of the byproducts 4 from the reactor, needed to be developed. 5. Basic studies needed to be conducted to understand the observations of the remediation studies, and thus to enhance the remediation process.

Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries.Two international agreements were passed {{in response to the}} growing exportation <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991 the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import <b>of</b> all <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export <b>of</b> all <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the present <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> program <b>of</b> 3 M Company (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company). 3 M's definition <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and the company's position on <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> disposal are first considered. The company {{position is that}} wherever and whenever the disposal of a waste material threatens the environment or public safety, then that waste {{should be considered a}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and treated accordingly in terms of its handling and ultimate disposal. The generation <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> and the differentiation of "hazardous" and "nonhazardous" wastes are described next. Handling <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> from their generation to their disposal is then covered. This includes a definition of internal 3 M terminology and a description of the hazard rating system used by the company. Finally, 3 M disposal practices are presented. It is 3 M's position that thermal destruction <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes,</b> where appropriate, is the best method for their disposal. With this in mind, 3 M has constructed incineration facilities throughout the country. The rotary kiln incinerator at the 3 M Chemolite plant in Cottage Grove, Minnesota is briefly described. Disposal <b>of</b> certain <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> in controlled secure land disposal sites is then briefly discussed...|$|R
