25|$|DHT signals {{mainly in}} an intracrine and paracrine manner in the tissues {{in which it}} is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a {{circulating}} <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone.</b> Circulating levels of DHT are 1/10th and 1/20th those of testosterone in terms of total and free concentrations, respectively, whereas local DHT levels may be up to 10times those of testosterone in tissues with high 5α-reductase expression such as the prostate gland. In addition, unlike testosterone, DHT is inactivated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) into the very weak androgen 3α-androstanediol in various tissues such as muscle, adipose, and liver among others, and in relation to this, has been reported to be a very poor anabolic agent when given exogenously.|$|E
25|$|DHT {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Adolf Butenandt {{and his colleagues}} in 1935. It was prepared via hydrogenation of testosterone, which had been discovered earlier that year. DHT was introduced for medical use as an AAS in 1953, and was noted to be more potent than testosterone but with reduced androgenicity. It was not elucidated to be an endogenous substance until 1956, when it was shown to be formed from testosterone in rat liver homogenates. The biological importance of DHT was not realized until the early 1960s, when it {{was found to be}} produced by 5α-reductase from circulating testosterone in target tissues like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles and was found to be more potent than testosterone in bioassays. The biological functions of DHT in humans became much more clearly defined upon the discovery and characterization of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in 1974. DHT was the last major sex hormone, the others being testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, to be discovered, and is unique in that it is the only major sex hormone that functions principally as an intracrine and paracrine hormone rather than as an <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone.</b>|$|E

25|$|Dioxins (most {{notably the}} polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) are {{chemicals}} that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This occurs when chlorinated products {{are used in}} certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat {{for long periods of}} time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone</b> disruptors. Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity is increasing which becomes worrisome due to its association with several diseases and certain types of cancers. While weight control through dietary caloric restriction and/or physical activity protects against cancer in animal models, the underlying mechanisms are not fully defined. Weight loss due to negative energy balance is associated with alterations of multiple growth factors and <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones.</b> The altered hormones and hormone-related functions appear {{to be responsible for}} anti-cancer mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the recent studies related to weight loss and the altered <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones,</b> focusing on the reduced levels of the mitogenic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) and adipokine leptin as well as the raised levels of adiponectin and glucocorticoids. The potential molecular targets of these hormone-dependent signalling pathways are also discussed.

In order to understand the role of leptin sensitivity on other <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones</b> concentrations, we examined body mass, serum leptin level, serum insulin, tri-iodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in Tupaia belangeri under seasonal acclimatized (The simulated temperature and photoperiod in winter: 5 °C and SD, 8 h: 16 h Light:Dark; the simulated temperature and photoperiod in summer: 30 °C and SD, 16 h: 8 h Light:Dark) for 4 weeks. The results showed that body mass, serum leptin level, serum T 3, T 4 concentrations and T 3 / T 4 showed significant variation, but serum insulin and TSH concentrations showed no variations between treatment group. There were positive correlation between serum leptin level and insulin, T 4 concentrations, and were negative correlation between serum leptin level and body mass, T 3 concentrations. However, no correlation was found between serum TSH concentrations and serum leptin level.

50|$|Somogyi {{and others}} have claimed that if {{prolonged}} hypoglycemia is untreated, then stress due to low blood sugar {{can result in a}} high blood glucose rebound. The physiological mechanisms driving the rebound are defensive. When the blood glucose level falls below normal, the body responds by releasing the <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone</b> glucagon as well as the stress hormones epinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone. Glucagon facilitates release of glucose from the liver that raises the blood glucose immediately, and the stress hormones cause insulin resistance for several hours, sustaining the elevated blood sugar.|$|E
5000|$|Cholecystokinin (CCK) is {{a unique}} peptide {{released}} by the duodenal [...] "I cells" [...] in response to chyme containing high fat or protein content. Unlike secretin, which is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone,</b> CCK actually works via stimulation of a neuronal circuit, the end-result of which is stimulation of the acinar cells to release their content. CCK also increases gallbladder contraction, resulting in bile squeezed into the cystic duct, common bile duct and eventually the duodenum. Bile of course helps absorption of the fat by emulsifying it, increasing its absorptive surface. Bile is made by the liver, but is stored in the gallbladder.|$|E
5000|$|IGF-1 is {{produced}} {{primarily by the}} liver as an <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormone</b> {{as well as in}} target tissues in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. Production is stimulated by growth hormone (GH) and can be retarded by undernutrition, growth hormone insensitivity, lack of growth hormone receptors, or failures of the downstream signaling pathway post GH receptor including SHP2 and STAT5B. Approximately 98% of IGF-1 is always bound to one of 6 binding proteins (IGF-BP). IGFBP-3, the most abundant protein, accounts for 80% of all IGF binding. IGF-1 binds to IGFBP-3 in a 1:1 molar ratio. IGFBP-1 is regulated by insulin.|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of reproductive processes involves a complex network of communication systems between the brain, endocrine organs, the gonads and other reproductive tissues.

In this review, the structure and physiology of the inhibins, activins and follistatin are discussed in terms of the evidence supporting their role as <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones,</b> and how they might function as paracrine factors within the pituitary, gonad and associated tissues.

Like the average neuron, these cells conduct electrical impulses along the axon but unlike theses neurons, neurosecretion produces neurohormones that are released into the body’s circulation. Combining the properties of the nervous and endocrine, these cells have the capacity to affect nerves through chemical messengers. Neurosecretion is a broad area of study and must be further observed to be better understood.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{observation}} of brown adipose tissue (BAT) being functional in adult humans provides {{a rationale for}} its stimulation to increase energy expenditure through ‘adaptive thermogenesis’ for an anti-obesity strategy. Many endocrine dysfunctions are associated with changes in metabolic rate that over time may result in changes in body weight. It is likely that human BAT {{plays a role in}} such processes. Review: In this brief review article, we explore the endocrine determinants of BAT activity, and discuss how these insights may provide a basis for future developments of novel therapeutic strategies for obesity management. A review of electronic and print data comprising original and review articles retrieved from PubMed search up to December 2013 was conducted (Search terms: brown adipose tissue, brown fat, obesity, hormone). In addition, relevant references from the articles were screened for papers containing original data. Conclusion: There is promising data to suggest that targeting <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones</b> for BAT modulation can yield a cellular bioenergetics answer for successful prevention and management of human obesity. Further understanding of the physiological link between various <b>endocrine</b> <b>hormones</b> and BAT is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options...|$|R
