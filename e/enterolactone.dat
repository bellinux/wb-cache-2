Activation of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) receptor (IGF- 1 R) signaling is critical for prostate cancer cell growth and progression. This study examined whether the growth inhibitory effect of <b>enterolactone</b> was related to changes in the IGF- 1 /IGF- 1 R system in PC- 3 prostate cancer cells. At nutritionally relevant concentrations (20 – 60 μmol/L), <b>enterolactone</b> inhibited IGF- 1 –induced activation of IGF- 1 R and its downstream AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase signaling pathways. Inhibition of AKT by <b>enterolactone</b> resulted in decreased phosphorylation of its downstream targets, including p 70 S 6 K 1 and glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β. <b>Enterolactone</b> also inhibited cyclin D 1 expression. As a result, <b>enterolactone</b> inhibited proliferation and migration of PC- 3 cells. Knockdown of IGF- 1 R by plasmids with siRNA (si) against IGF- 1 R mRNA resulted in inhibition of proliferation of PC- 3 cells and cell numbers did not differ when the si-IGF- 1 R groups (cells transfected with plasmids containing siRNA against IGF- 1 R mRNA) were treated or untreated with <b>enterolactone.</b> These results suggest that <b>enterolactone</b> suppresses proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells, at least partially, through inhibition of IGF- 1 /IGF- 1 R signaling.

40|$|Diets high in fibre have {{previously}} {{been associated with}} decreased {{risk of breast cancer}} in the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort. Several potent compounds may exist in high-fibre diets that might protect against breast cancer, for example lignans. Plant lignans are converted to <b>enterolactone</b> by the gut microflora and are similar in structure to estrogens. <b>Enterolactone</b> may interact with the estrogen receptors (ERs) and, therefore, inhibit the effect of estrogens. The aim of this doctoral project was to prospectively examine if plant food intakes and <b>enterolactone</b> blood concentrations were associated with breast cancer, and to examine if the association differed depending on ER status of the tumours or variation in the ER genes. Information (including high validity dietary data) from the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort with baseline examinations from 1991 to 1996 was used. Among 15, 773 women, 45 - 73 years at baseline, without prevalent cancer, 544 women were diagnosed with breast cancer until 31 December 2004. High intakes of high-fibre bread were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. When restricting the analyses to individuals with suggested more stable food habits, a decreased breast cancer risk were also observed with high intakes of fruit, berries and vegetables. High-fibre bread and fruit and berries were the main dietary determinants of <b>enterolactone</b> concentration. In addition, obesity and smoking was associated with lower <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations. High <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations (> 16 nmol/L) was associated with decreased breast cancer risk. When stratifying for fibre intake, a decreased breast cancer risk with high <b>enterolactone</b> concentration was only observed among individuals with high fibre intakes. Relatively high variation of <b>enterolactone</b> within and between individuals was observed; the association between <b>enterolactone</b> and risk of breast cancer is likely attenuated. The reduced breast cancer risk with high <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations was only observed for ERα-positive and ERβ-negative tumours. Breast cancer risk was not significantly associated with any of the selected polymorphisms in the ERα and ERβ genes. However, the protective effect of high <b>enterolactone</b> concentration was seen in subgroups of the individuals with specific genetic variants, and a tendency towards an interaction between a polymorphism in intron 3 of the ERα gene and <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations was observed. In conclusion, a high-fibre diet including high-fibre bread, fruit, berries and vegetables will likely reduce {{the risk of breast cancer}} in middle aged and older women.

Objective: We examined the cross-sectional associations between the serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentration and variables related to diet and health in Finnish adults. Design: Serum <b>enterolactone</b> was measured by using time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay in 2380 Finnish men and women aged 25 – 64 y who were participating in a cross-sectional national survey in 1997. Background information was collected with self-administered questionnaires and the diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire. Results: The median serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentration was 13. 8 nmol/L (range: 0 – 95. 6 nmol/L) in men and 16. 6 nmol/L (range: 0 – 182. 6 nmol/L) in women. Multiple regression analyses showed positive associations in men between the serum entero-lactone concentration and constipation, consumption of whole-grain products, and intake of fruit and berries. In women, the serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentration was positively and indepen-dently associated with consumption of vegetables, subject age, and constipation and was negatively associated with smoking. Furthermore, female subjects of normal weight had significantly higher serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations than did their under-weight or obese peers.

40|$|Our {{previous}} study demonstrated that lignan metabolites <b>enterolactone</b> and enterodiol inhibited colonic cancer cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

This study tested the hypothesis that dietary SDG might have a different effect than its metabolites in human colonic SW 480 cancer cells. Treatment with SDG at 0 to 40 μmol/L for up to 48 hours resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell numbers, which was comparable to <b>enterolactone.</b> The inhibition of cell growth by SDG {{did not appear to}} be mediated by cytotoxicity, but by a cytostatic mechanism associated with an increase of cyclin A expression. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that SDG in the media was much more stable than <b>enterolactone</b> (95 % of SDG survival vs 57 % of <b>enterolactone</b> after 48 -hour treatment). When the cells were treated with either <b>enterolactone</b> or SDG at 40 μmol/L for 48 hours, the intracellular levels of <b>enterolactone,</b> as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/electron spray ionization, were about 8. 3 × 10 − 8 nmol per cell; but intracellular SDG or potential metabolites were undetectable. Taken together, SDG demonstrated similar effects on cell growth, cytotoxicity, and cell cycle arrest when compared with its metabolite <b>enterolactone.</b> However, the reliable stability and undetectable intracellular SDG in treated cells may suggest that metabolism of SDG, if exposed directly to the colonic cells, could be different from the known degradation by microorganisms in human gut...|$|E

Phytoestrogen concentrations were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay after hydrolysis and extraction in samples from 85 middle-aged subjects who were part of a 12 -week dietary intervention study carried out in North Karelia, Finland. In the baseline and the switchback periods, the subjects consumed their habitual Finnish diet, which is high in saturated fat and low in polyunsaturated fat and vegetables.

The aim was to investigate the association between prediagnostic <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations and mortality among men with prostate cancer. SSUBLJECTS/METHODS: Prediagnostic plasma concentrations of <b>enterolactone</b> from 1390 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort were related to all-cause or prostate cancer-specific death, using Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up time (from the date of diagnose until the date of death, emigration or end of follow-up by December 2013) as the underlying time axis. RESULTS: The hazard ratios for <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations assessed linearly by 20 nmol/l increments was 0. 95 (0. 90, 1. 02) for all-cause mortality and 0. 98 (0. 92, 1. 05) for prostate cancer-specific mortality.

We assessed the association between serum <b>enterolactone</b> and postmenopausal breast cancer risk using conditional logistic regression accounting for potential risk and confounding factors.

Additionally, a meta-analysis with seven further studies addressing <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations and breast cancer risk was performed.

30|$|<b>Enterolactone</b> is a biphenol, {{which can}} {{function}} as anti-oxidant. A {{study shows that}} high serum <b>enterolactone</b> level is associated with reduced CVD mortality (Vanharanta et al., 2003). Furthermore, low serum <b>enterolactone</b> is associated with increased in vivo lipid peroxidation, assessed by plasma F 2 -isoprostane concentrations (Vanharanta et al., 2002). In addition, urinary total and individual phytoestrogens were significantly inversely associated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP; an inflammation biomarker) (Reger et al., 2017). Phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen receptors (Morito et al., 2001), which either mimics estrogen or works as antagonist (Fitzpatrick, 1999). Thus, the effects of phytoestrogens can be biphasic: for example, phytoestrogens both increases vasodilation and nitric oxide metabolism that may have a favorable impact on vascular health; on the other hand, phytoestrogen may also have some prothrombotic or proinflammatory effects that may offset other benefits (Herrington, 2000). Both <b>enterolactone</b> and enterodiol can alleviate the effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide (Corsini et al., 2010). Such lymphocytes activation leads to inhibitory-κB (I-κB) degradation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation thereby resulting in TNF-α production (Corsini et al., 2010).

During follow-up (1987 - 1998) of 15, 107 subjects, aged 20 - 59 years, 236 incident nonfatal myocardial infarction cases were diagnosed. Controls (n = 283) were frequency matched to the cases on age, sex, and study center. No statistically significant associations between plasma enterodiol and <b>enterolactone</b> and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction were detected. The odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quartile of enterodiol was 1. 21 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 70, 2. 12; p for trend = 0. 74), and that of <b>enterolactone</b> 1. 51 (95 % CI: 0. 87, 2. 61; p for trend = 0. 12) after adjustment for known dietary risk factors for coronary heart disease.

The authors investigated {{the association between}} plasma <b>enterolactone</b> and enterodiol and co-lorectal cancer risk in a Dutch prospective study. Among more than 35, 000 participants aged 20 – 59 years, 160 colorectal cancer cases were diagnosed after 7. 5 years of follow-up (1987 – 2003). Cohort members who were frequency-matched to the cases on age, sex, and study center were selected as controls (n 387). Plasma enterodiol and <b>enterolactone</b> were not associated with risk of colorectal cancer after adjustment for known co-lorectal cancer risk factors (highest quartile vs. lowest: for enterodiol, odds ratio 1. 11, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 56, 2. 20 (p-trend 0. 75); for <b>enterolactone,</b> odds ratio 1. 70, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 88, 3. 27 (p-trend 0. 15)). However, sex (p-interaction 0. 06) and body mass index (p-interaction < 0. 01) modified the relation be-tween plasma <b>enterolactone</b> and colorectal cancer risk; increased risks were observed among women and sub-jects with a high body mass index. The association between plasma enterodiol and colorectal cancer risk was modified by smoking status; risk was increased among current smokers (p-interaction < 0. 01).

The present study examined the association between serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentration {{and the risk of}} coronary heart disease. A prospective case-cohort study was conducted among male smokers randomized to receive a placebo supplement in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (1986 – 1999). Serum <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations were measured by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometrymethod in serumcollected at trial baseline from 340 men diagnosedwith nonfatal myocardial infarction (n 205) or coronary death (n 135) during follow-up and from the randomly selected subcohort of 420 subjects.

40|$|<b>Enterolactone</b> and {{enterodiol}} are phytoestrogens with structural {{similarity to}} endogenous estrogens. Because of their biological activities, they {{may affect the}} development of several diseases. To quantify enterodiol and <b>enterolactone</b> in plasma, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with electrospray ionization using 13 C 3 labeled isotopes. The method consists of a simple enzymatic hydrolysis and ether extraction followed by a rapid LC separation (run-time of 11 min). Detection limits as low as 0. 15 nM for enterodiol and 0. 55 nM for <b>enterolactone</b> were achieved. The within-run R. S. D. ranges from 3 to 6 % and the between-run R. S.

40|$|Lignans are biphenolic {{compounds}} {{that occur in}} foods of plant origin such as whole grains, seeds, fruits and vegetables, and beverages, such as coffee and tea. Plant lignans are converted by intestinal bacteria into the enterolignans, enterodiol and <b>enterolactone.</b> Enterolignans possess several biological activities, whereby they may influence carcinogenesis. We studied the associations between plasma enterolignans {{and the risk of}} colorectal adenomas in a Dutch case-control study. Colorectal adenomas are considered to be precursors of colorectal cancer. Cases (n = 532) with at least one histologically confirmed colorectal adenoma and controls (n = 503) with no history of any type of adenoma were included. Plasma enterodiol and <b>enterolactone</b> concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Associations were stronger for incident than for prevalent cases. When only incident cases (n = 262) were included, high compared to low plasma concentrations of enterodiol were associated with a reduction in colorectal adenoma risk after adjustment for confounding variables. Enterodiol odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) were 1. 00, 0. 69 (0. 42 - 1. 13), 0. 60 (0. 37 - 0. 99), and 0. 53 (0. 32 - 0. 88) with a significant trend (P = 0. 01) through the quartiles. Although <b>enterolactone</b> plasma concentrations were 10 -fold higher, enterolactone's reduction in risk was not statistically significant (P for trend = 0. 09). Use of oral antibiotic therapy could decrease the plasma concentrations of <b>enterolactone.</b> Exclusion of antibiotic users resulted in similar odds ratios for both enterolignans, but the association for <b>enterolactone</b> became somewhat stronger (P = 0. 05 versus P = 0. 09). We observed a substantial reduction in colorectal adenoma risk among subjects with high plasma concentrations of enterolignans, in particular, enterodiol.

40|$|Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, {{are similar}} in {{structure}} to endogenous sex steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent cancer risk. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of dietary intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7 -week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52 – 82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, <b>enterolactone,</b> and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0 -gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1, 009 and 2, 867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of <b>enterolactone</b> by 21, 242 and 52, 826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (enterodiol 1 <b>enterolactone</b> 1 matairesinol) by 24, 333 and 60, 640 nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol and <b>enterolactone,</b> but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this group of postmenopausal women.

The SPE recoveries for the online SPE method are excellent for most analytes (83 – 94 %) and somewhat lower for <b>enterolactone</b> (61 %). The recoveries for all analytes with the off-line SPE method {{are also very}} good (65 – 80 %). The limit of detection is lower for the online method (0. 1 – 0. 7 ng/mL) than for the off-line method (0. 4 – 3. 3 ng/mL).
