40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} detectors {{based on}} the balanced coil system are widely used in the food industry. In the balanced <b>coil</b> system, an <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and two identical pickup coils are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup <b>coils</b> to the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and the pickup coil are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no metallic contaminant. Such strong magnetic coupling makes balancing procedure tedious. In this paper, we introduce a new coil system in which pickup coils are set orthogonal to the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil,</b> making the magnetic coupling much small compared to conventional counterpart. Pickup coils are equipped with thin magnetic cores and placed inside the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> being parallel to the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> plane.

The probe uses an <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> to induce eddy currents in conducting material perpendicularly oriented to the coil s longitudinal axis. A giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor, {{surrounded by the}} <b>excitation</b> <b>coil,</b> is used to detect generated fields. Between the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and GMR sensor is a highly permeable flux focusing lens which magnetically separates the GMR sensor and <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and produces high flux density at {{the outer edge of}} the GMR sensor. The use of feedback inside the flux focusing lens enables complete cancellation of the leakage fields at the GMR sensor location and biasing of the GMR sensor to a location of high magnetic field sensitivity. In an alternate embodiment, a permanent magnet is positioned adjacent to the GMR sensor to accomplish the biasing. Experimental results have demonstrated identification of flaws up to 1 cm deep in aluminum alloy structures.
