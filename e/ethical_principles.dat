5|$|In Stage six (universal <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> driven), moral {{reasoning}} {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b> Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E

40|$|Although the Epicurean ethical {{system is}} {{fundamentally}} egoistic and hedonistic, it attributes a surprisingly significant role to friendship. Even so, I argue that traditional discussions of Epicurean friendship fail to adequately {{account for the}} value (or pleasure) of individual friends. In this thesis I present an amended notion of Epicurean friendship that better accounts {{for all of the}} pleasure friends afford. However, the success of my project requires rejecting an Epicurean <b>ethical</b> <b>principle.</b> Because of this, I explore textual evidence both in favor and against the amended notion I propose and the problematic <b>ethical</b> <b>principle.</b> After arguing against the problematic <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> and dispelling additional objections to my project, I conclude that Epicureans should endorse the amended notion of friendship I have developed...|$|R

40|$|Predation {{causes a}} lot of {{suffering}} in the wild. Yet, {{a lot of}} people believe it is morally permissible. This article presents an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that justifies (condones) predation without referring to anthropocentric notions such as moral agency or species membership. The moral intuition that predation is permissible is coherent with other intuitions about harmful behaviors in the wild, such as the permissibility of some kinds of procreation (for example r-selection) that do not sufficiently contribute to wellbeing. These intuitions can be unified in an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that uses the three conditions of naturalness, normality and necessity. Furthermore, this 3 -N-principle is related to the intrinsic value of biodiversity. Finally, some analogies between well-being of a sentient being and biodiversity of an ecosystem are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background and Overview. Dentists {{frequently}} {{are faced with}} patients’ requests for an extraction, sometimes of the entire dentition. In this article, the authors offer guidelines to help dentists and oral surgeons make decisions regarding such requests for extraction. Conclusions. In most cases of patients’ requesting extractions, the <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> of nonmaleficence will play a decisive role in the dentist’s decision making. In {{cases in which the}} request appears influenced by a specific mental condition such as a phobia of dental treatment, extraction rarely is justifiable. Practice Implications. Dental professionals should keep in mind that they cannot be forced to carry out treatment that is at odds with the <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> of nonmaleficence or that is outside of the bounds of accepted treatment.

25|$|In the United States, art {{therapists}} {{may become}} Registered (ATR) or Board Certified (ATR-BC) (Source: http://www.atcb.org/Public/AboutTheCredentials).

Becoming a registered art therapist (ATR) with the ATCB requires that one complete a graduate-level program in art therapy from an accredited university, as well as practicum and internships, and additional clinical experience post-graduation with supervision from a professional clinician (Source: www.atcb.org/home/code). To become board-certified (ATR-BC) with the ATCB, a registered art therapist must pass a statistically vetted, nationally recognized examination, the Art Therapy Credentials Board Examination (ATCBE) (Source: www.atcb.org).|$|E
25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E
25|$|By the 15th century, its {{authority}} in the Spanish Jewish community was such that Joseph ibn Shem-Tov drew from it arguments in his attacks against Maimonides, and even representatives of non-mystical Jewish thought began to assert its sacredness and invoke {{its authority}} in the decision of some ritual questions. In Jacobs' and Broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its <b>ethical</b> <b>principles,</b> which they saw as more {{in keeping with the}} spirit of Talmudic Judaism than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of Maimonides and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect. The Zohar instead declared Man to be the lord of the creation, whose immortality is solely dependent upon his morality.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reflects}} on solidarity {{in the practice}} of family medicine in two realities. The objective is to search for solidarity as an <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> in the relationship between family doctor and subject. It is a descriptive exploratory research carried out in Florianópolis, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and in the Province of Rome, Lazio Region, Italy. It included fourteen Brazilian family doctors and fifteen Italian family doctors. The theoretical framework consisted of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of Symbolic Power. The results show the importance {{of the role of the}} family doctor in the materialization of this <b>ethical</b> <b>principle,</b> as a spokesman for scientific knowledge and as an agent of a State policy. Solidarity was understood within distinct domains and the discursive productions also demonstrated the negation of solidarity in such practice. Globalization proved to be a contemporary challenge for an ethical practice of family medicine that is marked by solidarity...|$|R

25|$|The Brahmanical {{hold over}} society, assiduously built through the later Vedic period, was coming under {{increasing}} attack. The privileges of the priests, the rigidity of the caste {{system and the}} elaborate rituals were being questioned. The lower orders among the four sects began to favour new sects. The vaishyas, who were technically included in the higher social category, were treated as inferior to both Brahmans and Kshatriya. The opposition of the commercial class to Brahmanism was to give a fillip to the other sects of the society. Buddhism began as schismatic movement from the more orthodox outlook of Brahmanism. Its basic tenet was an emphasis on misery and advocacy of the middle path. It was a set of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b> Buddhism opposed {{the dominance of the}} Brahmans and the concept of sacrifices and rituals. It thus appealed to lower social orders and to emerging social classes. The human approach to relations in society preached by Buddhism further attracted different sections to itself.|$|E
25|$|According to Romila Thapar, Ashoka's Dhamma is {{a superb}} {{document}} of his essential humanity and {{an answer to}} the socio-political needs of the contemporaneous situation. It was not anti-Brahmanical because respect for the Brahmans and Sarmanas {{is an integral part of}} his Dhamma. His emphasis on non-violence did not blind him to the needs of the state. He warned the forest tribes that although he hates to use coercion, he may be required to resort to force if they continued to create trouble. By the time Ashoka stopped war, the entire Indian sub-continent was under his control. In the south he was on friendly terms with the Cholas and Pandyas. Sri Lanka was an admiring ally. Thus, Ashoka's decline of war came when his empire had reached its natural boundaries. The plea for tolerance was a wise course of action in an ethnically diverse, religiously varied, and class divided society. Ashoka's empire was a conglomerate of diverse groups; farmers, pastoral nomads and hunter-gatherers, there were Greeks, Kambojas, and Bhojas and hundreds of groups with different traditions. In this situation a plea for tolerance was needed. Ashoka tried to transcend the parochial cultural traditions with a board set of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b>|$|E
