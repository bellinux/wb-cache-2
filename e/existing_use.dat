5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the <b>existing</b> <b>use</b> can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|The Mail coach service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the <b>existing</b> <b>use</b> of fast coaches. The horses {{required}} for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.|$|E

Qualitative data of the <b>existing</b> land <b>use</b> are especially required in the processes of spatial planning and monitoring the situation of the area. Potential database of <b>existing</b> urban land <b>use</b> would ensure adequate spatial data also for other processes; mass real estate valuation is one of them. Eventually it would become a part of a comprehensive database of <b>existing</b> land <b>use,</b> for which interministerial coordinations are absolutely necessary...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{wind energy}} (OWE) in the North Sea has the {{potential}} to meet large share of Europe’s future electricity demand. To deploy offshore wind parks in a rational way, the overall OWE potential has to be realistically determined. This has to be done on an international, cross-border level and by taking into account the existing man-made and nature-related uses of the North Sea. As spatial conflicts will arise between <b>existing</b> <b>uses</b> and the new OWE uses, a Decision Support System (DSS) based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed. Based on data of <b>existing</b> sea <b>uses</b> and calculation rules for spatial prioritisation analysis, the DSS helps in identifying areas that are (1) generally suitable for offshore wind power, (2) strictly excluded or (3) negotiable with respect to other <b>existing</b> sea <b>uses.</b> The combination of this conflict analysis together with cost assumptions for offshore wind farms and their expected electricity yield leads to identification of favourable areas for OWE deployment in the North Sea. This approach helps to reduce the conflict between offshore wind deployment and <b>existing</b> sea <b>uses</b> in the North Sea for future planning. The results can assist decision makers in developing transnational roadmaps for OWE...|$|R
