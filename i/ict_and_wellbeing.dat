The ability of nations to sustain public services – for example, to pay salaries to researchers and educators – depends upon the jobs and tax income created by their globally growing enterprises. And yet there is no university domain dedicated to producing masters and mastery of this important art. The 11 th EBRF Conference – Global Business Creation Games: Co-Creation of Enterprise for Problems Worth Solving – urged us all to make better use of our slack resources, both tangible and intangible. This is equally acutely needed in every sector of society and from every person, both natural and legal. Like in the times of the Great Explorers, bold exploration across murky waters is again called for. Like always, some roads will be dead-ends, but we cannot find the right ones without leaving our sofa. At EBRF 2011, we discussed with concern “time to market” for new products and businesses, but were equally concerned about time to market for the research we conduct – or whether our research has an impact on the marketplace, to begin with. This is how EBRF has challenged us, from the get-go, in 2001. With elements of an unconference, EBRF 2011 sought for ecosystem level impact by engaging entrepreneurs, executives, and policy makers in the scholarly process through what were called ecosystem level Live Case exercises. Such exercises were undertaken under six grand topics: Capital, Education, Energy, Health, <b>ICT,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wellbeing.</b> All the approved abstracts and conference presentations were divided between them. The purpose was to jointly discover exciting new ways forward. At least some baby steps were taken. Entrepreneurs can freely choose which type companies they build. They can, for example, concentrate on building businesses aimed at solving big social and ecological problems. Researchers can choose the problems and solutions they investigate, and the purposes they serve. Policy makers and innovation financiers can first define quite exactly what they want and demand plans that fit the bill. Alternatively, they can build agile policies that are fitted to back the most innovative, motivated and committed teams. For a game-change, co-creation across all borders is needed. At EBRF 2011, each of the ecosystem level Live Case exercises produced their own global {{business creation}} canvas. One objective was to inspire the presenters of approved abstracts when finalizing their full papers, after the conference. By an ultimate deadline, altogether 20 conference presentations transformed into full research papers, all featured on the following pages. A range of 2 - 4 full papers emerged under each grand topic. While there are only 2 papers under ICT, there are 3 papers under Capital an Energy and 4 papers under Education, Health, and Wellbeing. To be sure, as these are not business as usual research topics or streams, there may be a paper or two, for example, under Education, with little or nothing to do with education, per se. For important acknowledgement of our work and approach, Technology Innovation Management Review (www. timreview. ca) decided to dedicate a special issue to EBRF 2011 conference papers. Dedicated to “Global Business Creation”, the TIM Review June issue features seven particularly insightful EBRF papers. All but one of the grand topics, namely ICT, is represented in the special issue. Also the authors whose paper did not make the special issue pulled themselves and the fellow members of their ecosystem level Live Case exercises out of their comfort zones, thereby successfully providing value-adding inspiration, provocation and stimulation across many borders. On behalf of all the organizers, I wish to thank each contributing author and participant. In her message to the EBRF 2011 organizers, having to decline a keynote invitation, Kelly Fitzsimmons, an extraordinary lady game changer and serial entrepreneur, pointed how successful business creators come in every size, shape, gender, and colour of skin, and from every kind of family and educational background as well as type of personality. What they share in common, according to her discoveries and observations, is their willingness and ability to tolerate discomfort for unreasonably long periods of time. At EBRF 2011, we were pushed outside our comfort zone only for a few days. Even there, it was educating enough for the organizers to take a time-out on EBRF’s future. Since 2001, the conference has continuously pushed – and stretched – the envelope in the frontier between art and science, theory and practice, having perhaps reached the limit. Consequently, the conference mission and concept are currently being reconsidered, and the conference board reorganized. For closing, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the participants, co-organizers and sponsors of EBRF 2011 for an invaluable contribution. As co-founder and co-organizer or chairman of the conference since 2001, I wish to warmly thank all the individuals and institutions whose co-creative efforts and support have made 11 consecutive annual international peer reviewed business research conferences possible in Finland. For me, personally, this has been a most educational, rewarding, and worthwhile journey. Wishing all explorers both courage and passion, as well as every health, happiness, and best of luck, when enabling co-creation of great global enterprises, On behalf of the co-organizers of EBRF 2011, MARKO SEPPÄ Chairman of EBRF Boar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This report uses {{data from}} {{national}} {{health and social}} surveys of the Indigenous population, conducted between 2002 and 2012 - 13, to examine whether associations of some key social determinants with selected health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes changed over that time. Consistently during the decade, employment status and housing tenure {{were significantly associated with}} a range of health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes for the Indigenous population. As education levels have increased among the Indigenous population, the association of education with health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> has weakened. This suggests {{that at least some of}} the association of education with health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> is attributable to other characteristics of individuals or educational institutions not captured in our models, not just the outcome of the education process itself. Improvements in some health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes in remote areas, despite declining employment over the decade, suggest that more detailed analysis is required to shed light on whether associations between the selected social determinants of health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> differ for Indigenous people living in remote and nonremote areas...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} from policy-makers, practitioners, and academics alike in creating {{indicators of the}} built environment to measure progress towards achieving {{a wide range of}} policy outcomes, including enhanced health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> Public open space (POS) is a built environment feature that is important for health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> across the life course, and contributes to the liveability of a region. To optimise health <b>and</b> community <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes, {{there is a need to}} test different policy standards and metrics to understand which measures are impactful. Identifying the best POS indicators would be useful tools to measure and monitor progress towards achieving a range of policy <b>and</b> health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes. Thus, we propose a method to develop POS indicators from a health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> lens through: 1) developing a framework conceptualising the pathways in which POS influences health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> outcomes; <b>and</b> 2) using this conceptual framework as a guide to identify upstream policy-relevant indicators of POS that are evidence-based, specific, quantifiable, and measurable across regions. We also highlight methodological issues and challenges in developing these indicators. In doing so, we have identified eleven potential POS spatial measures to test with population health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> datasets in Australia. However, these methods may be relevant and applicable to other developed countries, and could be modified for use in developing countries. Together, spatial indicators are analytic tools in the policy environment to benchmark and measure neighbourhoods in terms of POS provision, thereby helping to improve neighbourhood liveability <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing,</b> <b>and</b> people&# 039;s health...|$|R

Methods: Participants were older-aged (M = 69. 59 years; SD = 8. 08 years) deceased females (N = 1, 862) from the dynamic analyses to optimise ageing (DYNOPTA) project. Growth mixture models analysed participants' responses on measures of mental health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> for up to 16 years from death. Results: Multi-level models confirmed overall terminal decline and terminal drop in both mental health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing.</b> However, modelling data from the same participants within a latent class growth mixture framework indicated that most participants reported stability in mental health (90. 3 %) <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> (89. 0 %) in the years preceding death. Conclusions: Whilst confirming other population-level analyses which support terminal decline and drop hypotheses in both mental health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing,</b> we subsequently identified that most of this effect is driven by a small, but significant minority of the population.

The following four themes are presented in the study: psychological health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> <b>and</b> how unemployment is experienced, social factors, economic factors and, how they value a job. The result of the study show that unemployment influences psychological health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing,</b> to a high extent. All of the interviewed subjects think that social support is important and that it has a positive effect during unemployment. All of them mean that their economical situation becomes worse as a reason of unemployment, and this has a negative influence on their psychological health <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing,</b> <b>and</b> especially of life quality.
