50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big <b>end-bearing</b> journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E

The test results of the proposed model in different types of sands and different relative densities show good effects compared to conventional straight piles.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was to predict piles ’ bearing {{capacities}} and <b>end-bearing</b> ratios. Finite-Element-Method was derived to establish the simulation models. The studying processes were firstly to set some unified pile top settlements and then to vary pile diameters to obtain the results, thus the performance of pile could be observed. It was found that closing to ultimate state, loads under the unified settlements were approximately linear to pile diameters, and equivalent unit side-friction forces were nearly constant, and the <b>end-bearing</b> ratios were piecewise linear to pile diameters. Based on these findings, predictive formulas were established. Following the formulas, while piles ’ bearing capacities of two certain diameters and one <b>end-bearing</b> ratio of them were known, the bearing capacities, side-friction forces and end resistances of other concerned diameters could be predicted...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} stress {{characteristics}} has been employed {{to compute the}} <b>end-bearing</b> capacity of driven piles. The dependency of the soil internal friction angle on the stress level has been incorporated to achieve more realistic predictions for the <b>end-bearing</b> capacity of piles. The validity of the assumption of the superposition principle while using the bearing capacity equation based on soil plasticity concepts, when applied to deep foundations, has been examined. Fourteen pile case histories were compiled with cone penetration tests (CPT) performed {{in the vicinity of}} different pile locations. The <b>end-bearing</b> capacity of the piles was computed using different methods, namely, static analysis, effective stress approach, direct CPT, and the proposed approach. The comparison between predictions made by different methods and measured records shows that the stress-level-based method of stress characteristics compares better with experimental data. Finally, the <b>end-bearing</b> capacity of driven piles in sand was expressed in terms of a general expression {{with the addition of a}} new factor that accounts for different factors contributing to the bearing capacity.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{located within}} consolidating ground are commonly subjected to negative skin friction (NSF) and failures of pile foundations related to dragload (compressive force) and downdrag (pile settlement) {{have been reported}} in literature. In addition, they are normally subjected to axial load and NSF simultaneously. A field study was carried out to investigate load transfer behavior of piles in <b>end-bearing</b> and floating 2 -pile groups in consolidating ground. Moreover, load transfer mechanisms of piles subjected to NSF was investigated in detail by centrifuge tests and axis-symmetric and three-dimensional numerical analyses to achieve three objectives: to investigate response of a single pile subjected to NSF with different pile tip locations with respect to <b>end-bearing</b> stratum, to study behavior of floating piles subjected to NSF with and without shielding by sacrificing piles, and, to study effects of axial load on load transfer mechanism along a single floating pile and shielded center pile within a group of sacrificing piles experiencing locked-in NSF. Based on field monitoring, downdrag developed on floating piles is 70 % more than that on <b>end-bearing</b> piles and neutral plane (NP) is located deeper with stiffer <b>end-bearing</b> layer. Measured maximum β values ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 for piles located inside the <b>end-bearing</b> and floating pile groups. Based on centrifuge tests results, the maximum dragload developed at a single <b>end-bearing</b> pile is 60 % more than that at a single floating pile, whereas downdrag developed on single floating pile is 200 % greater than that on a single <b>end-bearing</b> pile. Both centrifuge and field monitoring results show larger downdrag obtained for floating pile than that of <b>end-bearing</b> pile. From centrifuge modeling results, the measured maximum β value at a single <b>end-bearing</b> and floating pile was similar and slightly smaller than 0. 3. On the other hand, smaller β values of 0. 1 and 0. 2 were mobilized at the shielded center piles for pile spacings of 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, respectively, where D is center pile diameter. Consistent results of β values are obtained between centrifuge modeling and fielding monitoring. The use of a constant β value to estimate dragload on piles will not be realistic as a single β value cannot take into account of the reduction of dragload at the lower part of a pile. Based on centrifuge tests results, NP of a single floating pile was located at around 0. 75 L, where L is embedded pile length into clay stratum. This is consistent with the results as obtained by theoretical solutions, which ranged from 0. 63 - 0. 80 L. The location of NP of shielded center piles {{does not appear to be}} significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles. The measured maximum dragload of the center pile in the group at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing was only 53 % and 75 % of the measured maximum dragload of an isolated single pile, respectively. Correspondingly, the measured downdrag of the center pile was reduced to about 57 % and 80 % of that of the isolated single pile. Deduced ultimate pile capacity of shielded center pile is smaller than that of a single pile. The closer the pile spacing inside the groups, the larger is the reduction in dragload, downdrag as well as ultimate pile capacity of the center pile. This can be explained by numerical simulations of centrifuge modeling. Sacrificing piles "hang-up" the soil between the piles in the group and thus, the vertical and horizontal effective stress in the soil acting on the center pile are reduced. At the same time, smaller confining pressure at the pile tip of a center pile located inside the group causes the smaller soil stiffness and shear strength of soil, so as the ultimate pile capacity of the shielded center pile...|$|E

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of EngineeringThe two basic types of pile foundations are skin friction piles and end- bearing piles. Friction piles resist the applied vertical load by utilising the shear stresses developed along the pile-soil interface, with the <b>end-bearing</b> {{at the tip of}} pile contributing a small proportion of the total pile resistance. <b>End-bearing</b> piles resist the applied vertical loads mainly by end bearing generated at the tip of pile. There are many instances where <b>end-bearing</b> piles piers are constructed with their tip located inside a cavity made in rock strata: such piles are referred to as rock-socketed piles. The resistance developed by rock-socketed piles and piers is partially due to the shearing stresses generated at the pile rock interface {{on the wall of the}} rock cavity and partially due to the end bearing at the tip of the pile. The load that can be carried by the rock socket is usually underestimated in the design practice due the lack of guidance in relevant codes. This thesis presents the findings of the research focused on computational modeling of rock socketed piles conducted to investigate the behavior of such piles. Ax symmetric finite element analyses were conducted to determine the percentages of load resisted by interface shear along the socket wall and <b>end-bearing</b> at pile tip, for various socket length/pile diameter ratios. Different interface conditions were modelled by varying cohesion and friction parameters input to the interface element, as well as by assuming perfect connection between pile and rock material The finite element results obtained are compared with some available field test data to verify the models. Finally a field test procedure is suggested for deriving load carrying capacity of the socket. Findings and further expansion of this research program would be of immense benefit to state and private organizations involved in deep foundation design and construction. It will highlight whether the use of rock-socketed piles can be economically advantageous over the simple end bearing piles with no sockets, and indicate optimum geometries of rock sockets...|$|E

Pile driving formulae, which directly relate the pile set per blow to {{the capacity of the}} pile, {{are commonly}} used to decide whether an installed pile will have the designed capacity.

On the contrary, smaller beta values of 0. 1 and 0. 2 were mobilized at the shielded center piles for pile spacings of 5. 0 d and 6. 0 d, respectively. The measured maximum dragload of the center pile in the group at 5. 0 d and 6. 0 d spacing was only 53 % and 75 % of the measured maximum dragload of an isolated single pile, respectively. Correspondingly, the measured downdrag of the center pile was reduced to about 57 % and 80 % of the isolated single pile. Based on the numerical analyses, it is revealed that sacrificing piles "hang up" the soil between the piles in the group and, thus, the vertical effective stress in the soil so reduced, as is the horizontal effective stress acting on the center pile. This "hang-up" effect reduces with an increase in pile spacing. For a given pile spacing, shielding effect on dragload is larger than that on downdrag...|$|E
40|$|Collapsible soil is {{a special}} type of soil, {{classified}} as problematic soil. It possesses a high strength in the unsaturated phase and loses its strength and exhibits substantial settlement when inundated. Many foundation failures occur around the world, many of which involve loss of lives, caused by problems associated with collapsible soils. One {{of the most commonly}} used type of foundation in collapsible soils is <b>end-bearing</b> piles resting on firm soil strata. However, these piles will be subjected to negative skin friction during wetting of the collapsible soil, inducing additional loads. Various case studies have reported foundation failures and excessive settlements upon the wetting of collapsible soil. Researchers are facing serious challenges in dealing with piles in collapsible soils due to the complexity of the problem and the difficulties associated with modeling this behaviour numerically and experimentally. Relatively few investigations pertinent to pile foundations in collapsible soils subjected to inundation are available in the literature. An experimental investigation was carried out to simulate the complex interaction between collapsible soil and a single <b>end-bearing</b> pile under various wetting and loading conditions. The experimental prototype setup was developed and calibrated in the laboratory in order to measure the drag load and accordingly the negative skin friction acting on the pile’s shaft for given soil/wetting/loading conditions. Collapsible soils with different collapse potential values were created in the laboratory by mixing kaolin clay with fine sand at predetermined ratios. A two-dimensional axi-symmetrical numerical model was generated in order to conduct a parametric study by extending the data for a wider range. The numerical model was validated by experimental results obtained from this study. Based on the results obtained from the experimental and numerical models, a design theory capable of taking into account the effect of soil collapse under different wetting schemed was developed and recommended for use in practice...|$|E
