40|$|We {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} catalog of emission episodes within long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that {{are separated by}} a quiescent period during which gamma-ray emission falls below the background level. We use a fully automated identification method for an unbiased, large scale and expandable search. We examine a comprehensive sample of long GRBs from the BATSE, Swift and Fermi missions, assembling a total searched set of 2710 GRBs, the largest catalog of <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> episodes so far. Our search extends out to [− 1000 s, 750 s] around the burst trigger, expanding the covered time interval beyond previous studies and far beyond the nominal durations (T 90) of most bursts. We compare our results to previous works by identifying pre-peak emission (or precursors), defined as <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> periods prior to the episode with the highest peak luminosity of the burst. We also systematically search for similarly defined periods after the burst’s peak emission. We find that the pre-peak and post-peak emission periods are statistically similar, possibly indicating a common origin. For the analyzed GRBs, we identify 24 % {{to have more than}} one <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> episode, with 11 % having at least one pre-peak event and 15 % having at least one post-peak event. We identify GRB activity significantly beyond their T 90, which can be important for understanding the central engine activity as well as, e. g., gravitational-wave searches...|$|R

40|$|We use a {{high-resolution}} cosmological simulation {{that includes}} hydrodynamics, multiphase star formation, and galactic winds {{to predict the}} distribution of metal line emission at z ∼ 0 from the intergalactic medium (IGM). We focus on two ultraviolet doublet transitions, O VI λλ 1032, 1038 and C IV λλ 1548, 1551.

Luminous regions correspond to volumes that have recently been influenced by galactic winds. We also show that the line emission is clustered on scales ∼ 1 h − 1 Mpc.

In addition to brightness distributions, emission line profiles offer insight into winds, atmospheric escape, energy balance, currents, and plasma properties. Unfortunately, the faintness of many target emissions and the volume limitations of small spacecraft and remote probes limit the opportunities for incorporating a high spectral resolution capability. An emerging technique to address this uses an all-reflective form of the spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS) that combines very high (R> 105) spectral resolution and large étendue in a package small enough to fly as a component instrument on small spacecraft. The large étendue of SHS instruments makes them ideally suited for observations of extended, low surface brightness, <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> line sources, while their intrinsically high spectral resolution enables the study of the dynamical and spectral characteristics described above.

40|$|This {{paper is}} one of a series {{describing}} the Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS). It is shown how the shape of the continuum around the emission line can be used to distinguish between [OII] 3727 at z > 0. 76 and Hα at low redshift in spectra for which only a single <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> line is visible. Based on this, [OII] 3727 is most likely to be the emission line in most of the single emission line galaxies in the CFRS. The statistics of the repeated observations are analyzed to derive an empirical calibration of the reliability of the spectroscopic identifications in the CFRS, to determine how often additional observations could lead to the identification of an initially unidentified object and to provide an estimate of the internal velocity accuracy.

40|$|Relativistic plasma jets are {{observed}} in many accreting black holes. According to theory, coiled magnetic fields {{close to the}} black hole accelerate and collimate the plasma, leading to a jet being launched. <b>Isolating</b> <b>emission</b> from this acceleration and collimation zone is key to measuring its size and understanding jet formation physics. But this is challenging because emission from the jet base cannot be easily disentangled from other accreting components. Here, we show that rapid optical flux variations from a Galactic black-hole binary are delayed with respect to X-rays radiated from close to the black hole by ~ 0. 1 seconds, and that this delayed signal appears together with a brightening radio jet. The origin of these sub-second optical variations has hitherto been controversial. Not only does our work strongly support a jet origin for the optical variations, it also sets a characteristic elevation of <~ 10 ^ 3 Schwarzschild radii for the main inner optical emission zone above the black hole, constraining both internal shock and magnetohydrodynamic models. Similarities with blazars suggest that jet structure and launching physics could potentially be unified under mass-invariant models.

40|$|A {{rigorous}} test of {{our understanding}} of the coupled ionosphere-thermosphere and its response to geomagnetic storms is the ability to reproduce observed storm effects as seen in the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. The concept of compositional change is central to studies of thermosphere response to storm conditions. In particular, information about compositional change within the highly dynamic auroral region is limited. The Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) is designed to view the full auroral region using five filters to <b>isolate</b> <b>emissions</b> from atomic oxygen (1304 and 1356) and N 2 LBH. This spectral resolution allows auroral energy characteristics to be derived by two separate methods from examining ratios of observed intensities (OI 1356 /LBHL or LBHS/LBHL). The LBHS:LBHL ratio is typically used as the mean energy diagnostic since the OI 1356 emission is dependent on changes in the atomic oxygen density, and these changes relative to N 2 can be large. However, once the mean energy has been specified by the LBH ratio, this variability in OI 1356 emission can be exploited as a direct diagnostic of total atomic oxygen column density. This opens the potential of using UVI images to monitor the temporal and spatial response of thermospheric O to high latitude forcing within the auroral regions. Initial results of this type of analysis will be presented along with discussion of its limitations and capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have discovered}} a number of extremely gas-rich very faint dwarf galaxies possibly embedded in low-mass dark matter halos. We investigate star formation histories of these gas-rich dwarf ("almost dark") galaxies both for isolated and interacting/merging cases. We find that although star formation rates (SFRs) are very low (< 10 ^- 5 M_sun/yr) in the simulated dwarfs in isolation for the total halo masses (M_h) of 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 9 M_sun, they can be dramatically increased to be ~ 10 ^{- 4 } M_sun/yr when they interact or merge with other dwarfs. These interacting faint dwarfs with central compact HII regions can be identified as <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> line dots ("ELdots") owing to their very low surface brightness envelopes of old stars. The remnant of these interacting and merging dwarfs can finally develop central compact stellar systems with very low metallicities (Z/Z_sun< 0. 1), which can be identified as extremely metal-deficient ("XMD") dwarfs. These results imply that although there would exist many faint dwarfs that can be hardly detected in the current optical observations, they can be detected as isolated ELdots or XMD dwarfs, when they interact with other galaxies and their host environments. We predict that nucleated ultra-faint dwarfs formed from merging of almost dark dwarfs can be identified as globular clusters owing to the very low surface brightness stellar envelopes, if they are distant objects.

This extended-source X-ray spectrum of unprecedented spectral resolution (lambda/Delta(lambda) approx. 300) permits, for the first time, unabiguous identification and measurement of <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> lines and line complexes alike. The diagnostic power of performing spectroscopy using groups of emission lines from single ions is exemplified.

Both lines are broad (FWHM 700 km/s), extended spatially, and have high equivalent widths (W(A,obs) > 1225 A, 95 % confidence limit; W(B,obs) ~ 150 A). No secondary spectral features are detected for galaxy A. Blue continuum and the marginal detection of a second weak line in the spectrum of galaxy B is consistent with [OII] (the strong line) and MgII (the weak line) at z= 1. 466. By association, galaxy A is likely at z= 1. 464, implying a rest-frame equivalent width of the [OII] emission line in excess of 600 A and a projected separation of 30 kpc for the galaxy pair. Conventional wisdom states that <b>isolated</b> <b>emission</b> lines with rest-frame equivalent widths larger than ~ 200 A are almost exclusively Lyman-alpha.

Recent advances in CCD technology, especially in EM image intensification, {{have made it possible}} to obtain high resolution <b>emission</b> images of <b>isolated</b> spectral <b>emissions</b> from particular flame radicals. These can be used to study emission intensity and distribution, with the aim of correlating combustion emission products with flame spectral emission patterns. ...|$|R
