5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing <b>individual</b> <b>variations.</b>|$|E
5|$|More detail {{was given}} in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain {{heredity}} through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population {{with a range of}} small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.|$|E

However, the corvettes found themselves performing {{a wide range}} of duties, including troop and supply transport, bombardment, assault landings support, survey and hydrography mapping, and providing aid to disabled ships. The Bathursts were seen as 'maids of all work' by the RAN, even though the design was inappropriate for some roles; being too small, too slow, or inadequately armed or equipped. It was not until March 1943 that sufficient ships were available to take the <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> and capabilities of the Bathursts into account: prior to this, the first (and often only) available vessel.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical work {{suggests}} that both negative frequency-dependent payoffs and state-dependent payoffs {{can lead to}} <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in behavioural plasticity. We investigated the roles of both frequency- and state-dependence on the occurrence of <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in behavioural plasticity {{in a series of}} experiments where we manipulated perceived predation danger for red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). We found <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in plasticity in a trait with negative frequency-dependent payoffs (vigilance), but not in a trait with positive frequency-dependent payoffs (escape flights). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the average level of vigilance under low predation danger and the magnitude of response to increased predation danger, as would be expected under state-dependence. Thus, our results provide support for the hypothesis that negative-frequency dependence favours <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in plasticity. However, negative-frequency dependence alone cannot explain why plasticity would be consistent within individuals, and future studies should address the factors that might favour individual consistency. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} assumption, widespread among linguists and non-linguists alike, is that non-standard dialects {{are subject}} to much more <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> than standard varieties. This thesis is concerned with a non-standard dialect of American English called the African-American Vernacular of English (i. e. AAVE) and investigates the amount of <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in this particular variety. The following discussion {{is based on the}} findings of a theoretical study on the use of two grammatical properties, aspectual-Be and the null copula, by speakers of AAVE in the state of Mississippi and demonstrates how successive bilingualism can explain the high degree of <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> typically found in non-standard linguistic varieties...|$|R
25|$|Children come {{equipped}} with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or g factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring g factor in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that g factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of g factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E
500|$|The Weddell seal {{has perhaps}} the most {{elaborate}} vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater contexts. Underwater vocals include trills, chugs, chirps, chugs and knocks. The calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a message. The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to birdsongs and whalesongs. Similar calls have been recorded in other lobodontine seals and in bearded seals. In some pinniped species, {{there appear to be}} geographic differences in vocalizations, known as dialects, while certain species may even have <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> in expression. These differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Otariid females and their young use mother-pup attraction calls to help them reunite when the mother returns from foraging at sea. The calls are described are [...] "loud" [...] and [...] "bawling". Female elephant seals make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Pups may also vocalize when playing, in distress or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>variation</b> in {{behavior}} and physiology {{is a widespread}} and ecologically functional phenomenon in nature in virtually all vertebrate species. Due to domestication of laboratory animals, studies may suffer from a strong selection bias. This paper summarizes behavioral, neuroendocrine and neurobiological studies using the natural <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in rats and mice. Individual behavioral characteristics appear to be consistent over time and across situations. The <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> has at least two dimensions in which {{the quality of the}} response to a challenging condition (coping style) is independent from the quantity of that response (stress reactivity). The neurobiology reveals important differences in the homeostatic control of the serotonergic neuron and the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in relation to coping style. It is argued that a careful exploitation of the broad natural and biologically functional <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> {{in behavior}} and physiology may help in developing better animal models for understanding individual disease vulnerability.

2500|$|An {{individual}} grapheme may {{be represented}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the [...] "same" [...] grapheme. These <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> are known as allographs of a grapheme (compare with the term allophone used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter a has different allographs when written as a cursive, block, or typed letter. The choice of a particular allograph may be influenced by the medium used, the writing instrument, the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's handwriting.|$|E

2500|$|To achieve such {{consistent}} relative differences {{the absolute}} gear ratios {{should be in}} logarithmic progression; most off-the-shelf cogsets do this with small absolute differences between the smaller sprockets and increasingly larger absolute differences as the sprockets get larger. [...] Because sprockets must have a (relatively small) whole number of teeth {{it is impossible to}} achieve a perfect progression; for example the seven derailleur sprockets 14-16-18-21-24-28-32 have an average step size of around 15% but with actual steps varying between 12.5% and 16.7%. The epicyclic gears used within hub gears have more scope for varying the number of teeth than do derailleur sprockets, so {{it may be possible to}} get much closer to the ideal of consistent relative differences, e.g. the Rohloff Speedhub offers 14 speeds with an average relative difference of 13.6% and <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> of around 0.1%.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least seven}} main hunting {{techniques}} {{are known to}} be utilized by the species, with many <b>individual</b> <b>variations</b> and the ability in most mature eagles to quickly (and sometimes cleverly) vary back and forth between methods depending on the circumstance. The first described is “high soar with glide attack”, where the golden eagle soars at least [...] above the earth. Once it spies a prey item, the eagle partially closes its wings and enters a long, low-angled glide which can carry it over distances of [...] with the speed increasing as the wings close more. Just prior to impact, the wings are opened, the tail fanned and feet thrust forward to grab the prey, creating a booming sound, causing by the wings whipping against the wind, in the instant before the strike that sounds like a clap of thunder. This technique is used for solitary or widely dispersed prey found in openings, such as hares or ptarmigans. A variation of the high soar where a lofty perch is used instead of soaring flight has been observed.|$|E
2500|$|Dementia {{becomes more}} common with age. About 3% of people {{between the ages}} of 65 and 74, 19% between 75 and 84, and nearly half of those over 85 years of age have dementia. The {{spectrum}} ranges from mild cognitive impairment to the neurodegenerative diseases of Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. Furthermore, many types of [...] memory may decline with ageing, but not semantic memory or general knowledge such as vocabulary definitions, which typically increases or remains steady until late adulthood [...] (see Ageing brain). Intelligence may decline with age, though the rate may vary depending on the type and may in fact remain steady throughout most of the lifespan, dropping suddenly only as people near the end of their lives. <b>Individual</b> <b>variations</b> in rate of cognitive decline may therefore be explained in terms of people having different lengths of life. There might be changes to the brain: after 20 years of age there may be a 10% reduction each decade in the total length of the brain's myelinated axons.|$|E

40|$|Accounting for <b>{{individual}}</b> <b>variation</b> is {{in itself}} rather complex. The overall {{goal is to be}} able to take account of individual differences (without reducing them to idiosyncrasies) and, identifying regularities, arrive at a synthesis. The attention drawn on different features of <b>individual</b> <b>variation,</b> as well the way that different scholars deal with it, varies according to the field of interest and to the theoretical models' level of abstraction. In different frameworks <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> is from time to time treated as carrying sociological, cultural, cognitive, stylistic, and sometimes psychological values. Exploring the relationships between linguistic features and psychological traits one risks being mired in a swamp: even if it is the layman's common practice to identify individuals in terms of their psychological attributes and to do so relying on their language, the challenge for the linguist is to identify the systematic correlations among the linguistic and psychological aspects. Given these premises, it has seemed useful to adopt an expository strategy referring to those fields of linguistic research in which <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> is taken into consideration, showing how different paradigms account for it, and then referring to those in which the aspects connected to personality factors are investigated...|$|R
