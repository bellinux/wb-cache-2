These “worlds” each describe a different state of the universal wave function and cannot communicate.

500|$|Lennon and Ono co-produced {{the song}} and album with Phil Spector, who commented on the track: [...] "We knew {{what we were going}} to do ... It was going to be John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll <b>just</b> <b>find</b> a sound from [...]" ...|$|E

Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic dubbed it a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded: [...] "Punk, hard rock, indie, and even metal fans owe it to themselves to hear this. Anyone else may be scared off, but may <b>just</b> <b>find</b> they never look at life the same way again. I certainly haven't." ...|$|E

500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] <b>just</b> <b>find</b> something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have {{to be careful not to}} snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You <b>just</b> <b>find</b> dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|Richards was {{surprised}} by the quality of The Age of Kings graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of The Age of Kings as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added [...] "an amazing amount of detail to the actual game". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked [...] "why can't they <b>just</b> <b>find</b> a Frenchman to do a French accent?" [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are [...] "so grand you'll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground". Werner agreed; [...] "the most noticeable graphical advancements", he wrote, were [...] "the sheer size and scale of things". Game Revolution stated [...] "AOE2 is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now".|$|E

500|$|Zombie's {{intention}} was to reinvent Michael Myers because, in his opinion, the character, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's back story and add [...] "new life" [...] to the character. Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation {{as to why he}} wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "as he trying to kill Laurie, or <b>just</b> <b>find</b> her because he loves her?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
500|$|The Blackest Beautiful was {{described}} as a post-hardcore record, much like its predecessors, from [...] "screaming rage to tight, sophisticated harmonies to frenzied funky riffing to emotively melodic parts". Mike Diver of Clash considered it a pop record with clear, melodic structure, while others grouped it with punk rock, soul, and funk, as well as displaying 'glimpses' of other music styles including Afrobeat, electronica and jazz. The incorporation of funk music has been noted by critics. Stephen Hill described the album as [...] "find the space between DC Hardcore and Stax funk". James McMahon described the album as being [...] "dragged through the civil rights movement, through 80s New York block parties, through the birth of hip-hop, funk, jazz and soul." [...] Terry Bezer in Front found that the album has 'as much in common with funk as punk' and wrote in Metal Hammer that the album features 'the musical dexterity and reckless abandon of razor-edged funk'. Letlive's ferocity and use of dynamics have led critics to draw comparisons to rock bands Glassjaw, At the Drive-in, Refused, Black Flag and Deftones. Bezer cited three albums as primary influences on The Blackest Beautiful: Raised Fist's Veil of Ignorance and its [...] "tempo changes, fury and non-stop fire"; Prince's Love Symbol Album and funk style; and Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions for its confrontational and [...] "fight for what's right" [...] lyrics. Butler said that there was a poetic play in their combination of melody and chaos on the album: [...] "I think the best way for us as musicians to get people to listen is to appeal to them. Appeal to the natural rhythm of the head bob, the beating of the heart, the tap of the foot; <b>just</b> <b>find</b> that area and utilize it properly and say something." ...|$|E

[...] "I've slept with girls; I've slept with guys, so I guess that's what they call it! I'm not anti trying to use language to simplify our lives." [...] Palmer has spoken out on feminist issues and about her open relationships, stating in one interview that [...] "I've never been comfortable in a monogamous relationship in my life. I feel like I was built for open relationships just because of the way I function," [...] Palmer explained. [...] "It's not a reactive decision like, 'Hey I'm on the road, you're on the road, let's <b>just</b> <b>find</b> other people.' It was a fundamental building block of our relationship.

2500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{found that}} Ms. Kelly [...] "sounds like an album where Rowland is mostly sorting through some deeply {{personal}} relationship issues {{with a couple}} relatively lighthearted songs thrown in for variety." [...] He noted that [...] "all-around, the album does provide a stronger set of songs than 2002's Simply Deep. The material tends {{to be kind of}} insidious, rather than hitting you immediately or going through one ear and out the other." [...] Giving the album three stars out of five, he also remarked that [...] "the lyrics [...] are direct and specific, going beyond basic breakup material." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani stated that, [...] "this time around, both the production and lyrics are stronger." [...] He praised the [...] "bona fide club jams" [...] on the album. Billboard wrote that while [...] "Rowland may never upstage her superstar groupmate Beyonce, but she certainly has the vocal chops and charm to stand on her own stiletto-clad feet. Compared with her gospel-fueled 2002 solo debut, Rowland appears confident and dominant on foot-stompers [...] though still short of career-defining, Ms. Kelly finds its author opening up more while welcoming the possibility that destiny may <b>just</b> <b>find</b> another star.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to."

50|$|Small finds is {{an archaeological}} term for {{artifacts}} discovered on excavations which are somewhat special {{compared with the}} common finds for that type site or type phase on multi phasic sites. The special nature of the find is dictated by research agendas and the information the artifact can provide. Examples of the increased importance of small finds over other finds would be coins being often thought of as small finds whereas pottery sherd as <b>just</b> <b>finds.</b> The reason is coins can be much more specific {{when it comes to}} dating evidence. Small finds are usually treated differently in the recording system; often they are recorded on plan rather than being attributed to a single context like other generic finds.|$|R
