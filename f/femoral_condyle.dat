5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle</b> in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E

This lesion is relatively rare, with around 20 per 100, 000 boys and girls, and occurs in 70 % of cases between 10 and 20 years. The pathophysiology of this condition remains mysterious. If the radiography usually allows diagnosis, however, it cannot identify the anatomical characteristics of the lesion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} tibiofemoral kinematics after double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions and compare them with those of successful single-bundle reconstructions and contralateral normal knees using open MR images. We obtained MR images based on the flexion angle without weight-bearing, from 20 patients with successful unilateral single-bundle (10 patients) and double-bundle (10 patients) ACL reconstructions with tibialis anterior allografts and a minimum 1 -year follow-up. The MR images of the contralateral uninjured knees were used as normal controls. Sagittal images of the mid-medial and mid-lateral sections of the tibiofemoral compartments were used to measure the translation of the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> relative to the tibia. The mean translations of the medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> on the tibial plateaus during knee joint motion showed no significant differences among normal, single-bundle, and double-bundle ACL reconstructed knees (all p> 0. 05). The mean translations of the lateral <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> showed a significant difference between normal and single-bundle reconstructed knees, or between single-bundle and double-bundle reconstructed knees (p< 0. 05). However, there was no significant difference between normal and double-bundle reconstructed knees (p= 0. 220). These findings suggest that double-bundle ACL reconstruction restores normal kinematic tibiofemoral motion better than single-bundle reconstruction...|$|R

Measurements were performed by two independent observers using an imaging visualization software. The tibial slope averaged 8 ° and 7. 7 °, on the medial and lateral side, respectively (p= 0. 2); the mean posterior offset of <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> was 27. 4 and 25. 2 mm on the two sides, respectively (p= 0. 0001).

Surprisingly, the classical indicators of cursoriality had not evolved in concert with high activity levels. Instead, high runners had larger <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> and reduced directional asymmetry of hindlimb bones.

30|$|Traumatic through-knee or transfemoral amputations with {{concomitant}} ipsilateral femoral fractures {{are extremely}} rare injuries. The initial goal of management is patient resuscitation and stabilization. Subsequent interventions focus on limb salvage {{and the creation}} of a residual limb that can be fitted successfully for a functional lower extremity prosthesis. We present the case of a patient who sustained a traumatic through-knee amputation ipsilateral to an open comminuted femoral fracture. Soft tissue injury prohibited initial primary closure over the distal <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles.</b> A functional residual limb was achieved with acute femoral shortening, maintenance of the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> and fracture stabilization with a short retrograde intramedullary nail. This approach allowed maintenance of muscular attachments to the femur, soft tissue closure and resulted in a residual limb of acceptable length with a broad weight-bearing surface that was fitted with a prosthesis successfully.|$|R

50|$|The {{bones of}} the knee are the femur, patella, tibia, and fibula. The fibula is on the lateral side of the knee and the patella has {{little effect on the}} medial side of the knee. The bony congruity of the medial knee {{consists}} of the opposing surfaces of the medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle</b> and the medial tibial plateau. On the medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle</b> there are three bony landmarks that are important: the medial epicondyle, adductor tubercle, and gastrocnemius tubercle. The medial epicondyle is the most distal and anterior prominence. The adductor tubercle is just proximal and posterior to the medial epicondyle. The gastrocnemius tubercle is just distal and posterior to the adductor tubercle.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} (1) compare the volumes of vastus {{medialis}} (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), vastus intermedius and rectus femoris and {{the ratio of}} VM/VL volumes between asymptomatic controls and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (PFJ OA) participants; and (2) assess the relationships between cross-sectional area (CSA) and volumes of the VM and VL in individuals with and without PFJ OA. Methods: Twenty-two participants with PFJ OA and 11 controls aged ≥ 40 years were recruited from the community and practitioner referrals. Muscle volumes of individual quadriceps components were measured from thigh magnetic resonance (MR) images. The CSA of the VM and lateralis were measured at 10 equally distributed levels (<b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> to lesser <b>femoral</b> trochanter). Results: PFJ OA individuals had smaller normalized VM (mean difference 0. 90 cm ·kg, α = 0. 011), VL (1. 50 cm ·kg, α = 0. 012) and rectus femoris (0. 71 cm ·kg, α = 0. 009) volumes than controls. No differences in the VM/VL ratio were observed. The CSA at the third level (controls) and fourth level (PFJ OA) above the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> best predicted VM volume, whereas the VL volume was best predicted by the CSA at the seventh level (controls) and sixth level (PFJ OA) above the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles.</b> Conclusion: Reduced quadriceps muscle volume was a feature of PFJ OA.

50|$|The {{adductor}} magnus tendon {{attaches to}} the distal medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle</b> just posterior and proximal to the adductor tubercle. It has a fascial expansion on the distal-medial aspect that {{attaches to the}} medial gastrocnemius tendon, capsular arm of the POL, and posteromedial joint capsule. The thick distal lateral aspect attaches to the medial supracondylar ridge. The adductor magnus tendon is an excellent, consistent landmark because it is rarely injured. The vastus medialis obliquus muscle courses over the anteromedial thigh, attaching along the adductor magnus anterior border and to the quadratus femoris tendon. The medial gastrocnemius tendon arises proximal and posterior to the gastrocnemius tubercle of the medial <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle.</b> This is another important landmark because it is rarely injured and attaches close to the capsular arm of the POL, thus helping the surgeon locate the femoral attachment of the POL.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{injury to the}} lateral <b>femoral</b> <b>condyle</b> is an {{osteochondral}} fracture combined with a patellar dislocation.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{models of}} osteoarthritis in rats {{are used to}} study the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis. Many mechanically induced models have the limitation that permanent joint instability is induced by e. g. ligament transection or meniscal damage. This permanent instability will counteract the potential beneficial effects of therapy. The groove model of osteoarthritis uses a one-time trigger, surgically induced cartilage damage on the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles,</b> and has been validated for the canine tibia-femoral compartment. The present study evaluates this model for the rat knee joint. The articular cartilage of the weight bearing surface of both <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles</b> and trochlea were damaged (grooved) without damaging the underlying subchondral bone. Severity of joint degeneration was histologically assessed, in addition to patella cartilage damage and subchondral bone characteristics by means of (contrast-enhanced) micro-CT. Mild histological degeneration of the surgically untouched tibial plateau cartilage was observed in addition to damage of the <b>femoral</b> <b>condyles,</b> without clear synovial tissue inflammation. Contrast enhanced micro-CT demonstrated proteoglycan loss of the surgically untouched patella cartilage. Besides, a more sclerotic structure of the subchondral bone was observed. The tibia-femoral groove model in a rat results in mild knee joint degeneration, without permanent joint instability and joint inflammation. This makes the rat groove model a useful model to study the onset and progression of post-traumatic non-inflammatory osteoarthritis, creating a relatively sensitive model to study disease modifying osteoarthritic drugs.
