5000|$|In October 2003, Gagnon sent AMS a cease-and-desist letter, {{claiming}} {{that the use of}} the programs was unauthorized, and demanded AMS to remove [...] "all original and derivative source code" [...] from AMS computers. AMS responded by asserting that Gagnon could not unilaterally stop AMS from using and updating the programs because it had an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>license</b> to use, copy, and modify the programs based on the course of conduct of the parties over the past two-and-a-half years. AMS also stated that Gagnon could not use the programs because it contained AMS's trade secrets. In addition, AMS declined to pay Gagnon the $1.75 and $2 million that Gagnon had requested in September.|$|E
50|$|The Ninth Circuit thus {{affirmed the}} {{district}} court, holding that AMS had an implied unlimited, <b>irrevocable</b> <b>license</b> {{for the computer}} programs. Although 17 U.S.C. §204 requires that exclusive licenses be in writing, a court will grant an implied license when: (1) the licensee requests creation of the work; and (2) the licensor makes that particular work and delivers it to the requesting licensee. Here, Gagnon conceded that he created the programs specifically for AMS in response to AMS's request and that AMS paid for the work. The court also held that Gagnon delivered the programs when he installed them onto the AMS computers and stored the source code on-site at AMS, and that his intent to deliver was manifested by his conduct, including the executed TSA, the OVA which he submitted, and his ongoing technical support to AMS.|$|E
