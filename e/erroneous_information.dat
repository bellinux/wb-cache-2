The encoding and decoding procedures of the ICSIE are proposed, based on the syndrome decoding. Then, we derive the bounds on the optimal codelength of the proposed index code with <b>erroneous</b> side <b>information.</b> Furthermore, we introduce a special graph for the proposed index coding problem, called a δ_s-cycle whose properties {{are similar to those of}} the cycle in the conventional index coding problem.

25|$|On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck {{navigational aids}} {{at the end}} of runway 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft's landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two {{passengers}} were seriously injured by metal components of the runway approach light pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined that the cause of the accident was <b>erroneous</b> <b>information</b> from the flight dispatcher to the crew members regarding weight and runway length.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{stringent}} impairments in matched-field processing {{is the impact of}} missing or <b>erroneous</b> environmental <b>information</b> on the final source location estimate. This problem is known in the literature as model mismatch and is strongly frequency dependent. Another unavoidable factor that contributes to model mismatch is the natural time and spatial variability of the ocean waveguide. As a consequence, most of the experimental results obtained to date focus on short source-receiver ranges (usually < 5 km), stationary sources, reduced time windows and frequencies generally below 600 Hz. This paper shows that MFP source localization can be made robust to time–space environmental mismatch if the parameters responsible for the mismatch are clearly identified, properly modeled and (time-) adaptively estimated by a focalization procedure prior to MFP source localization. The data acquired during the ADVENT’ 99 sea trial at 2, 5, and 10 km source-receiver ranges and in two frequency bands, below and above 600 Hz, provided an excellent opportunity to test the proposed techniques. The results indicate that an adequate parametrization of the waveguide is effective up to 10 km range in both frequency bands achieving a precise localization during the whole recording of the 5 km track, and most of the 10 km track. It is shown that the increasing MFP dependence on <b>erroneous</b> environmental <b>information</b> in the higher frequency and at longer ranges can only be accounted for by including a time dependent modeling of the water column sound speed profile.

2500|$|The {{background}} from which erupted the Six-Day War {{was caused by}} an <b>erroneous</b> <b>information</b> given to Nasser from the Soviet intelligence services that Israel was amassing troops near the Israeli-Syrian border.

40|$|The ADVENT' 99 sea trial {{took place}} {{in the area of the}} Adventure Bank in the Strait of Sicily during May 1999, with the {{objective}} of testing matched-field processing (MFP) techniques. A 62 m aperture - 31 hydrophone vertical line array was deployed at 2, 5 and 10 km from an acoustic source. The source was emitting a series of multi-tone signals alternating with LFM sweeps in two frequency bands: 200 - 700 Hz and 800 - 1600 Hz. One of the most stringent impairments in MFP is the impact of missing or <b>erroneous</b> environmental <b>information</b> on the final source location estimate. This problem is known in the literature as model mismatch and is strongly frequency dependent. A number of MFP processors have been proposed to cope with inevitable model mismatch in real data. The approach taken in this paper includes a incoherent broadband conventional Bartlett processor used in a two step procedure: in the first step the data is pre-focused using genetic search where the environmental and geometric parameters are estimated and in the second step an exhaustive search is performed for source range and depth. This method showed to be effective up to 10 km range in the higher frequency band achieving a precise localization during the whole recording of the 5 km track, and most of the 10 km track.

40|$|Abstract ― Target {{tracking}} {{is one of}} the key {{applications of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that forms basis for numerous other applications. Real situations in tracking, such as an unexpected change in the mobile event’s direction, failure of event detection, or transmission failure of an error message may result into <b>erroneous</b> tracking <b>information.</b> Thus, in order to prevent and handle errors effectively, it is required that tracking algorithm must incorporate error avoidance and error correction phase. In this paper we present Dead Reckoning (DR) based target tracking protocol. DR determines target’s present position by projecting its past positions and speed over elapsed time and known target's path. Moreover, it inherits the functionality of error correction and error avoidance using a position fix technique. The performance of DR based tracking is also discussed, which confirms the efficacy of the algorithm...|$|R
