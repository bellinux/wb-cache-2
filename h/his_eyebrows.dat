5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. <b>His</b> <b>eyebrows</b> were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

50|$|Ibn Sireen has said: “I asked ‘Abīdah as Salmaani {{about the}} {{statement}} of Allah: “O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and {{the women of the}} believers to draw their Jalābīb all over their bodies…” So he took his garment and covered his head and his face but he covered his left eye, leaving the right eye exposed. Then he drew his garment from above making it close to <b>his</b> <b>eyebrow,</b> or upon <b>his</b> <b>eyebrow.</b>|$|R

5|$|Max Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in Max Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in Max Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When Max has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and out of focus. Since Max Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> to react to different scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
60|$|Mr Pecksniff {{brought up}} to the top of the pew, by slow degrees, his hair, <b>his</b> forehead, <b>his</b> <b>eyebrow,</b> <b>his</b> eye. She was sitting on a bench beside the door with her hands before her face; and Tom was bending over her.|$|R

25|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, Gríma {{was played}} by Brad Dourif. According to Dourif, Jackson {{encouraged}} him to shave off <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character.|$|E
25|$|Each {{role has}} its own style of make-up: the clown has a large white spot {{in the middle of}} his face, for example. A sick {{character}} has a thin red line pointing upwards in between <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows.</b> Aggressive and frustrated character roles often have an arrow shape fading into the forehead in between the eyebrows (英雄脂; jing1 hung4 zi1).|$|E
25|$|Bishen Singh Bedi, {{the under}} {{pressure}} {{captain of the}} Indian cricket team, was not convinced the Vaseline was to keep sweat out of the eyes. He said Lever had used unfair means to shine the ball. The English paceman’s habit of rubbing the ball over <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> {{every now and then}} was also noticed. Tests on the cricket ball revealed presence of greasy substance. Whether the Vaseline had been intentionally applied to the ball or not was later disputed, and Lever's previous performances on the tour questioned.|$|E

25|$|He was hit {{again in}} July 1969. Unusually, {{he was hit}} while in his truck, driving on a {{mountain}} road—the metal body of a vehicle normally protects people in cases such as this by acting as a Faraday cage. The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into the open window of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious and burned off <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a cliff edge.|$|E
25|$|The Rohirrim's {{capital of}} Edoras took {{six months to}} build on Mount Sunday, with {{thatched}} roofs, but that was simply the exterior: the buildings doubled as offices and lunch halls. The army created a road to the location, whilst the interior was filmed at Stone Street Studios with tapestries designed by Lee, and Théoden's wooden throne partly created by his daughter. Hill endured heavy make-up for the possession scene where his skin was pulled back and released for increased wrinkles. Dourif shaved off <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and put potato flakes as dandruff in his hair for unnerving effect.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
50|$|In the 1948 final against Miklós Szilvási Andersson cut <b>his</b> <b>eyebrow</b> while leading 3:0. The referee {{allowed the}} bout to {{continue}} despite strong bleeding, and Andersson {{won the gold}} medal. He lost to Szilvási in the 1952 Olympic final.|$|R

25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later singed <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E
25|$|The greasepaint {{mustache}} and eyebrows originated spontaneously {{prior to a}} vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his {{mustache and}} eyebrows.|$|E
25|$|Only in {{his early}} thirties, Captain Schofield is renowned for his level-headed {{demeanor}} and reflexes that afford him the ability {{to come out of}} devastating conflict alive. His callsign comes from two vertical scars that run from <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> to his cheeks, over his eyes, wounds he sustained while he was a Harrier pilot for the Marine Corps in Serbia. Although his rank is well below many others in the story, he frequently takes command of the entire United States military; the President personally agreeing to this due to Schofield having saved his life the preceding year. Often resorting to very dangerous strategies to win a battle, it has become the norm for any attempt on his life to end with him escaping while the surrounding environment is more or less demolished. He commands a recon unit of Marines called to aid the Russian government - a trap designed to lead to his death. Upon discovering M-12's plot to change world order, he embarks upon a campaign to ruin the Chameleon and Kormoran projects. He is the protagonist in four Matthew Reilly novels and a novella, Scarecrow being the third novel.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans were}} brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears’ famous account Robertson’s face “went the colour of {{mahogany}} … <b>his</b> <b>eyebrows</b> slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit” He shouted “Get ‘Aig!”. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson’s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them {{that he had the}} authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle’s demands were “excessive”, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson “ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting “the wonderful army” under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one could order him to”. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.|$|E

His eyes burned with constant passion, and his lips were full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in his smile. He smiled often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E
60|$|The man in {{the doorway}} struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near <b>his</b> right <b>eyebrow.</b> <b>His</b> scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.|$|R
