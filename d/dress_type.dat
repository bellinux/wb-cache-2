40|$|Background/Aims: Many {{patients}} {{are exposed to}} additional risks because access is via a central venous catheter (CVC). Despite a paucity of evidence, guidelines and policies dictated the use of transparent exit site wound dressings, contrary to local nurses' practice. This study aimed to explore nurses' experiences with three different types of CVC exit site dressings {{in the context of}} a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Seven focus groups were held with haemodialysis nurses across the Renal Service following data collection for the crossover RCT. Four key questions were explored and thematic analysis of the transcripts was undertaken. Results: Fifteen nurses, with varying haemodialysis experience, provided comments on the ease of applying and removing the dressings, problems encountered with the dressings, which dressings types they thought were best or worst, and the value of having a specific work practice instruction developed for the RCT. It was clear that, although no <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> was perfect, the opaque dressing was the best given the properties of the dressings, the patients' preferences, and the humid climate. Conclusion: These perspectives are congruent with the results from the RCT that the opaque <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> is safer than the transparent <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> for these patients. It is suggested that necessary steps are taken to incorporate these local findings in to the health service's policy to reflect current state and national guidelines...|$|R

However, {{there are several other}} trials showing the effect of <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> to be negative and the question remains as to whether post-operative pin site dressings are important. With regard to pin site care, commencement of dressing changes on POD 2 – 3 may be convenient, as the drainage associated with pin site reaction normally decreases by this time.

40|$|Introduction Students of {{each country}} are the next {{generation}} of that. Making decision about educational, teaching and training programs is of crucial importance. Thus each country can consider suitable approach toward students for making decisions about them (codifying them). One of the methods is transferring concepts via educational routes. It refers to the messages which are conveyed by text books, educational rules, pictures in the books, etc. Presupposition of the government is that, students perceive these messages as they are. Actually students are considered as reactive agents who consume these messages. But we must know that we are living in an era in which a person's life is exposed to different information sources such as: family values, peer groups, mass media etc. Thus an individual has changed form a reactive to an active agent who can chose and has his own perception of different messages. Resistance or reproductions are two different decoding methods for messages. The aim of the present study is analyzing comparatively the textbooks content among Iran and Syria as a representation of the formal culture of Veil. Content analysis is {{used in the present study}} to analyze 2075 pictorial data included in text books in primary and guidance school in Iran and in Syria. Materials and MethodsAfter victory of Islamic revolution in 1357, big changes happened in cultural foundation of the society. The Governments by making use of such institutions especially education system and schools has injected its own view point to the people. Different events, such as Cultural Revolution in universities, correction of text books all show that individuals in the society have become familiar with the principals of Islamic concepts and political views. In the present study views of Antonio Gramsci, Piere Bourdieu and Michal Foucault have been used in order to construct a framework for analysis of the messages perceived from books. According to Gramsci hegemony is domination of one social group over another social group. The governing social group by using different tools, life style, thinking method, value system, etc would inject itself to the governed social group and the governed group accept them in order to join other social groups. Gramsci by creating some concepts such as civil society, hegemony and cultural management tried to refer to a system which although its principals are close to the governing group but it has formed according to a cultural agreement between other social groups. Contrary to the past which force brought domination, today cultural tools such as education system, cultural centers, books, schools can boost domination. Bourdieu says that why symbolic order is accepted by everyone although this order can stop progression and development. Violence Symbolic gives this opportunity to the governing class to define reality in its own favorite way thus control its position. In fact according to Bourdiue Violence Symbolic has a complete connection with symbolic source. This symbolic power is a potential for using power, thus people will control their behaviors extensively and try to adopt with sources of violence. It must be mentioned that all these cases must be produced in dialogue environment which shows and transfers views, norms, ideas and rules of the governing class. Foucault is perception of dialogue can shows that civil society and institutions within it or even agents acting in it would likely to do what actions and express what issues. Although dialogue differs from ideology but resistance against dialogue is in fact questioning ideology which based on the dialogue has formed. As the definition of one word is different in different cultures, the meaning can also differ in different dialogues, even they can also differ in different dialogues and they can be paradoxical. In fact dialogue is one of the specific problematic issues about ideology. In this study the pictorial content of text books in Iran and Syria was assessed by content analysis technique. Both two countries are Islamic ones and has republic governmental system. Although their primary view points about world are similar, but there are big difference between the appearance and veil of their population. Veil rule was passed after Islamic revolution and all people have to obey it. But in Syria there is no specific rule for Veil. The present study has examined 2075 pictorial data of educational text books in Iran and in Syria. Pictures were extracted by codifying them by the researcher and after codifying them they were delivered to SPSS software for analyzing the data. Totally, 2057 records from 1104 picture in 21 textbooks from primary and guidance school were gathered. Content analysis was used to analyze obtained data. In was tried to analyze messages conveyed by these pictures. The messages were codified by education system and students were supposed to decode them. Discussion of results and conclusions: Veil features (variables) which were selected were categorized as following: hair style, head style, type and color of the Veil which covers head, type and color of the <b>dress,</b> <b>type</b> and color of the pants, type and color of the shoe. They were classified based on sex in three different age groups in 21 text book. Thus by combining the above features (variables), it can be observed that the formal common Veil in examined books in Iran is "shirts with high sleeves, coat, pants, shoes in dark colors, beard and mustache" for men and "Maghnae (a kind of scarf), Chador (a kind of Veil covering all the body), Manto (a kind of dress), Pants and shoes in dark colors" for women. In Syria, "Coat and pants, tie, shoe and mustache" for men and shirt and skirt, long dress, shoe and slipper" for women. These kinds of Veils are advertised by the governing group. Education system uses text book as a tool for transferring intended concepts, in fact they are an ideological tool at the service of political aims of the government. Audience as will be referred to in different parts of the study would decode the message or in fact reproduce them or even resist against them. A point which must be emphasized is that resistance must not be considered in its negative sense but it means that limitations of message because of creativity in decoding by audience is put away and another form of the message (different from what it was produced) is perceived. Governments for holding social order and controlling affairs, use cultural tools such as schools, books magazines, local communities, cinema etc, and gradually replace them for some ordering organizations like police force. Although having some levels of Violence is necessary for holding order in society but government try to convey their ideological principals by using cultural tools which are accepted among people. They use hegemony and internal satisfaction of people instead using power. It results in formation of civil society inside political systems which by cultural management will continue their domination. Human resources in each country are the most important force for development and expansion of the country. Great investment must be done in this field and planning must consider all different aspects. As it was mentioned each country identifies all its principals, values, norms and rules based on a specific dialogue. But it must be mentioned that people are not located only (students) in a closed environment named school and education system. Especially today, Internet, satellite, different cultural, scientific sites are available to them and surround them. Each one is trying to convey its own concept to the individual. In formation of sources are paradoxical, rejecting each other, thus people faces a big world of paradoxes. This issue and high speed of change result in a gap between the organizational culture and other cultures provided by other informal sources this results in different perceptions about a transferred concept. The person has changed into an active resistance against it, and he/she has different perceptions and readings of them. One of the conveyed concepts by book is Veil. Each country reflects this concept according to its principals and norms...|$|E

The healing rates of twelve leg ulcer patients treated with simple nonadherent dressings (e. g., NA Ultra) were compared with an equal number of patients treated with modern dressings to determine differences in healing rates and cost. Main Outcome Measures. Rate of healing as determined by reduction in ulcer area over a specified period of time and total cost of dressing per patient. Results. Simple nonadherent dressings had a mean healing rate of 0. 353 [*]cm 2 /week (standard deviation ± 0. 319) compared with a mean of 0. 415 [*]cm 2 /week (standard deviation ± 0. 383) for more expensive dressings. This resulted in a one-tailed p value of 0. 251 and a two-tailed p value of 0. 508. Multiple regression analysis gave a significance F of 0. 8134. Conclusion.

40|$|Queensland Health {{guidelines}} for {{central venous catheter}} (CVC) exit site management recommend using transparent dressings. However, the appropriateness of these dressings in tropical climates has been challenged in a regional haemodialysis unit due to perceived difficulties with moisture accumulation between haemodialysis sessions. This paper aims to review the literature on best dressing practice in reducing incidence of catheter-related infections in patients receiving haemodialysis through a CVC, and will explore the evidence specifically related to tropical climates. Electronic database searches were conducted using the specific search terms: central venous catheter; haemodialysis; tropics; exit site; dressing; transparent; Primapore, IV 3000; sepsis. Some 152 articles were initially retrieved. Of these, 135 articles did not specifically relate to exit site dressings, leaving 11 review and six research articles that {{were included in the}} literature review. Exit site dressing articles predominantly compared gauze with transparent dressings. The evidence of a causal relationship between transparent dressings and risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections was inconclusive, although transparent dressings may increase the risk of catheter tip colonisation and promote moisture and bacterial proliferation on peripheral cannulation sites. No articles addressed CVC management in the tropics. There was limited evidence to suggest infection rates were higher using transparent compared with non-transparent (gauze) dressings. No studies were found that investigated the effectiveness of either <b>dressing</b> <b>type,</b> or an appropriate dressing protocol, for the tropics. Further research is required to determine the most effective <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> for use on haemodialysis CVC exit sites in the tropics...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} pain and stress {{experiences}} of patients with chronic wounds being treated with atraumatic vs conventional dressings at dressing change. Method: This exploratory study adopted an independent samples design to identify any differences between reported levels of pain and stress {{associated with the use}} of atraumatic and conventional dressings used in treatment regimens of patients with chronic wounds. Physiological and psychological assessments of pain and stress were recorded at dressing change (including numerical ratings, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, GSR, salivary cortisol and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire surveys). Results: In total, 49 patients with chronic wounds took part in the study. Fifty-three percent of patients were male (n= 26) and 47 % were female (n= 23). Patients were aged 38 - 95 years, with a mean age of 69. 11 Â± 14. 08 years. Overall, 10 patients were receiving atraumatic dressings with Safetac technology as part of their routine wound treatment and 39 were receiving conventional dressings. Patients receiving atraumatic dressings reported significantly lower numerical pain and stress ratings and experienced significantly lower GSR at dressing change. Mean heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol were also lower for patients with atraumatic dressings. However, patients' PSS (atraumatic= 24. 60, conventional= 22. 72) and STAI (atraumatic= 34. 90, conventional= 33. 21) scores were similar for both <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> groups. Conclusion: This study provides a basis for understanding how different <b>dressing</b> <b>types</b> can impact pain and stress at dressing change. Acute episodes of pain and stress were much lower in patients receiving atraumatic dressings; 0 however factors associated with the overall experience of living with a chronic wound may be contributing to underlying and ongoing feelings of stress and anxiety. The impact of these implications on selection of dressings and cost of care are also discussed. Declaration of interest: This research was commissioned by MÃ¶lnlycke Health Care.

40|$|Background: Foot ulcers {{in people}} with {{diabetes}} mellitus are a common and serious global health issue. Dressings form {{a key part of}} ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. Objectives: To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of dressings for healing foot ulcers {{in people with}} diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: theCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1);OvidMEDLINE (In-Process&OtherNon-Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance. Main results: We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between <b>dressing</b> <b>types,</b> but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between <b>dressing</b> <b>types</b> for any secondary outcomes assessed.

50|$|In modern-day 21st century, {{medicine}} has evolved to involve past treatments, such as leech therapy, {{as well as}} advancing wound prevention and the treatment. A large part of wound care is wound treatment. This involves promoting healing, preventing infections, and getting rid of an already existent infection. Deciding on a treatment, depends {{on the type of}} wound that a person has sustained. Varying from infections, to burns, wound care is a priority in saving the limb, extremity, or life of a person. In a hospital or medical care setting, more severe wounds like diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers, and burns, require sterile, or clean (depending on the severity of the wound) dressings and wound care. The <b>types</b> of wound <b>dressing</b> include: dry dressings, wet-to-dry dressings, chemical-impregnated dressings, foam dressings, alginate dressings, hydrofiber dressings, transparent film dressings, hydrogel dressings, and hydrocolloid dressings.

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and {{pressure}} injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers {{and there are many}} options to choose from including alginate dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use for the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular <b>dressing</b> <b>type.</b> OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of alginate dressings for treating pressure ulcers in any care setting. METHODS: Search methods: For this review, in April 2015 we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. Selection criteria: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of alginate with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (stage II or above). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (336 participants) in this review; all studies had two arms. The included studies compared alginate dressings with six other interventions that included: hydrocolloid dressings, silver containing alginate dressings, and radiant heat therapy. Each of the six comparisons included just one study and these had limited participant numbers and short follow-up times. All the evidence was of low or very low quality. Where data were available {{there was no evidence of}} a difference between alginate dressings and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The relative effects of alginate dressings compared with alternative treatments are unclear. The existing trials are small, of short duration and at risk of bias.

Although the daimyō were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for military and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted {{the wealth of the}} daimyōs, thus weakening their threat to the central administration.

The daimyōs did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, bureaucrats and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.|$|R

Since the establishment of moist wound healing in the 1960 s, several types of wound dressings have been developed. However, the evidence for effectiveness when comparing various types of wound dressings is limited. Objectives: The purpose of this review is 1) to provide a general description {{of the role of}} foam in wound therapy and 2) to evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of foam dressings compared to other frequently used products. Summary and conclusion: Foam has {{a significant role in the}} clinical {{management of}} chronic wounds and in moist wound healing. There are only a few randomized controlled trials, which in general, show no significant difference in the healing effect of different <b>dressing</b> <b>types.</b> The choice of wound dressing should therefore be based on clinical evaluation of the wound and the periwound skin.

To compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of simple nonadherent dressings with other more expensive <b>dressing</b> <b>types</b> {{in the treatment}} of venous leg ulcers. Study Design. Retrospective cohort study. Location. The leg ulcer clinic at the University Hospital of South Manchester. Subjects and Methods. The healing rates of twelve leg ulcer patients treated with simple nonadherent dressings (e. g., NAUltra) were compared with an equal number of patients treated with modern dressings to determine differences in healing rates and cost. Main Outcome Measures. Rate of healing as determined by reduction in ulcer area over a specified period of time and total cost of dressing per patient. Results. Simple nonadherent dressings had a mean healing rate of 0. 353 cm 2 /week (standard deviation ± 0. 319) compared with a mean of 0. 415 cm 2 /week (standard deviation ± 0. 383) for more expensive dressings. This resulted in a one-taile...|$|R
30|$|Does {{the type}} of pin site {{dressing}} influence infection rate? Although many investigators have looked into this, a conclusion on the efficacy of certain dressings alone is not possible because the study groups differ in other aspects of pin site care or surgical technique. Seven randomized trials were identified that were designed to specifically evaluate the efficacy of various dressings in reducing pin site infection rate [1, 4, 15, 18, 37, 60, 61]. Lee and colleagues [60] determined that pin infection rate was lower in patients undergoing limb lengthening procedures with a polyhexamethylene biguanide dressing as compared to dry gauze (1.0 versus 4.5  %, respectively); however, no deep infections occurred in either group. Ogbemudia et al. [61] concluded that a 1  % silver sulphadiazine dressing reduced pin track infection rates in a population comprised mostly of trauma patients (1.9  % of pin sites, as compared to 14.2  % with dry gauze). However, Yuenyongviwat and Tangtrakulwanich [1] found no differences between these <b>dressing</b> <b>types</b> {{in the setting of}} tibial external fixators used for trauma (46.7  % of patients with pin track infections with silver sulphadiazine dressings versus 40.0  % with dry gauze).|$|R
30|$|Lethaby et al. [25] {{published}} a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis that pooled {{the data of}} the three negative studies by Egol [15], Henry [20], and Patterson [37]. The meta-analysis considered the outcome of pin site infection rate and was based upon two study groups: 1) patients receiving any type of pin site cleansing solution versus 2) patients receiving no cleansing regimen [25]. These two broad groups were chosen for the meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity between the three studies chosen for the analysis used different control pin site care protocols and tested different <b>dressing</b> <b>types.</b> There was insufficient {{evidence to suggest that}} the use of pin site cleansing solutions reduces pin site infection rates (relative risk (RR) 2.30, 95  % confidence interval 0.63 – 8.33) [25]. Although the authors employed specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, they maintained this conclusion may be difficult to interpret given that the meta-analysis was based upon small, non-blinded, heterogeneous studies at a high risk of bias. Five years after publication of this meta-analysis, an additional Cochrane review drew similar conclusions that there was insufficient evidence to promote any specific strategy of pin site infection prophylaxis [59].|$|R
40|$|This {{systematic}} review considers the evidence supporting {{the use of}} prophylactic dressings {{for the prevention of}} pressure ulcer. Electronic database searches were conducted on 25 July 2013. The searches found 3026 titles and after removal of duplicate records 2819 titles were scanned against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 2777 were excluded based on their title and abstract primarily because they discussed pressure ulcer healing, the prevention and treatment of other chronic and acute wounds or where the intervention was not a prophylactic dressing (e. g. underpads, heel protectors and cushions). Finally, the full text of 42 papers were retrieved. When these 42 papers were reviewed, 21 were excluded and 21 were included in the review. The single high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) and the growing number of cohort, weak RCT and case series all suggest that the introduction of a dressing as part of pressure ulcer prevention may help reduce pressure ulcer incidence associated with medical devices especially in immobile intensive care unit patients. There is no firm clinical evidence at this time to suggest that one <b>dressing</b> <b>type</b> is more effective than other dressing...|$|R
