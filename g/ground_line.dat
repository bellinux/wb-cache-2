Although the other Amazon along {{this part of the}} frieze not already pitted against a foe is {{standing}} directly left of Telamon (BM 533:3), she cannot be his target, for she stands on a different <b>ground</b> <b>line</b> from Telamon and must be understood to be in a deeper spatial plane. As Telamon aims his spear at a distant enemy, so she aims her arrow past Telamon, probably at the Greek on the preceding slab, BM 536:3, who is about to drag off an Amazon. The Amazon Telamon is aiming at is dressed like Melanippe in an overgirt peplos, again probably a signifier of royalty. As Hippolyte will be seen later fighting Herakles, and Melanippe has already been slain, this Amazon may be identified as Antiope. The three slabs that comprise the south portion of the frieze, BM 542, BM 541, and BM 540, form a unit focusing on the figure of Herakles, BM 54l:3. The hero takes a prominent place, on the long axis of the temple and over the Corinthian capital, while {{at either end of the}} trio of slabs are balancing pairs of a Greek and an Amazon helping away wounded comrades, BM 542:1 and 2, and BM 540:5 and 4. Hippolyte, like the two other queens, is distinguished by dress. She wears a mantle wrapped about her waist, visually drawing attention to the disputed belt.|$|E

[...] Upton writes that a [...] "clearly defined diamond" [...] is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof.

A spur-like protrusion, fold, or tuft extends from her calves just below the knee, which Collon interprets as dewclaws. Below the shin, the figure's legs change into those of a bird. The bird-feet are detailed, with three long, well-separated toes of approximately equal length. Lines have been scratched into the surface of the ankle and toes to depict the scutes, and all visible toes have prominent talons. Her toes are extended down, without perspective foreshortening; they do not appear to rest upon a <b>ground</b> <b>line</b> and thus give the figure an impression of being dissociated from the background, as if hovering.|$|E

The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of simple versions of existing marine ice sheet models to simulate <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> migration. In particular, we investigate the response of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> to external forcing and the sensitivity of the models' predictions to their numerics and the mechanical coupling between ice sheet and shelf. From the model comparison, there is no consensus on how the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> should react to changes in boundary conditions. A crucial finding is the strong dependency of models using a fixed grid on numerical details such as the horizontal grid size. This implies that we should be very wary about <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> predictions from such models. Including mechanical coupling at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> does not seem to change the qualitative behavior of the models. This suggests that the way the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> is treated in marine ice sheet models dominantly determines the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> dynamics.

Fixed grid ice sheet models {{have been shown to}} exhibit inconsistent and hence unreliable <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> migration behaviour, except at very high resolution not achievable in whole ice sheet simulations. In this study we present several different approaches to parameterising the <b>grounding</b> <b>line.</b> These are distinguished by choices regarding the ice thickness profile from the last grounded to the first floating grid point, and how this profile is allowed to impact on the gravitational driving stress and basal drag. We demonstrate that the most obvious choice of thickness parameterisation, linear interpolation from the last grounded to the first floating grid point, is not the most effective. We show that use of a <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> parameterisation greatly improves performance, and that choice of a better <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> parameterisation over a simpler one can bring further improvements, in terms of both accuracy and more self consistent behaviour, comparable to halving the grid resolution.

It is shown that ice-shelf buttressing can restore stability under these conditions. Ice flux at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> is, in general, not a monotonically increasing function of ice thickness. This, possibly at first somewhat counterintuitive result, is found to be fully consistent with recent theoretical work. <b>Grounding</b> <b>lines</b> on retrograde slopes are conditionally stable, and the stability regime is a non-trivial function of bed and ice-shelf geometry.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the flow of}} marine-terminating outlet glaciers that are laterally confined in a channel of prescribed width. In that case, the drag exerted by the channel side walls on a floating ice shelf can reduce extensional stress at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line.</b> If ice flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> increases with both ice thickness and extensional stress, then a longer shelf can reduce ice flux by decreasing extensional stress. Consequently, calving {{has an effect on}} flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> by regulating the length of the shelf. In the absence of a shelf, it plays a similar role by controlling the above-flotation height of the calving cliff. Using two calving laws, one due to Nick et al.  (2010) based on a model for crevasse propagation due to hydrofracture and the other simply asserting that calving occurs where the glacier ice becomes afloat, we pose and analyse a flowline model for a marine-terminating glacier by two methods: direct numerical solution and matched asymptotic expansions. The latter leads to a boundary layer formulation that predicts flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> as a function of depth to bedrock, channel width, basal drag coefficient, and a calving parameter. By contrast with unbuttressed marine ice sheets, we find that flux can decrease with increasing depth to bedrock at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line,</b> reversing the usual stability criterion for steady <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> location. Stable steady states can then have <b>grounding</b> <b>lines</b> located on retrograde slopes.
