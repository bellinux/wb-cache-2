40|$|Abstract. In medical {{clinical}} trials, overall trial {{results are}} highlighted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstracts</b> of papers/reports. These results are summaries of underlying statistical analysis {{where most of}} the time normal distributions are assumed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis. It is common for clinicians to focus on <b>the</b> information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstracts</b> <b>in</b> order to review or integrate several clinical trial results that address the same or similar medical question(s). Therefore, developing techniques to merge results from clinical trials based on information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstracts</b> is useful and important. In reality information in an abstract can either provide sufficient details about a normal distribution or just partial information about a distribution. In this paper, we first propose approaches to constructing normal distributions from both complete and incomplete statistical information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstracts.</b> We then provide methods to merge these normal distributions (or sampling distributions). Following this, we investigate the conditions under which two normal distributions can be merged. Finally, we design an algorithm to sequence the merging of trials results to ensure that the most reliable trials are considered first...|$|R

25|$|Femme au miroir (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or Lady at her Dressing Table, is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstract,</b> controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E

25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the New York School as a painter and critic who greatly {{influenced}} Pollock and Greenberg due to the rise of the feminism. Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock. Since Pollock is such a large figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstract</b> expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity. This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1965. This exhibition was more well received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.|$|E
25|$|The other Abstract expressionists {{followed}} Pollock's breakthrough {{with new}} breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Richard Pousette-Dart, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos, and others opened the floodgates to {{the diversity and}} scope of all the art that followed them. The new art movements of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism {{and in particular the}} innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, Conceptual art, and the feminist art movement {{can be traced to the}} innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and Catherine de Zegher critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the Charles Egan Gallery, the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Betty Parsons Gallery, the Kootz Gallery, the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, the Stable Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the Tenth Street galleries exhibited many emerging younger artists working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstract</b> expressionist vein.|$|E
25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>abstract</b> of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

Had the railroad been negligent towards Palsgraf, it might have been liable, but [...] "the consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong", and there was no legal wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf. Thus, the lower courts were incorrect, and must be reversed, and the case dismissed, with Palsgraf to bear the costs of suit.|$|E
