50|$|Insect pheromones have {{successfully}} been implemented {{to reduce the}} amount of damage Adelphocoris lineolatus cause to numerous agricultural crops. Sexually mature A. lineolatus produce a mixture of two pheromones known as, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate (E2HB) and (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal (4-OHE). These pheromones are responsible for high reproductive rates amongst the alfalfa plant bug. To reduce reproductivity between female and male Adelphocoris lineolatus, an excessive amount of <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (HB) needs to be added to the mixture of E2HB and 4-OHE. The addition of HB reduces the attraction between female and male A. lineolatus. <b>Hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> is responsible for stopping the release of sex pheromones from female alfalfa plant bugs, which disrupts communication between the two sexes, and reduces reproductive success in this particular species.|$|E

40|$|The European {{tarnished}} plant bug, Lygus rugulipennis, is {{an important}} pest of agricultural and horticultural crops throughout Europe. Adult male L. rugulipennis were previously shown to be attracted to traps baited with live virgin females, which suggests the females produce a sex pheromone. Volatiles produced by virgin female L. rugulipennis were shown to contain three components, <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate, and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal which elicited electroantennographic (EAG) responses from males in analyses by linked gas chromatography–electroantennography (GC-EAG). They were produced in 1. 5 : 1 : 0. 08 ratio, respectively, by single females. Collections from 1, 2, or 4 virgin females showed the proportions of <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal to increase relative to that of (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate with increasing number of females. Although these compounds were found in body extracts of {{both male and female}} L. rugulipennis, they were not detected in volatiles released by virgin males. EAG dose–response studies showed that both males and females responded to these chemicals with minimal differences in sensitivity between the sexes or to the three components, except that males were more responsive than females to (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal at the two highest doses tested. Release rates of the compounds from rubber septa, polyethylene vials, and polyethylene sachets were measured under laboratory conditions. Four field tests were carried out using sticky traps baited with all possible binary and tertiary combinations of the three chemicals using different combinations of dispensing systems. Catches of male L. rugulipennis in baited traps were similar to those in unbaited traps. Significantly fewer females were caught on traps baited with blends containing <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> than on traps without <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> or unbaited traps in one test and overall. The roles of the three compounds and possible reasons for their failure to attract males are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of volatiles by 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits {{are highly}} diminshed {{after a long}} term controlled atmosphere (CA) or ultra low oxygen (ULO) storage. To study the mechanisms of volatile production at both harvest time and after long term storage and to explain {{the reasons for the}} inability of fruits to produce adequate amounts of volatiles, aroma precursors were supplied to the fruits at different times during storage. Fruits were supplied with the following aroma precursors: Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol and isopentanol), acids (acetic-, propionic-, butyric-, pentanoic- and hexanoic acid) and esters (methyl heptanoate and methyl linolenate). Each aroma precursor was applied separately both at harvest time (October) and in March, after the apples were stored in ultra low oxygen conditions (1 % O 2 : 3 % CO 2) for 5 months. Alcohols, except ethanol, induced in both application times a strong increase in the biosynthesis of its volatiles. Butanol enhanced the production of butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, butanol and pentyl butyrate. Hexanol enhanced the synthesis of butyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>hexyl</b> acetate, hexyl propionate, hexanol and hexyl hexanoate. The biosynthesis of butyl butirate or propyl acetate by fruits stored for 5 months in ULO-storage after the treatments with hexanol or pentanol is evidence for an active beta-oxiodation process. The influence of acids was negligible at harvest time but they, except acetic and hexanioc acids, induced at the second date the biosynthesis of their esters. It is proposed that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids (linol- and linolenic acids) are the ultimate precursors for aroma (Bartley et al., 1985). The content of both fatty acids were found to be highly and positively correlated with volatile production. They decreased strongly after 6 months in ULO-storage in about the same manner as aroma production...|$|R

40|$|Mate {{location}} in many mirid bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) is mediated by female-released sex pheromones. To elucidate the potential {{role of the}} pheromones in prezygotic reproductive isolation between sympatric species, we investigated differences in the pheromone systems of five mirid species, Apolygus lucorum, Apolygus spinolae, Orthops campestris, Stenotus rubrovittatus and Taylorilygus apicalis. GC/MS analyses of metathoracic scent gland extracts of virgin females showed that all five species produced mixtures of <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal, but in quite different ratios. (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate was the major component of A. spinolae, while <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> was the most abundant component in the pheromone blends of the other four species. In addition to the three compounds, a fourth component, (E) - 2 -octenyl butyrate, was present in the gland extracts of A. lucorum and T. apicalis females. Field tests suggest that the ternary blends of <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal as found in the extracts of the females of each species do not inhibit attraction of conspecific males but ensure species-specificity of attraction between A. lucorum, O. campestris and T. apicalis. Furthermore, (E) - 2 -octenyl butyrate was essential for attraction of A. lucorum and T. apicalis males, but strongly inhibited attraction of male A. spinolae, O. campestris and S. rubrovittatus. The combined {{results from this study}} and previous studies suggest that the minor component and pheromone dose in addition to the relative ratio of the major components {{play an important role in}} reproductive isolation between mirid species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Both sexes {{of adult}} western {{tarnished}} plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae), released three volatile chemicals in relatively large amounts when attacked by ants (Pogonomyrmex rugosus and Solenopsis xyloni) or when grabbed by forceps, {{as determined by}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography– mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The relative amounts of the volatile compounds, <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal, and (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate, absorbed by SPME {{as a percentage of}} the largest were 100 %, 44 %, and 4 %, respectively, from females, and 83 %, 37 %, and 3 % from males. Both ant species were repelled by the defensive discharges (confirmed by SPME) when the ants attacked L. hesperus adults. Sexually mature L. hesperus were individually extracted in pentane to quantify the mean amounts of <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (14. 9 μg/female; 10. 3 μg/male), (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal (2. 7 μg/female; 3. 1 μg/ male), and (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate (1. 2 μg/female; 0. 6 μg/male). (E) - 4 -Oxo- 2 -hexenal was unstable in solvent when in contact with a macerated adult, but relatively stable when the solution was decanted within minutes. The production of the three major volatile components began soon after the emergence of the adult and amounts increased for about 5 – 10 d with little or no increase thereafter. Minor additional constituents were crosscorrelated in many cases with the three major ones. A cost of defensive secretion is suggested for females but not for males, because heavier females produced more volatile compounds than lighter females.

The task produced psychometric functions for chemesthetic detection unconfounded by olfactory sensations. The functions indicated a sharp transition from no detection to perfect detection, rather uniform across the esters, which themselves varied in potency by two log units. The {{correlation between the}} thresholds for the eight materials that yielded thresholds and predictions from a published linear free energy relationship (LFER) equaled 0. 99.

40|$|Mirid bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) are {{important}} pests of many crops worldwide.

We studied the volatiles released by females of four species: Lygus rugulipennis, Lygus pratensis, Lygocoris pabulinus, and Liocoris tripustulatus. Analyses of volatiles from individual, undisturbed insects showed that the three compounds were produced in species-specific blends, by females only, or in greater quantities by females than by males. The three compounds were loaded into pipette tips, which released the defined blends over at least 30 days. Traps baited with the blend for L. rugulipennis caught more males than traps baited with virgin females, with all three compounds required for maximum attractiveness. Traps baited with the specific blends {{for each of the four}} species caught males of three of the species, indicating considerable cross-attraction.

40|$|Introduction: Atherothrombotic {{diseases}} such as myocardial or cerebral infarction are serious consequences of the thrombus formation in blood vessels. Thrombolytic agents are used to dissolve the already formed clots in the blood vessels. However, these drugs have certain adverse effects, which cause serious and sometimes fatal consequences. Methods: Plants essential oils were prepared and analyzed by GC/MS. To evaluate the fibrinolytic effect, fibrinogen labeled with FITC {{was added to the}} plasma. Ca 2 + was used for production of labeled clot. The essential oil (1 / 10, 1 / 100, 1 / 1000 dilutions) with and without streptokinase as a positive control, were added. Fluorescence was determined after 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes (excitation = 478, emission = 510). Results: Our findings showed that carvacrol was the main component of Zataria multiflora essential oil. This essential oil showed the best fibrinolytic activity. Curcuma domestica also showed fibrinolytic activity, which might be related to the presence of curcumene, zingiberene and tumeron. The main component of Cinnamomum verum essential oil was cinnamaldehyde and fibrinolytic activity of this essential oil was lower than Zataria multiflora and Curcuma domestica [...] The essential oil from Heracleum persicum with main components such as <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and liner esters did not have any significant fibrinolytic activity.

At first essentials oil and various extracts of two plants including petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol, ether and aqueous were provided. Then, different concentrations of them were prepared. These fractions were evaluated for toxicity using Brine Shrimp Lethality assay (BSL). Each of fractions was assessed by two methods of disk and solution. Survivors were counted after 24 h. These data were processed in Probit-analysis program to estimate LC 50 values (the concentration at which 50 % lethality was observed) with 95 % confidence intervals for statistically significant comparisons of potencies. In disc method, methanol extract of Z. officinale (LC 50 = 28. 3134 µg/ml) showed the most activity in comparison with positive standard of potassium dichromate (LC 50 = 23. 2893 µg/ml); but in solution method, essential oil of H. persicum (LC 50 = 0. 0071 µl/ml) was the most active fraction in comparison with potassium dichromate (LC 50 = 27. 7528 µg/ml).

40|$|All aphid species studied so far {{share the}} same sex {{pheromone}} components, nepetalactol and nepetalactone. Variation by different enantiomers and blends of the two components released by different aphid species are limited and can only partially explain species-specific attraction of males to females. While some host-plant odours are known to enhance specific attraction of aphid species, herbivore-induced plant volatiles that synergise attractiveness to the sex pheromone are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that for the host-alternating rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini)) specificity of attraction of males to females is triggered by female-induced tree odours in combination with a 1 : 8 ratio of (4 aS, 7 S, 7 aR) -nepetalactone and (1 R, 4 aS, 7 S, 7 aR) -nepetalactol.

40|$|Multicellular {{electrophysiological}} {{responses from}} the dorsal organ on the cephalic lobes of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae (wild-type Canton S) stimulated with a cold-trapped banana volatile extract showed that this structure has an olfactory function in the fruit fly. Responses of the dorsal organ were also recorded to constituents of the banana volatile extract as they eluted from a gas chromatographic column (GC-coupled dorsal organ electrophysiology). The active chemostimulants were identified as 2 -heptanone, isoamyl alcohol, hexyl acetate, hexanol and <b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Applying the same recording system to the terminal organ sensilla, no responses were obtained to either the banana volatile bouquet or its constituents. By contrast, high frequency multicellular responses were recorded in response to touching the terminal organ with the gustatory stimuli KCl and grapefruit juice; responses were absent on similar stimulation of the dorsal organ with either NaCl or KCl. This suggests a role for olfaction by the dorsal organ and for gustation by the terminal organ in Drosophila larvae. In a 7 -mm high wind tunnel with a thin 1. 2 % agar floor, the Drosophila larvae showed odour-conditioned upwind responses in an air stream of 0. 1 m/s bearing banana volatiles. Drosophila larvae responded best to the odour of cut bananas. A 1 : 1 mixture of the banana odour constituents 2 -heptanone and hexanol (at either 50 or 100 μg source dose each) proved as attractive as the known larval attractants propionic acid and isoamyl acetate on their own at 100 μg, whereas hexanol and 2 -heptanone on their own at a 100 μg source dose were less attractive.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to develop new approaches to monitoring and managing Tarnished Plant Bug (TPB), an important pest of strawberries and many other crops, through an improved understanding of its use of semiochemicals to find mates and host plants. We proposed to 1) Evaluate potential components of the TPB sex pheromone under realistic field conditions and 2) Initiate a study to identify attractive volatile compounds from a highly preferred weed host and test with virgin females and potential components of sex pheromone. We used funnel traps baited with either live, virgin females or different combinations of putative pheromone components and/or extracts of volatiles collected from Erigeron annuus or extracts from virgin females confined to traps in the field to test for attractiveness under field conditions. We also assessed antagonistic properties of putative pheromone components by placing single compounds beneath traps baited with virgin females. In addition, we attempted to test the relative role of visual and plant volatiles in host colonization. A total of 11 field experiments were conducted during the season using funnel traps, starting on 19 June and continuing until 3 September. Putative pheromone compounds in various combinations over this time period captured 5 male TPB while virgin females captured over 100 males. When placed beneath a trap baited with a live virgin female, 4 -oxo-E-(2) -hexenal or its derivative appeared to enhance captures, while the other principal components (<b>hexyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and E- 2 -hexenyl butyrate) appeared to be antagonistic. An extract from the volatiles of flowering E. annuus alone or when added to the derivative of 4 -oxo-E-(2) -hexenal did not result in any captures of TPB in live traps. When the plant extract was added with a virgin female we captured 4 males compared to 16 in traps baited with only the female. In late summer we used a battery, pump and filters to collect volatiles produced by virgin female TPB in the field. When placed in a live trap, the extracts from TPB captured 3 males while live virgin females captured 65 males. We conducted a choice test where we presented a group of TPB to chrysanthemum, a host plant of TPB, with or without its yellow flowers and with or without yellow cards or volatile extract from the flowers. Most TPB flew to top of the screen house and made no choice.
