A single ip injection (in inducible fetal lung supernatants) of 100 mg/kg of 3-MC to the mothers resulted in a maximal 50-fold induction of AHH activity by 8 hr, which persisted for 48 hr.

The measurement technique only requires a single point velocity measurement in the secondary air inflow and a static pressure measurement in the primary air chamber. The design if the device allows the <b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> to be determined for different primary air nozzle arrangements with different geometries for combined air discharge outlets. Experimentally measured data is compared with theoretical values. Four different sized circular nozzles with different outlet geometries were used to supply primary air into the device. The outlet geometries consisted of circular, slot and a rectangular shape.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida KT 2442 is a root-colonizing strain {{which can}} use proline, {{one of the}} major {{components}} in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn 5 –Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn 5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1, 315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to ′lacZ.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the use of the}} E. coli lac operator-repressor system to regulate the expression of genes introduced into mammalian cells by gene transfer. We find that the bacterial lac repressor protein encoded in a suitable expression vector is synthesized in mammalian cells in culture, assembles into a tetramer, enters the nucleus to some extent, and represses expression of another gene that has one or several lac operator sequences inserted into any one of several sites in the promoter region of the gene. Derepression can be achieved by exposure of the cells to IPTG. From a practical point of view of an inducible genetic switch, this system confers an induction level of somewhere between 10 - and 20 -fold in most of the cases we have tested. That is not better than those that have been achieved with heat shock, mouse mammary tumor virus, and metallothionein promoters. There may, however, be some situations and some promoters for which the use of the lac operator system is advantageous. We have also shown that this lac control system can be used to regulate the expression of genes introduced into Xenopus oocytes by micro-injection. At present, we have been trying to revise this system by using a newly developed promoter containing a symmetric lac operator sequence inserted at the various strategic points within the human metallothionein II_A promoter and enhancer regions, which consist of several positive control elements, in order to achieve <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> of a factor of 100 or more. We have also generated a new lacI gene which encodes a repressor containing at its carboxyl terminus the nuclear localization signal of the SV 40 large-T antigen. Overall, by combining the newly developed lac control promoters with the new repressor producing cell lines, we hope to generate an inducible expression system with large <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> that {{can be used as a}} general genetic switch in the future.

Controlling gene overexpression becomes a critical issue when protein production is desired. In addition to several aspects regarding toxicity or plasmid instability, tight control of gene expression is an essential factor in biotechnological processes. Thus, the search for better-controlled circuits is an important issue among biotechnologists. Traditionally, expression systems involve a single regulatory protein operating over a target promoter. However, these circuits are limited on their <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> (e. g., by their restriction in the maximal expression capacity, by their leakiness under non-induced conditions).

In an effort to simplify the methods employed in identifying the different staphylococcal beta-lactamases, we evaluated whether distinctive substrate profiles could be obtained by using whole-cell suspensions of 115 beta-lactamase-producing isolates of S. aureus.

40|$|The PHR 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the {{apoenzyme}} for the DNA {{repair enzyme}} photolyase. PHR 1 transcription is induced {{in response to}} 254 nm radiation {{and a variety of}} chemical damaging agents. We report here the identification of promoter elements required for PHR 1 expression. Transcription is regulated primarily through three sequence elements clustered within a 120 bp region immediately upstream of the translational start site. A 20 bp interrupted palindrome comprises UASPHR 1 and is responsible for 80 - 90 % of basal and induced expression. UASPHR 1 alone can activate transcription of a CYC 1 minimal promoter but does not confer damage responsiveness. In the intact PHR 1 promoter UAS function is dependent upon an upstream essential sequence (UES). URSPHR 1 contains a binding site for the damage-responsive repressor Prp; consistent with this role, deletion or specific mutations of the URS increase basal level expression and decrease the <b>induction</b> <b>ratio.</b> Deletion of URSPHR 1 also eliminates the requirement for UESPHR 1 for promoter activation, indicating that the UES attenuates Prp-mediated repression.

40|$|The {{harlequin}} ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis {{has emerged}} as a model species in invasion biology because of its strong resistance against pathogens and remarkable capacity to outcompete native ladybirds. The invasive success of the species may reflect its well-adapted immune system, a hypothesis we tested by analysing the transcriptome and characterizing the immune gene repertoire of untreated beetles and those challenged with bacteria and fungi. We found that most H. axyridis immunity-related genes were similar in diversity to their counterparts in the reference beetle Tribolium castaneum, but there was an unprecedented expansion among genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs). We identified more than 50 putative AMPs belonging to seven different gene families, and many of the corresponding genes were shown by quantitative real-time RT–PCR to be induced in the immune-stimulated beetles. AMPs with the highest <b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> in the challenged beetles were shown to demonstrate broad and potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and entomopathogenic fungi.

Methods: The relationship between the molecular response to IFNb and treatment response was determined in 85 patients using a longitudinal design in which treatment effect was categorized by brain magnetic resonance imaging as good (n = 70) or poor response (n = 15). Molecular response was quantified using a customized cDNA macroarray assay for 166 IFN-regulated genes (IRGs). Results: The molecular response to IFNb differed significantly between patients in the pattern and number of regulated genes. The molecular response was strikingly stable for individuals for as long as 24 months, however, suggesting an individual ‘IFN response fingerprint’.

Nineteen polypeptides had levels highest during aerobic growth. These proteins include the enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, several tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, superoxide dismutase, and tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate transmethylase. The other aerobiosis-induced proteins have not been identified.

However, the precise targeting of a particular cell type {{at a given time}} point has remained challenging since spatial specificity has so far depended exclusively on the promoter driving Cre recombinase expression. We have recently established split-Cre that allows DNA recombination to be controlled by coincidental activity of two promoters, thereby increasing spatial specificity of Cre-mediated DNA recombination. To allow temporal control of split-Cre-mediated DNA recombination we have now extended split-Cre by fusing split-Cre proteins with the tamoxifen inducible ERT 2 domain derived from CreERT 2. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the split-CreERT 2 system, Cre-mediated DNA recombination is controlled by two expression cassettes as well as the time of tamoxifen application. By using two independent Cre-dependent reporters in cultured cells, the combination of NCre-ERT 2 +ERT 2 -CCre was identified as having the most favorable properties of all constructs tested, showing an <b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> of about 10 and EC 50 -values for 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen of 10 nM to 70 nM.

Cell morphology was observed using inverted microscopy, and cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using the MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The activities of NF-κB were analyzed by western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Cell growth was significantly inhibited by As 2 O 3, oxaliplatin and paclitaxel in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (P< 0. 05), while 5 FU inhibited cell growth in a time-dependent manner only (P< 0. 05). The growth inhibition rate and apoptosis <b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> were increased following the combined treatment of the chemotherapy agent and NF-κB inhibitor. The expression of NF-κB p 65 was upregulated when cells were treated with a chemotherapy drug, however it was downregulated following combined treatment or treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor alone. In conclusion, an NF-κB inhibitor combined with a chemotherapy drug effectively inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and inhibited NF-κB activity to enhance the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of HT- 29 cells...|$|E

The method had low precision compared with conventional specific-activity-based induction assays, which are impracticable for inhibitors. Accordingly, induction was only considered to be significant if <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> > 10 were found at two consecutive time intervals, with ‘strong induction’ if one or more of these ratios was > 100.

At the other extreme, relebactam caused no significant induction for any strain. Avibactam gave strain-variable results, with strong concentration-dependent induction for 2 / 5 E. cloacae and 2 / 5 P. aeruginosa, but little or no induction for the other strains, including all the C. freundii strains.

Bacteria representing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Propionibacterium and Streptococcus species induced anti-inflammatory IL- 10 production, although quantitative differences between the bacteria were observed. S. thermophilus was able to induce IL- 12 production, while the production of IL- 12 induced by other bacteria remained at a low level. The highest anti-inflammatory potential was seen with bifidobacteria, as evidenced by high IL- 10 /IL- 12 <b>induction</b> <b>ratios.</b> All studied non-pathogenic bacteria were able to stimulate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3 that controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes.

A framework is outlined for the application of a mode of action test battery for these assessments. Passive air samplers which may be deployed over wide spatial scales simultaneously are particularly suited as a screening tool for assessing exposure.

The hya operon encodes hydrogenase 1, and the cbdAB-appA operon encodes cytochrome bd-II oxidase and acid phosphatase, pH 2. 5. Both operons are targets for the transcriptional activator AppY. In exponential growth, expression of the hya and cbd operons was reduced in an rpoS mutant lacking the RNA polymerase sigmaS factor, and the induction of the two operons by entry into stationary phase in rich medium was strongly dependent on sigmaS. Both operons were induced by carbon starvation, but only induction of the hya operon was dependent on sigmaS, whereas that of the cbd promoter was dependent on AppY. The appY gene also showed sigmaS-dependent induction by carbon starvation. The cbd and hya operons were also found to exhibit a sigmaS-dependent transient twofold induction by osmotic upshift. Like the cbd operon, the hya operon was highly induced by phosphate starvation. For both operons the induction was strongly dependent on AppY. The <b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> of the two operons was the same in rpoS+ and rpoS mutant strains, indicating that the phosphate starvation-induced increase in sigmaS concentration {{is not involved in}} the phosphate regulation of these operons...|$|E
40|$|The SoxR protein of Escherichia coli {{responds}} to redox signals by activating the transcription of soxS, which encodes another transcription activator that directly stimulates oxidative stress genes. We show here that transcription of the soxR gene, which is positioned head-to-head with soxS in the chromosome, initiates in the intergenic region and is itself repressed by SoxR protein in {{in vitro transcription}} experiments. Analysis of single-copy operon fusions to soxR, combined {{with the results of}} Northern blotting experiments, verified this regulation and the transcription start site in vivo. The structure of the overlapping promoters is such that the single SoxR-binding site is located in the - 10 /- 35 spacer of the soxS promoter, but just downstream of the - 10 element of the soxR promoter. Activated and non-activated SoxR bind this site equally well, exerting nearly constant repression of soxR; activated SoxR simultaneously stimulates the soxS promoter >/= 30 -fold. The functional soxR promoter depresses soxS transcription when SoxR is not activated and enhances soxS transcription when SoxR is activated, as shown by comparing the expression of soxS'::lacZ fusions with and without the soxR - 35 element (<b>induction</b> <b>ratio</b> only approximately 7 -fold). SoxR thus represents a highly polar, redox-regulated transcriptional switch that maximizes the change in expression of soxS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Molecular switch {{systems that}} {{activate}} gene expression {{by a small}} molecule are effective technologies that are widely used in applied biological research. Nuclear receptors are valuable candidates for these regulation systems due to their functional role as ligand activated transcription factors. Previously, our group engineered {{a variant of the}} retinoid × receptor to be responsive to the synthetic compound, LG 335, but not responsive to its natural ligand, 9 - cis -retinoic acid. Results This work focuses on characterizing a molecular switch system that quantitatively controls transgene expression. This system is composed of an orthogonal ligand/nuclear receptor pair, LG 335 and GRQCIMFI, along with an artificial promoter controlling expression of a target transgene. GRQCIMFI is composed of the fusion of the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, Gal 4, and a retinoid × receptor variant. The variant consists of the following mutations: Q 275 C, I 310 M, and F 313 I in the ligand binding domain. When introduced into mammalian cell culture, the switch shows luciferase activity at concentrations as low as 100 nM of LG 335 with a 6. 3 ± 1. 7 -fold <b>induction</b> <b>ratio.</b> The developed one-component system activates transgene expression when introduced transiently or virally. Conclusions We have successfully shown that this system can induce tightly controlled transgene expression and can be used for transient transfections or retroviral transductions in mammalian cell culture. Further characterization is needed for gene therapy applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between the biologically effective dose (BED) of a phage T 7 biological dosimeter and the induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and (6 - 4) photoproducts ((6 - 4) PD) in the phage DNA was determined using seven various UV sources. The BED is the inactivation rate of phage T 7 expressed in HT 7 units. The CPD and (6 - 4) PD were determined by lesion-specific monoclonal antibodies in an immunodot-blot assay. The various lamps induced these lesions at different rates; the relative <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> of CPD to (6 - 4) PD increased with increasing effective wavelength of irradiation source. The amount of total adducts per phage was compared to the BED of phage T 7 dosimeter, representing {{the average number of}} UV lesions in phage. For UVC (200 - 280 nm radiation) and unfiltered TL 01 the number of total adducts approximates the reading; however, UV sources having longer effective wavelengths produced fewer CPD and (6 - 4) PD. A possible explanation is that although the most relevant lesions by UVC are the CPD and (6 - 4) PD, at longer wavelengths other photoproducts can contribute to the lethal damage of phages. The results emphasize the need to study the biological effects of solar radiation because the lesions responsible for the lethal effect may be different from those produced by various UV sources...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} {{five members of the}} neurotrophins family in ovarian endometriotic cyst (endometrioma) (OMA), compared to eutopic endometrium (EE) and to examine the correlation between the levels of induction and the pain intensity. Patients and methods: Twelve Caucasian women in luteal phase, operated for painful stage IV endometriosis were assigned to 2 groups according to a total Visual Analog Scale (tVAS) score above 15 or below 10. tVAS takes into account all VAS scores for dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, non cyclic chronic pelvic pain, gastrointestinal and lower urinary symptoms. Samples of OMA and EE were processed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for NGF, BDNF, NT- 3, NT- 4 / 5 and NTRK 2 mRNA expression. Expression levels in OMA were compared to those in EE on one hand and between two groups of 6 mild painful and 6 highly painful patients on the other. Results: All neurotrophins were significantly higher expressed in OMA than in EE, in particular NGF and BDNF (induction ratios: 20. 6 and 9. 7, respectively). In contrast, no correlation was observed between <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> and pain intensity. Conclusion and discussion: This is the first study reporting an over-expression of all neurotrophins in endometriosis, as only NGF was previously documented. It confirms the central role of this family in the genesis and modulation of pain in endometriosis. Anti-neurotrophin selective therapy might be a promising way of analgesia in the future. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Small molecule-regulated {{transcription}} has broad {{utility and}} {{would benefit from}} an easily delivered self-contained regulatory cassette capable of robust, tightly controlled target gene expression. We describe the delivery of a modified dimerizer-regulated gene expression system to cells on a single retrovirus. A transcription factor cassette responsive to the natural product dimerizer rapamycin was optimized for retroviral delivery by fusing a highly potent chimeric activation domain to the rapamycin-binding domain of FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP). This improvement led {{to an increase in}} both the potency and maximal levels of gene expression induced by rapamycin, or nonimmunosuppressive rapamycin analogs. The modified transcription factor cassette was incorporated along with a target gene into a single rapamycin-responsive retrovirus. Cell pools stably transduced with the single virus system displayed negligible basal expression and gave <b>induction</b> <b>ratios</b> of at least three orders of magnitude in the presence of rapamycin or a nonimmunosuppressive rapamycin analog. Levels of induced gene expression were comparable to those obtained with the constitutive retroviral long terminal repeat and the single virus system performed well in four different mammalian cell lines. Regulation with the dimerizer-responsive retrovirus was tight enough to allow the generation of cell lines displaying inducible expression of the highly toxic diphtheria toxin A chain gene. The ability to deliver the tightly inducible rapamycin system in a single retrovirus should facilitate its use in the study of gene function in a broad range of cell types...|$|R
