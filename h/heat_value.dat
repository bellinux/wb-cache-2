2500|$|Methylacetylene-propadiene (MAPP) gas and LPG gas {{are similar}} fuels, because LPG gas is {{liquefied}} petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a <b>heat</b> <b>value</b> {{a little less than}} acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures— above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume oxy-fuel cutting torches which can cut up to [...] steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe shipping and handling. MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications in particular, rather than welding applications.|$|E
40|$|Definitions for <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of a biomass The <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of any fuel is {{the energy}} {{released}} per unit mass or per unit {{volume of the}} fuel when the fuel is completely burned (ANSI/ASABE S 593. 1 2011). The term calorific value is synonymous to the <b>heating</b> <b>value.</b> Typical units for expressing calorific or <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> are MJ/kg in SI units or Btu/lb in English units. The <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of a fuel depends on the assumption made {{on the condition of}} water molecules in the final combustion products. The higher <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (HHV) refers to a condition in which the water is condensed out of the combustion products. Because of this condensation all of the <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of the fuel including sensible heat and latent heat are accounted for. The lower <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (LHV), on the other hand refers to the condition in which water in the final combustion products remains as vapor (or steam); i. e. the steam is not condensed into liquid water and thus the latent heat is not accounted for. The term net <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (NHV) refers to LHV (ANSI/ASABE S 593. 1 2011). The term gross <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (GHV) refers to HHV. Determination of <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> of a biomass <b>Heating</b> <b>value</b> of a biomass is measured experimentally in terms of the high <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (HHV). The standard method uses a device called bomb calorimeter. The device burns a small mass of biomass in the presence of oxygen inside a sealed container (or bomb). The heat released from combustion is transferred to a mass of fluid (air or water) that surrounds the container. The <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> is calculated from the product of mass of fluid x specific heat of fluid x net temperature increase. The calculated <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> must be corrected for heat losses to the mass of container, heat conduction through the container wall, and heat losses to the surrounding of the device. In modern calorimeters the corrections are made automatically using sensors and controllers. The resulting measured <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> is considered gross <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> (high <b>heating</b> <b>value)</b> at constant volume because the biomass combustion in the container has taken place inside the fixed volume of the container. The resulting gross <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> can be expressed based on dry mass content of the sample biomass...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{explored}} the factors influencing <b>heating</b> <b>value</b> {{in the process}} of torrefaction of water hyacinth. Methods: Torrefaction was applied with three temperature settings (200, 300, 400 oC) and three time settings (1, 2, 3 h) using small electric heaters (11. 3 ℓ of holding volume). This study investigated the <b>heating</b> <b>values</b> with the washing process and process factors influenced the torrefaction.
