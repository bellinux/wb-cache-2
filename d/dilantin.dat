50|$|Anticonvulsants are {{the most}} {{successful}} medication in reducing and preventing seizures from reoccurring. The goal of these medications {{in being able to}} reduce the reoccurrence of seizures {{is to be able to}} limit the amount of rapid and extensive firing of neurons so that a focal region of neurons cannot become over-activated thereby initiating a seizure. Although anticonvulsants are able to reduce the amount of seizures that occur in the brain, no medication has been discovered to date that is able to prevent the development of epilepsy following a head injury. There are a wide range of anticonvulsants that have both different modes of action and different abilities in preventing certain types of seizures. Some of the anticonvulsants that are prescribed to patients today include: Carbamazepine (Tegretol), Phenytoin (<b>Dilantin</b> Kapseals), Gabapentin (Neurontin), Levetiracetam (Keppra), Lamotrigine (Lamictal), Topiramate (Topamax), Tiagabine (Gabitril), Zonisamide (Zonegran) and Pregabalin (Lyrica).|$|E

40|$|Embryonic {{exposure}} to the anticonvulsant drug <b>Dilantin</b> {{has been shown to}} have detrimental effects on development. Some of the observed effects include growth retardation, craniofacial defects, and even death. As the drug is metabolized, toxic intermediates form, which could be causing the characteristic abnormalities observed in embryos exposed to <b>Dilantin.</b> Culture of preimplantation mouse embryos in the presence of IOµg/mL or 20 µglmL <b>Dilantin</b> show a slowing of development inl 9. 3 % and 19. 1 % ofembryos respectively at Day 3 of culture. The toxic intermediates could be causing alterations in cyclin expression, cell cycle proteins, or the cell cycle timing itself. Previous research determined an in vivo baseline expression for cyclins B 1, E, D, A and cdk 2, which was used to compare the expression of these cyclins and cdks between in vivo and <b>Dilantin</b> cultured embryos. Altered patterns in cultured embryos suggested that an alteration in cell cycle timing, therefore, S phase timing was determined in cultured untreated embryos utilizing 5 '-Bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results of the experiment showed the second S phase was at 30 hpf, approximately 9 hours later, and the third S phase was at 54 hpf, approximately 3 hours later than previous in vivo literature reports. S phase timing in NaOH vehicle controls did not appear different from untreated controls. <b>Dilantin</b> showed S phase peaks at 24 and 55 hpf. In the <b>Dilantin</b> treated embryos, the nuclear staining intensity for the second S phase did not decrease as rapidly as had been observed in control embryos. Embryos that developed beyond the 2 -cell stage demonstrated two distinct S phase peaks at 45 and 54 hpf, while embryos at the 2 -cell stage did pass through the second S phase but not the third S phase. These data suggested that the <b>Dilantin</b> could be causing a delay in G 2. Future experiments would be necessary to determine if the expression of G 2 cyclins are being altered in <b>Dilantin</b> treated embryos. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dilantin,</b> {{diphenylhydantoin}} (DPH), is an {{anticonvulsant drug}} {{used to control}} the disorder known as epilepsy. <b>Dilantin,</b> however, is a known human teratogen and pregnant females taking this drug have {{an increased risk of}} spontaneous miscarriages and of giving birth to babies with fetal hydantoin syndrome. To study the effects of <b>Dilantin</b> at preimplantation stages, varying concentrations of the drug were added directly to cultures of 2 -cell mouse embryos. After two days of culture, the embryos were analyzed for percent development beyond the two cell stage. Although effects of <b>Dilantin</b> were observed, no true dosage response curve was found in the therapeutic range in the cultures where <b>Dilantin</b> was added directly. Cultures containing 5 pg/ml DPH promoted normal development to morula and blastocyst stages (46 %). DPH at 10 and 20 gg/ml concentrations promoted development to the 4 - 8 cell stage but morula and blastocyst stages were reduced (40. 5 % and 53 %). This effect became more severe at 50 and 100 µg/ml levels. Further studies that investigate whether the teratogenic agent is the parent drug or actually a metabolic intermediate of DPH were performed by addition of a microsomal S 9 fraction to cultures of two cell mouse embryos. The S 9 fraction alone was found to not be teratogenic to the embryos itself, however, the addition of DPH and S 9 fraction increased the toxic effect of the drug. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
40|$|Although diphenyihydantoin (<b>Dilantin)</b> {{has been}} used for the {{treatment}} of epilepsy since 1937, comparatively little is known concerning the fate and the excretion of this and other clinically useful 5 -substituted hydantoins in animals or man.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Discrete focal lesions in the {{splenium}} of {{the corpus}} cal-losum on MR images in epileptic patients have received little {{attention in the}} literature. Our purpose was to describe these lesions, which {{may be related to}} the toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and to discuss the possible mechanisms of their development. METHODS: We examined six patients with epilepsy whose brain MR imaging findings showed a discrete focal nonhemorrhagic lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The medical records and MR images were reviewed retrospectively with respect to the patients’ clinical history, medication, and laboratory findings to determine the etiology of the lesion. RESULTS: In all six patients MR imaging showed a focal lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which was ovoid in shape and 15 to 19 mm in size. In the three patients who received contrast material, there was no enhancement of the lesion. Four of six patients had a history of medication with <b>dilantin,</b> in two of whom the level of serum <b>dilantin</b> was found to be elevated (22. 3 mg/mL and 70. 4 mg/mL, respectively).

40|$|Cell-cycle {{progression}} in mammalian {{cells is}} coordinated {{by a series}} of control points. The D-type cyclins are a family of key cell cycle regulators that are controlled largely by mitogens and their association with and activation of cdk 4 and 6 at the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. This study seeks to first analyze cyclins D 1, D 2, and D 3 expression patterns in preimplantation mouse embryos using in vivo studies and then analyze the effects of <b>Dilantin</b> on the cyclin D 1 expression pattern in cultured embryos. Antibody staining against cyclin D 1, D 2, and D 3 via indirect immunofluorescence using a Zeiss Confocal Microscope and analysis of individual embryo staining intensities using Zeiss computer software were employed to evaluate expression patterns throughout the first three cell cycles. The data showed that all three D cyclins were present throughout the first three cell cycles. Cyclin D 1 had peak average fluorescence intensity at the G 2 phase of the second cell cycle with a decrease at the G 1 in the third cell cycle. Cyclin D 2 had a consistent increase of fluorescence intensity throughout all three cell cycles. Cyclin D 3 had peak average fluorescence intensity at the G 2 phase of the second cell cycle with an immediate decrease at the Gl phase in the third cell cycle. Cyclin D 1 was localized to the nucleus in G 1 phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, cyclin D 2 was found in the nucleus during G 2 phases of the cell cycle rather than in G 1. Cyclin D 3 was not localized to the nucleus in either cell cycle phase throughout the first three cell cycles. These unique nuclear staining patterns seen by D 1, D 2, and D 3 may reflect a function in the cell cycle. Embryos cultured in the presence of l 0 gg/ml of <b>Dilantin</b> were found to be slowed in development indicated by the absence of transition from the one-cell to the two-cell stage when compared to the controls. Since the <b>Dilantin</b> cultured embryos never reached G 1 of the second cell cycle the increase in fluorescence intensity seen was still considered to be a representation of the G 2 phase of the first cell cycle. Cyclin Dl's fluorescence intensity was affected by <b>Dilantin</b> and accompanied with unstained nuclei during the G 2 phase of the first cell cycle. The peak average fluorescence intensity occurred during the G 1 phase of the second cell cycle for cyclin D 1 stained CZB control, while the vehicle control, 0. 001 N NaOH, remained constant. Both CZB and 0. 001 N NaOH had similar expression patterns seen previously in the cyclin D 1 in vivo data. The information gained from the in vivo and in vitro experiments will help to better understand what causes the problems associated with exposure to <b>Dilantin,</b> and also the effects <b>Dilantin</b> has on the cell cycle.
