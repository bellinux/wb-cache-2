40|$|Non-minimally <b>coupled</b> <b>f(R)</b> {{gravity model}} is an {{interesting}} approach to explain the late time acceleration of the Universe without introducing any exotic matter component in the energy budget of the Universe. But distinguishing such model with the concordance Λ CDM model using present observational data is a serious challenge. In this paper, we address this issue using the observations related {{to the growth of}} matter over density g(z) as measured by different galaxy surveys. As background cosmology is not sufficient to distinguish different dark energy models, we first find out the functional form for f(R) (which is non-minimally coupled to the matter lagrangian) that produces the similar background cosmology as in Λ CDM. Subsequently we calculate the growth for the matter over density g(z) for such non minimally <b>coupled</b> <b>f(R)</b> models and compare them with the Λ CDM Universe. We also use the measurements of g(z) σ_ 8 (z) by different galaxy surveys to reconstruct the behavior for g(z) and σ_ 8 (z) for both the non-minimally <b>coupled</b> <b>f(R)</b> gravity models {{as well as for the}} Λ CDM. Our results show that there is a small but finite window where one can distinguish the non-minimally <b>coupled</b> <b>f(R)</b> models with the concordance Λ CDM.

40|$|We use {{properties}} of void populations identified in N-body simulations to forecast {{the ability of}} upcoming galaxy surveys to differentiate models of f(R) gravity from cosmology. We analyze multiple simulation realizations, which were designed to mimic the expected number densities, volumes, and redshifts of the upcoming Euclid satellite and a lower-redshift ground-based counterpart survey, using the public VIDE toolkit. We examine void abundances, ellipicities, radial density profiles, and radial velocity profiles at redshifts 1. 0 and 0. 43. We find that stronger <b>f(R)</b> <b>coupling</b> strengths eliminates small voids and produces voids up to ∼ 20 % larger in radius, leading to a significant tilt in the void number function. Additionally, {{under the influence of}} modified gravity, voids at all scales tend to be measurably emptier with correspondingly higher compensation walls. The velocity profiles reflect this, showing increased outflows inside voids and increased inflows outside voids. Using the void number function as an example, we forecast that future surveys can constrain the modified gravity coupling strength to ∼ 3 × 10 ^- 5 using voids.

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} use of Modal Acoustic Emission to monitor damage progression to carbon fiber/epoxy tows. There is a risk for catastrophic failure of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) due to burst-before-leak (BBL) stress rupture (SR) failure of carbon-epoxy (C/Ep) COPVs. A lack of quantitative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is causing problems in current and future spacecraft designs. It is therefore important to develop and demonstrate critical NDE that can be implemented during stages of the design process since the observed rupture can occur with little of no advanced warning. Therefore a program was required to develop quantitative acoustic emission (AE) procedures specific to C/Ep overwraps, but which also have utility for monitoring damage accumulation in composite structure in general, and {{to lay the groundwork}} for establishing critical thresholds for accumulated damage in composite structures, such as COPVs, so that precautionary or preemptive engineering steps can be implemented to minimize of obviate the risk of catastrophic failure.

40|$|AbstractUtilizing the Axiomatic Design (AD) {{principles}} {{to develop a}} perfect product, design of a manufacturing system with minimal complexity is required. For the purpose of reducing the manufacturing system complexity, theoretically, it is preferred to integrate multiple Process Variables (PVs) of the product into a single process unit. However, due to significant presence of some active noise factors, this integration practice may result in failing to maintain the independence among some of Functional Requirements (FRs) of the product. This event {{is the result of}} statistical causal relationships unintentionally developed among a subset of the integrated PVs. In such a condition, the AD's Independence Axiom cannot be successfully satisfied and reaching a system with minimal complexity is inconceivable, even though an uncoupled or decoupled system design is apparently presented. To mitigate this kind of <b>FRs</b> <b>coupling</b> generated from the PVs integration, this study proposes partial & semi-partial correlation analysis as a statistical solution to identify the most appropriate integration choices where integrating a subset of the PVs is inevitable. Furthermore, based on the Taguchi's loss function, a quantitative criterion is established to fairly compare any two non-ideal manufacturing system designs and choose the one with relatively lower loss. The proposed approach explained in this study is verified based on hypothetical data...|$|R
