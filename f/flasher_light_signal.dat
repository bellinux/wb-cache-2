When the intensity of sound exceeds certain intensity, the alarm is triggered and the siren begins to operate. The speaker beeps and the <b>flasher</b> (<b>light)</b> flashes. These actions thus alert {{the owner of the}} residence and/or security personnel of the presence of an intruder...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} highly complex sensory {{mechanisms}} {{to monitor their}} surroundings and adapt their growth and development to the prevailing environmental conditions. The integration of information from multiple environmental cues enables the coordination of development with favourable seasonal conditions and, ultimately, determines plant form. <b>Light</b> <b>signals,</b> perceived via the phytochrome, cryptochrome and phototropin photoreceptor families, are especially important environmental signals. Redundancy of function among phytochromes and their interaction with blue light photoreceptors enhance sensitivity to <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> facilitating the accurate detection of, and response to, environmental ¯uctuations. In this review, current understanding of Arabidopsis phytochrome functions will be summarized, in particular, the interactions among the phytochromes and the integration of <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> with directional and temperature sensing mechanisms. Key words: Arabidopsis, environmental cues, <b>light</b> <b>signals,</b> photoreceptors, temperature sensing mechanisms...|$|R
