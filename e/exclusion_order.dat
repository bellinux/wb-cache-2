5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{proved to}} be the most {{controversial}} of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to national pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles Horsky, although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>order</b> Korematsu had disobeyed. The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans, although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The United States Census Bureau {{assisted}} the internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on Japanese Americans. The Bureau denied its role for decades, {{but it became}} public in 2007. In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld {{the constitutionality of the}} removal by ruling against Fred Korematsu's appeal for violating an <b>exclusion</b> <b>order.</b> The Court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders, avoiding the issue of the incarceration of U.S. citizens without due process.|$|E
25|$|On December 18, 1944, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} two {{decisions}} on {{the legality of the}} incarceration under Executive Order 9066. Korematsu v. United States, a 6–3 decision upholding a Nisei's conviction for violating the military <b>exclusion</b> <b>order,</b> stated that, in general, the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast was constitutional. However, Ex parte Endo unanimously declared that loyal citizens of the United States, regardless of cultural descent, could not be detained without cause. In effect, the two rulings held that, while the eviction of U.S. citizens in the name of military necessity was legal, the subsequent incarceration was not—thus paving the way for their release.|$|E
25|$|Several {{significant}} legal decisions arose out of Japanese-American internment, {{relating to}} {{the powers of the}} government to detain citizens in wartime. Among the cases which reached the US Supreme Court were Yasui v. United States (1943), Hirabayashi v. United States (1943), ex parte Endo (1944), and Korematsu v. United States (1944). In Yasui and Hirabayashi, the court upheld the constitutionality of curfews based on Japanese ancestry; in Korematsu, the court upheld the constitutionality of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>order.</b> In Endo, the court accepted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ruled that the WRA had no authority to subject a loyal citizen to its procedures.|$|E

[...] He argued that the Executive Order 9066 was unconstitutional and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was arrested and convicted. No question was raised as to Korematsu's loyalty to the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 1942, Western Defense Command began issuing Civilian <b>Exclusion</b> <b>orders,</b> {{commanding}} that [...] "all {{persons of}} Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens" [...] report to designated assembly points.

50|$|However, {{rights to}} live in another EU/EEA state are not absolute. To reside in another EU/EEA state, one must either be working, job-hunting, a student, or {{otherwise}} have sufficient financial resources and health insurance to ensure they do not become a burden on the social services of the host country. States may also require nationals of other EU/EEA states to register their presence with the authorities after {{a certain period of}} time. EU/EEA states may deport nationals of other EU/EEA states and issue <b>exclusion</b> <b>orders</b> against them on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health. For example, those who commit serious crimes or come to rely on welfare may be deported. However, those subjected to such <b>exclusion</b> <b>orders</b> must be able to appeal them after a maximum period of three years, as per EU regulations. Under no circumstances can an EU/EEA state exclude a national of another EU/EEA state for life.|$|R
2500|$|By contrast, Justice Robert Jackson's dissent {{argued that}} [...] "defense {{measures}} will not, and often should not, be held {{within the limits}} that bind civil authority in peace," [...] {{and that it would}} perhaps be unreasonable to hold the military, who issued the <b>exclusion</b> <b>order,</b> to the same standards of constitutionality that apply {{to the rest of the}} government. [...] "In the very nature of things," [...] he wrote, [...] "military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal." [...] He acknowledged the Court's powerlessness in that regard, writing that [...] "courts can never have any real alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eviction {{from the}} West Coast began on March 24, 1942, with Civilian <b>Exclusion</b> <b>Order</b> No. 1, {{which gave the}} 227 Japanese American {{residents}} of Bainbridge Island, Washington six days to prepare for their [...] "evacuation" [...] directly to Manzanar. Colorado governor Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only elected official to publicly denounce the internment of American citizens (an act that cost his reelection, but gained him the gratitude of the Japanese American community, such that a statue of him was erected in the Denver Japantown's Sakura Square). A total of 108 exclusion orders issued by the Western Defense Command {{over the next five}} months completed the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast in August 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Although WRA Director Dillon Myer {{and others}} had pushed for an earlier end to the incarceration, the <b>exclusion</b> <b>order</b> was not {{rescinded}} until January 2, 1945 (postponed until after the November 1944 election, {{so as not to}} impede Roosevelt's reelection campaign). Many younger internees had already [...] "resettled" [...] in Midwest or Eastern cities to pursue work or educational opportunities. (For example, 20,000 were sent to Lake View, Chicago.) The remaining population began to leave the camps to try to rebuild their lives at home. Former inmates were given $25 and a train ticket to their pre-war places of residence, but many had little or nothing to return to, having lost their homes and businesses. Some emigrated to Japan, although many of these individuals were [...] "repatriated" [...] against their will. The camps remained open for residents who were not ready to return (mostly elderly Issei and families with young children), but the WRA pressured stragglers to leave by gradually eliminating services in camp. Those who had not left by each camp's close date were forcibly removed and sent back to the West Coast.|$|E
2500|$|March 24, 1942: General DeWitt {{began to}} issue Civilian <b>Exclusion</b> <b>Orders</b> for {{specific}} areas within [...] "Military Area No. 1."

He was met in the car park by his aunt and girlfriend. In a final act of defiance against the authorities, Wright raised his face up towards a British Army observation tower on the Maze's perimeter fence and shouted [...] "Up the UVF". Following his release he went to Scotland where he lived for a brief period. He had been there only six weeks when he was taken in for questioning by the Anti-Terrorist Squad based at New Scotland Yard. Although he was not charged with any offences, Wright was nonetheless handed an <b>exclusion</b> <b>order</b> banning him from Great Britain. He soon returned to Portadown and initially tried to avoid paramilitarism. He found a job as an insurance salesman and married his girlfriend Thelma Corrigan, by whom he had two daughters, Sara and Ashleen. He took in his sister Angela's son to be raised alongside his own children when she went to live in the United States. He was regarded as a good father. In 1983 he became a born again Christian and began working as a gospel preacher in County Armagh. He had studied Christianity whilst in prison to pass the time.|$|E
