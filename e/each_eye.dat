5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E

40|$|In real life, <b>each</b> <b>eye’s</b> viewing {{direction}} {{is the result}} of the combination of two rotations, the head’s and <b>each</b> <b>eye’s.</b> To a certain extent, the same happens in VR, especially if the field of view (FOV) of the display device is sufficiently large to allow wide eye movements. To determine a user’s gaze direction and point of convergence, one would have to track eye gaze; doing that reliably requires special hardware such as near-eye cameras or electromagnetic sensors that are attached to a user’s temples and capture the orientations of the eyeballs. We suggest a simpler approach to estimating user gaze direction. Most mid-range HMD models suffer from what is called a ”tunnel vision ” effect, which is due to the limited FOVs of the displays. Tunnel vision is regarded as one of the most objectionable features of HMD-based VR systems. However, in our case, this deficiency turns into an advantage, because it allows us to approximate th...|$|R

5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> to the nose and a white one from <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on <b>each</b> <b>eye,</b> the nictitating membrane.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the cane}} toad is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind <b>each</b> <b>eye.</b> The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the three-dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics of saccadic refixations between far and near targets in three behaviorally trained rhesus monkeys. The kinematics underlying these {{rapid eye movements}} can be accurately described by rotations of the eyes in four different planes, namely, first disconjugate rotations in the horizontal plane of regard converging the eyes toward the near target, followed by rotations in <b>each</b> <b>eye's</b> vertical direction plane, and finally, disconjugate rotations in a common frontoparallel plane. This compounded rotation of the eye was underlying an initially fast-rising variable torsion that typically overshot the final torsion, which the eyes attained {{at the time of}} target acquisition. The torsion consisted of a coarse, widely varying component of opposite polarity in the two eyes, which contained a more robust, much smaller modulation that sharply increased toward the end of saccades. The reorientation of the eyes in torsion depended on <b>each</b> <b>eye's</b> azimuth, elevation, and target distance. We conclude that refixation saccades are generated by motor commands that control ocular torsion in concert with the saccade generator, which operates in Donders-Listing kinematics underlying Listing's law...|$|R

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> for visual processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E

Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. <b>Each</b> <b>eye</b> is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. <b>Each</b> <b>eye</b> may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> and a thick black malar streak.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath <b>each</b> <b>eye</b> is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind <b>each</b> <b>eye,</b> and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
