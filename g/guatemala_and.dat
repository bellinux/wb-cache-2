5|$|In {{addition}} to the six tropical cyclones in the basin, another system September27, {{although it was not}} included with the records in the East Pacific, the storm had been listed as Hurricane Ten in the Atlantic basin. Forming south of El Salvador, the tropical depression traveled slowly north. Failing to intensify past a beyond depression status, the system made landfall near the border of <b>Guatemala</b> <b>and</b> El Salvador on September28. Moving inland, the storm did not weaken as it crossed through <b>Guatemala</b> <b>and</b> Mexico. The system quickly strengthened once over the Bay of Campeche, becoming a tropical storm. After entering the bay, the storm intensified into a hurricane, and eventually made landfall in Texas as a Category 2 hurricane. This hurricane was the first officially recorded Atlantic-Pacific crossover tropical cyclone. Overall, monetary losses totaled $10million (1949 USD) and two deaths were attributed to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Edward Alston first {{described}} Oryzomys couesi in 1877, using three specimens from Mexico and Guatemala. He named the animal Hesperomys couesi, {{placing it in}} the now-defunct genus Hesperomys, and noted similarities to the marsh rice rat (then called Hesperomys palustris) and two species now placed in Tylomys. The specific name, couesi, honors American naturalist Elliott Coues, who had done much work on North American rodents. In 1893, Oldfield Thomas wrote that the species, by then placed in the genus Oryzomys as Oryzomys couesi, had caused much confusion about its identity, because the three specimens (one from Cobán, <b>Guatemala,</b> <b>and</b> two from Mexico) used by Alston in fact belonged {{to two or three}} different species. He restricted the name couesi to the animal from <b>Guatemala,</b> <b>and</b> introduced the new name Oryzomys fulgens for one of the Mexican animals. Several other related species were described from the early 1890s onwards and in 1901 Clinton Hart Merriam united many of those into a palustris-mexicanus group of species, which also included the marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|Francisco de Montejo {{meanwhile}} borrowed {{heavily to}} finance his expedition to Honduras, offering his extensive holdings in Mexico as guarantee on the loans, {{as well as}} selling some of his property outright.

Additionally, he purchased ships at Veracruz. In 1537, Francisco de Montejo took up the post of governor, and annulled those encomiendas distributed by Pedro de Alvarado. This resulted in Alvarado's supporters resisting Montejo and his appointees. Montejo assigned Alonso de Cáceres as his captain in Honduras.|$|E
