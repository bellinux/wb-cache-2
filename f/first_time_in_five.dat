5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> {{years for the}} office-based comedy Desk Set (1957).

That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E

5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E

During this stretch, United's lone major title came in 2008, when they won the U.S. Open Cup. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the tail-end of each season, ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs. They had a poor 2010 MLS season, winning only six matches, drawing four and losing 20. In 2011, United again failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign. In 2012, United returned to the playoffs for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years, clinching a berth in the second-to-last week of the season.|$|E

5|$|In later seasons, Bergkamp {{established}} himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a period of success for the club, which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989–90 season for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 matches the following season and became the joint top goalscorer in the league, sharing the accolade with PSV striker Romário.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Bertuzzi {{recorded his}} first career NHL hat trick, recording all three goals {{on the power}} play against San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov in a 6–3 win on December 30, 2000. Bertuzzi recorded a second consecutive 25-goal season in 2000–01, adding 30 assists for 55 points, third in team scoring behind Näslund and Andrew Cassels. His -18 plus-minus rating, however, was a team-worst. The Canucks continued to improve, qualifying for the post-season for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Entering the 2001 playoffs as the final and eighth seed in the West, they were eliminated {{in the first round}} by the Colorado Avalanche. Bertuzzi scored two goals and two assists over four games in his first NHL post-season appearance. In the off-season, Bertuzzi filed for salary arbitration after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks. Both sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year deal on July 26, 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Linden broke {{several more}} Canucks records. In a February 16, 2004, {{game against the}} Colorado Avalanche, he played in his 897th game as a Canuck, passing Smyl.

5|$|After winning 13 {{games in}} 1922–23, Vézina led the Canadiens into the NHL playoffs, where {{they lost the}} two-game, total-goal series to the Senators, who would win the Stanley Cup. The {{following}} season saw Vézina return to leading the league in fewest goals against. His average of 1.97 goals per game {{was the first time}} a goaltender had averaged fewer than two goals against per game. With another 13-win season in 1923–24, the Canadiens reached the NHL playoffs, where they again faced the Ottawa Senators. This time the Canadiens won the series, then defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA before reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> years. Playing the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League, Vézina and the Canadiens won the best-of-three series two games to none, as Vézina recorded a shutout in the second game.
