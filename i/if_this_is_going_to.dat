5000|$|... "The Show Must Go On" [...] {{is a song}} by the British {{rock band}} Queen, {{featured}} as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching {{the end of his}} life; he was dying from complications due to HIV/AIDS, although his illness had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. Mercury was so ill when the band recorded the song in 1990, that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's performance, May states; [...] "I said, 'Fred, I don't know <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be possible to sing.' And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' — vodka down — and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work {{there needs to be a}} new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel space-frame chassis built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production. Murray's 'iStream' simplifies each process with an eighty percent smaller factory with lower cost production, making light weight efficient cars. There are no sheet metal presses, spot welders or paint plants. It would be built local to its market. Murray is currently negotiating production licences. The T25 and T27 were expected to be available in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first game}} in the early {{learning}} software series JumpStart, JumpStart Kindergarten, was created in 1994 by independent developer Fanfare Software (founded 1988) and published by Knowledge Adventures (founded 1991). Fanfare developed two more games JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade before being acquired by Knowledge Adventure in August 9, 1995. Fanfare founder and chairman Barton Listick became vice president of Knowledge Adventure, while his staff relocated to Knowledge Adventure's headquarters in Glendale. Knowledge Adventure founder Bill Gross hoped the acquisition would allow the JumpStart series to expand into international markets, as well as multiple platforms, on-line, and the Internet, to supplement the home and school markets. Meanwhile, Listick was optimistic that the added resources of the larger organisation {{would allow him to}} create a [...] "JumpStart Elementary School" [...] of compelling and exciting children's software. Microtimes retrospectively wrote that the acquisition of the early learning products augmented Knowledge Adventure's strengths. In October, Steve Chadima, vice president of marketing services at Knowledge Adventure said that while JumpStart sales were strong, and the series was about to be extended with JumpStart Second Grade, he said: [...] "We're testing concepts for third grade to see if it is viable...I don't know <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work with higher grade levels." [...] JumpStart Adventures 3rd Grade: Mystery Mountain would end up being released in 1996, and many higher grade games followed. According to Chicago Sun-Times, Knowledge Adventure [...] "started the baby trend when it introduced JumpStart Toddler in 1996". On February 3, 1997, the privately held Knowledge Adventure was acquired by CUC International, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the CUC Software division alongside Davidson, Blizzard Entertainment, and Sierra On-Line; CUC Software would be the label that marketed the JumpStart games. JumpStart Typing, JumpStart Spanish, JumpStart Kindergarten II, JumpStart 1st Grade Reading, JumpStart 1st Grade Math, JumpStart 2nd Grade Math and JumpStart 5th Grade were premiered at the 1997 E3.|$|E

[...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week is a sign that it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience."

3000|$|It’s {{possible}} {{to construct an}} ideology, and I’ve occasionally tried to, in which you combine {{the notion of the}} world as not controllable with the notion that you’re still going to act decisively. I attribute that to people like Don Quixote, but even more people to Chinese philosophy. The thread that runs through Chinese philosophy that fascinates me is the thread that says the leader should be decisive, but skeptical. They should act firmly, but not be very sure that he’s acting correctly. Westerners have great difficulty doing both of those. I used to call it optimism without hope (March 1999). You strike ahead forward, even though {{in the back of your}} head, you say, “I don’t have the vaguest idea <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make any difference.” If you can do that, if you can combine those two, I think you’re closer to being able to survive well. Most of our training is that in order to have great action, you have to have great hopes. A lot of reasons I’m somewhat enthusiastic about that Chinese tradition is that it allows you to have great action without having great hope. “I’m going to charge, probably won’t make any difference, but that’s what I’m going to do.” [...]...|$|E
