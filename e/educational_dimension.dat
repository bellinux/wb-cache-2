40|$|With the {{emergence}} in physics of relativity and quantum theories {{in the first}} decade of this century a paradigm shift took place from a predominantly mechanistic to a dynamic world view. This shift formed the basis of the New Science Movement, including the new physics, in the 1970 s. The movement is international, interdisciplinary, dynamic, and open in its research to the natural and social sciences, arts, and religion. This paper investigates the spiritual and <b>educational</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the New Science Movement. It looks at concepts central to the movement, such as space and time, wave/particle duality, the local and the nonlocal, the parts and the whole, order and disorder (chaos), and knowledge as a network of relations. It tries to show a link to education and spirituality. On the basis of the works from representatives of the New Science Movement, such as David Bohm, Fritjof Capra, David Peat, Danah Zohar, and Ken Wilber, the paper suggests that interpretations of spiritual and <b>educational</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the New Science Movement might be considered for educational processes in general.

50|$|It {{is widely}} known that Coubertin wished {{to convey the}} Olympic idea to the {{contemporary}} world, {{as a means of}} education. He, therefore, restored the Olympic Games, for he recognized the fact that, through the Games, {{he would be able to}} attract the interest of both public opinion and governments, so that the Olympic principles and ideals would eventually be applied to the general education of the young. According to Coubertin, Olympism has a philosophical and <b>educational</b> <b>dimension.</b> He conceived the idea of reviving the ancient Olympic Games, within a framework of global revival, with sport acting as an instrument for the physical, ethical and cultural education of generations of youth. As a result of the rapid and prodigious development and the wide acceptance of the Olympic Games, coupled with the increasing involvement and participation of people in physical education and sports, the need for an immediate resolution of the issue of appropriate staff education became more urgent. In spite of the fact that the Olympic Games in effect conquered the world, Coubertin realized that they were led away from their original intent, as he had visualized it.When Karl Diem, a leading figure in the German sports, came to Greece, in 1938, for the burial of Coubertin’s heart in the commemorative stele that had been erected in 1927 in Ancient Olympia, it appears that he shared his idea of establishing this important center of philosophical research in Ancient Olympia, based on the model of the Institute of Olympic Studies that already operated in Berlin, with Ioannis Ketseas, Member of IOC for Greece, visionary of that time. The final solution was realized when, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee approved the proposal of John Ketseas. This proposal provided for the establishment of an International Olympic Academy and was a product of Ketseas' cooperation with the well known internationally, philhellene and sports scientist, Carl Diem.The Hellenic Olympic Committee, with the moral support of the International Olympic Committee, set the foundations and commenced the running of the IOA from 1961, close to the holy Altis, nearby ancient Olympia, as an invaluable gift of Greece to international Olympism.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to scrutinize the <b>educational</b> <b>dimension</b> of popular social {{movements}} and, from such a viewpoint, to identify their critical and emancipatory educational potentialities. The main issue is to understand how popular social movements are educational, not only to their militants, but also to social organizations, the State and society as a whole. In order to meet such challenges, references have been drawn on contributions by Boaventura de Sousa Santos so as to validate criticism to the hegemonic epistemology, particularly the monoculture of knowledge and linear time, contrasting it to the southern epistemology stressing the ecologies of knowledge and temporality. In order to provide validity to the perspective of temporalities, other contributions have been considered, such as those by Walter Benjamin and Edward Thompson. Finally, the experience of organization of landless farmers in the early 1980 s in Encruzi- lhada Natalino, Ronda Alta/RS is analyzed.
