5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> over the misgivings of many members.

5|$|The cyclone dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across Puerto Rico, peaking at 11.13inches (283mm) near Ponce. The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island, including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at several feet above flood stage. <b>Its</b> <b>passage</b> left about 79,000people without power and 144,000 without water.

Later, Emilia produced similar {{conditions in the}} southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, where <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> caused minor damage and flooding. Moisture from Emilia reached the southwestern United States, producing thunderstorms and flash flooding in Arizona, as well as beneficial rainfall in southern California. No deaths were reported in association with Emilia.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|Bob left {{extensive}} damage throughout New England in its wake, totaling approximately $1.5billion (1991 USD, $ USD). This made {{it one of}} the costliest United States hurricanes at the time; as of 2013, it ranked thirty-second in the category. In addition, seventeen fatalities were reported in association with Bob. The loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas. There were six confirmed tornadoes during <b>its</b> <b>passage.</b> Bob is the most recent hurricane to hit the New England states directly as a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{damage from}} the storm was limited; potent gusts uprooted {{numerous}} trees and blew debris onto streets throughout Basse-Terre. One road was blocked off to traffic during <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> as a precautionary measure, but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals {{of no more than}} 1inch (25mm). Winds in the area were also limited; the highest gust was experienced on Buck Island, measuring 52mph (83km/h).|$|E
5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began {{to take a more}} northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an ill-defined center. By September24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe, admiral of the British Channel Fleet, {{was aware}} of the convoy's nature and {{destination}} long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block <b>its</b> <b>passage.</b> Sending several small squadrons to protect British commerce crossing the Bay of Biscay, Howe detailed Admiral George Montagu with six battleships to search for the convoy in the south of the Bay while Howe took {{the main body of the}} fleet, 26 ships of the line, to patrol near Brest.|$|E

5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in <b>its</b> <b>passage</b> and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear {{on the floor of}} the other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for <b>its</b> <b>passage.</b> Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E
5|$|On February2, a non-frontal low {{formed in}} the western Caribbean Sea {{two months after the}} end of the {{hurricane}} season.
