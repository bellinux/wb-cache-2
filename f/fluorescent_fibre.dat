40|$|Elastin is an {{essential}} protein found {{in a variety of}} tissues where resilience and flexibility are needed, such as the skin and the heart. When aiming to engineer suitable implants, elastic fibres are needed to allow adequate tissue renewal. However, the visualization of human elastogenesis remains in the dark. To date, the visualization of human tropoelastin (TE) production in a human cell context and its fibre assembly under live cell conditions has not been achieved. Here, we present a long-term cell culture model of human dermal fibroblasts expressing fluorescence-labelled human TE. We employed a lentiviral system to stably overexpress Citrine-labelled TE to build a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibre</b> network. Using immunofluorescence, we confirmed the functionality of the Citrine-tagged TE. Furthermore, we visualized the fibre assembly {{over the course of several}} days using confocal microscopy. Applying super resolution microscopy, we were able to investigate the inner structure of the elastin-fibrillin- 1 fibre network. Future investigations will allow the tracking of TE produced under various conditions. In tissue engineering applications the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibre</b> network can be visualized under various conditions or it serves as a tool for investigating fibre degradation processes in disease-in-a-dish-models...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{records of}} single fibre action {{potentials}} (SFAPs) {{have always been}} obtained at unknown distance from the active muscle fibre. A new experimental method has been developed enabling the derivation of the recording distance in animal experiments. A single fibre is stimulated with an intracellular micropipette electrode. The same electrode is used thereafter for labelling with an auto-fluorescent dye, Lucifer Yellow. In this method there is no use of chemical fixation. The tissue structure is kept as well as possible. In cross-sections the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibre</b> is seen and its position is quantitized {{with respect to the}} tip of one or more recording wire electrodes. Morphometric data, such as the recording distance and the fibre cross-sectional area, are used for the interpretation of parameters of the SFAPs (peak-peak amplitude, time between the first positive and negative peaks). The present results show that within 300 μm recording distance is not as dominant for the SFAP shape as expected. The method offers also a direct check of the relation between the muscle fibre; diameter and the conduction velocity of the action potential. In the present small set of data there is no simple linear relationship...|$|E

Many brightly green-fluorescent nerve cell perikarya {{were found in the}} nucleus dorsolateralis and ventromedialis, in the nucleus posterioris periventricularis, in the nucleus recessus lateralis and posterioris. They also occurred in the mesencephalic nucleus lateralis valvulae, in the metencephalic nucleus gustatorius secundus and near the ventricular borders of the facial and vagal lobes in the myelencephalon. Many <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> and nerve terminals were localized in the frontal and medio-lateral parts of the telencephalon, showing fluorescent connections to the caudal parts. In the diencephalon, MA-fibres branched in a horizontal and ventral tract, leading to the medulla oblongata and the hypothalamic nuclei, respectively. There were laterally situated fibres connecting the hypothalamic nuclei with the medulla and the nucleus gustatorius secundus. Many <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> were found in the middle layers of the tectum opticum, in the torus semicircularis, in the lobus inferior and in the medulla oblongata.

40|$|This body of {{research}} was exhibited over four days in the Perth Institute of Contemporary Art, located in the centre of Perth. It {{was one of the}} satellite events of the Space Between conference. The work represented the start of an AHRB funded project which ran from 2003 to 2004. It involved the development of handwoven textiles which exploited computer technology, challenging the notion of repeat pattern associated with dobby weaving. It sought to explore boundaries of scale and composition in relation to the woven image by investigating practical methods: controlled dye techniques, introduction and manipulation of light responsive yarns and computer-controlled jacquard and dobby technology. A key element of the research was the quest for a singular aesthetic centring on the pieces and their presentation within an architectural environment. At this half-way stage of the project – and following extensive trials - the final pieces had evolved as three-dimensional structures; precision-made, shallow frames, supporting and tensioning the woven lengths, concealing and enclosing UV lights which played the part of effectively backlighting and subtly activating <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres,</b> strategically woven into in the textile composition...|$|R

40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 6 is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{now widely}} recognized {{to contribute to}} the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL- 6 that could be neutralized by an IL- 6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL- 6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43 -kDa growth-associated protein (GAP- 43) was lower in slices treated with the IL- 6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL- 6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP- 43. Co-culture of CA 3 hemi-slices from thy 1 -YFP mice with CA 1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL- 6 -treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL- 6 {{plays an important role in}} CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the rat {{have shown that the}} neocortical dopaminergic afferents, {{originating}} in the mesencephalon, terminate in those areas of the frontal lobe which receive projections from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus i. e., the prefrontal cortex. In order to clarify whether this overlap is accidental for the rat or a consistent feature of several species we have compared the projection areas of the ventral tegmental area and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in three species, rat, opossum and tree shrew, using HRP injections in combination with glyoxylic acid histofluorescence method. The results have shown, first, that the area innervated by the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is localized in {{a different part of the}} frontal lobe in each species: dorsolateral in the opossum, anteromedial, polar and suprarhinal in the rat and frontopolar in the tree shrew. Secondly, this area alone in each species receives projections from the ventral tegmental area. Thirdly, this area alone receives a dense innervation in the deep cortical layers by <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> probably containing dopamine. The neighbouring neocortical areas receive afferents neither from the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus nor from the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum; their catecholamine innervation is mainly confined to the superficial layers and appears to be of noradrenergic nature. Although the techniques used did not allow a precise determination of the borders of the two projection areas and, therefore, the exact degree of overlap, it appears that mesencephalic dopaminergic innervation is a characteristic feature of the prefrontal cortex in the mammalian brain...|$|R
40|$|Portions of {{bronchial}} wall, free of neoplasm, {{were obtained}} from human lung resected for nearby tumour. The bronchial tissue was freeze dried, fixed in formaldehyde vapour and sections examined by fluorescence microscopy. Wispy green fibres {{with the appearance of}} amine-containing nerves were seen associated with the gland acini. Fluorescent cells were also found at this location and infrequently in the epithelium. Fluorescence was blocked by pretreatment of the sections with sodium borohydride; it faded in ultraviolet light and was enhanced by incubation of the tissue with L-dopa. All these features are characteristic of specific formaldehyde-induced fluorescence of biogenic amines. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> were not identified either in the smooth muscle of the airway or associated with the epithelium, although background fluorescence may have masked them at these sites. Observations by electron microscopy of human bronchial wall showed that, close to gland acini, there were nerves containing large dense-cored vesicles suggesting that they were sympathetic. After incubation of the tissue with 5 -hydroxydopamine, nerves containing labelled vesicles were seen as close as 1 micron to the gland acini, though none were seen to run between the acinar cells. It is argued that these were sympathetic nerves and were close enough to the gland acini to influence their secretions. Nerves containing vesicles labelled with 5 -hydroxydopamine were also seen in close association with smooth muscle cells indicating a direct sympathetic innervation of the bronchial smooth muscle. These observations are contrary to recent suggestions that the sympathetic nervous system acts only indirectly in the lungs...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of neurons and fibres containing monoamines (MA, that is noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin) was {{studied in the}} brain of the weakly electric fish, Eigenmannia lineata, by formaldehyde-induced fluorescence histochemistry. Control experiments using a catecholamine-precursor (Dopa), a MA-depleting (reserpine), and a MA-accumulating (nialamide) drug, together with microspectrofluorometric measurements, allowed to distinguish specific (MA) from unspecific (for example lipofuscine) fluorescence. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) assays of MA of untreated brains yielded 313 ± S. E. 24 ng/g brain tissue noradrenaline, 96 ± S. E. 19 ng/g dopamine, and 71 ± S. E. 12 ng/g serotonin (N = 12 in each case). The highest density of MA-perikarya was found, as in other species, in the diencephalon: {{in the region of}} the nucleus praeopticus periventricularis (npp), in the nucleus ventromedialis (nvm), in the nucleus posterior periventricularis (nppv), and in the hypothalamic nucleus recessus lateralis (nrl) and nucleus recessus posterior (nrp). The mesencephalic torus semicircularis, the "super-laminated" key structure of sensory-motor integration in gymnotids, contained monoamines in the large T-cells of layer VI. Both types of cells of the medullary pacemaker nucleus (pm) of the electric organ, the smaller pacemaker and the larger relay cells, showed specific, yellow fluorescence indicating the presence of monoamines. Fluorescent MA-fibres in the frontal, medial and lateral parts of the telencephalon connected with hypothalamic and midbrain areas. Several electroreceptive layers of the torus semicircularis (layers V, VIII, IX, XI, XIII) showed a clearly recognisable and in some parts dense network of MA-fibres.

40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from neurones of the guinea-pig submucous plexus. Inhibitory synaptic potentials (i. p. s. p. s) were compared with hyperpolarizations evoked by brief, local applications of noradrenaline and by superfusion with adrenoceptor agonists. Hyperpolarizing potentials elicited by brief applications of noradrenaline were similar to the i. p. s. p. in latency of onset, amplitude, time course, conductance increase, reversal potential and ionic dependence. Both responses were blocked by low concentrations of Ba 2 + and quinine. 6 -hydroxydopamine selectively and irreversibly abolished the i. p. s. p. and resulted in a complete loss of catecholamine <b>fluorescent</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> in the submucous plexus. The alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, phentolamine, yohimbine and RX 781094, reversibly blocked the i. p. s. p. and the noradrenaline hyperpolarization. Prazosin, propranolol, atropine and naloxone {{had no effect on}} these responses. Superfusion with noradrenaline and clonidine produced dose-dependent membrane hyperpolarizations. Noradrenaline and clonidine dose-hyperpolarization curves were shifted to the right in a parallel fashion by alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists. Determination of the dissociation equilibrium constants for phentolamine, yohimbine and RX 781094 showed that the hyperpolarization produced by noradrenaline perfusion is due to alpha 2 -adrenoceptor activation. It is concluded that the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves activates post-synaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, resulting in the K+ conductance increase which underlies the i. p. s. p. in submucous plexus neurones...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{cephalopod}} molluscs, {{particularly the}} octopods, are highly developed macrophageous predators {{which have a}} pronounced ability to learn. Striking resemblances are found between these animals and the vertebrates, particularly the fish. The study of cephalopods therefore provides an opportunity to examine systems which are composed of structural units common to molluscs but which may be similar in function and performance to those of vertebrates. This investigation concerns the alimentary canal and its innervation in the lesser octopus Eledone cirrhosa. Detailed anatomical investigation shows the alimentary canal of E. cirrhosa to be {{very similar to that}} of the better known Octopus vulgaris. Current concepts of the functions of the alimentary organs are discussed utilizing data from both E. cirrhosa and O. vulgaris. Silver staining reveals a basic pattern of innervation in the alimentary organs. Large nerve trunks running in the external collagenous layer give rise to a nerve plexus within the circular muscle. The longitudinal muscle plexus arises from branches of the circular muscle plexus or direct from the nerves of the external layer, Nerves of both plexuses contact muscle fibres in an 'en passant' manner. Fibres run out from the longitudinal muscle to the subepithelium, where they are observed associated with muscle fibres and beneath the epithelial basal lamina. Good evidence for fibres crossing into the epithelium was observed only in the cuticularized regions of the digestive tract. The digestive gland ducts differ from this pattern in the very large numbers of major nerves seen in their external and muscular regions. Outwith the alimentary ganglia nerve cells are only regularly observed within the major intestinal nerves. Receptor like cells were also repeatedly observed only in the posterior intestine. These results axe compared with data from O. vulgaris and the physiological evidence for the presence of receptors. The blood vessels of the alimentary canal are innervated at all levels. The distribution of other densely staining cells is reported. Evidence for the presence of particular neurotransmitters within the alimentary canal and alimentary nerve centres is reviewed. Fluorescence histochemistry shows that at least two types of nerves are present in the alimentary wall. The majority axe aminergic (including those associated with blood vessels and some sphincters), as the pattern of fluorescent nerves is predominantly that shown by silver studies. However, fluorescent nerves decrease and then disappear anteriorly from the crop/oesophageal sphincter and posteriorly from the mid-intestine. The stomach has fluorescent nerves, other than those associated with blood vessels. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> enter the gut via the sympathetic and possibly the digestive gland duct nerves. Non-fluorescent fibres enter via the atrio-rectal nerves and from the gastric ganglion. The fluorescence is ascribed to catecholamines as no evidence of 5 HT was obtained, Specific fluorescence was also observed in some cells of the subepithelium and the external region. These results are discussed with reference to available physiological data. The anterior intestine was the representative region chosen for fine structural studies. These show the alimentary muscles to be the same basic type (cross or pseudo-striated) as that found in cephalopod somatic or heart muscle. Three types of myomuscular and neuromuscular junctions axe described. The presence of mineralized concretions (spherites) in the external layer of the intestine, together with the complex relations of its epithelial cells and heavy vascularization suggest a secondary function of mineral and/or water balance for this organ. These results are discussed. Finally, a pathological condition affecting the octopuses during this study is described...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate {{relationships between the}} structure of the mandibular gland of the sheep and its secretory activity in response to feeding, direct stimulation of autonomic nerves, or pharmacological agents that mimic the action of autonomic transmitters. Forty-five crossbred Romney ewes and wethers were used in acute experiments and twenty-two in chronic experiments. Histochemical and electron microscopical examinations of the structure of mandibular glands confirmed that their secretory endpieces are composed of mucous tubulo-acinar cells and seromucous demilunes. The mucous acini contained a single type of electron lucent granules, whereas the granules of demilunes typically exhibited a tripartite structure. The intercalated ducts were relatively short and lined by non-secretory, simple cuboidal cells and occasional basal cells. Striated ducts were numerous and lined by four cell types, the most common of which (type-I) were tall, columnar, electron lucent cells with well developed membrane infoldings basally with associated mitochondria and small, dense, apical bodies. Myoepithelial cells were distributed densely around the secretory endpieces and within the basement membranes. Myoepithelial cells were also found embracing the intercalated duct cells. Both AChE-positive and biogenic-amine <b>fluorescent</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> were present around the secretory endpieces and the walls of blood vessels. Fewer biogenic-amine <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fibres</b> were seen in relation to duct cells. Electron microscopy showed unmyelinated fibres in both epilemmal and hypolemmal sites. The epilemmal axons were frequently found close to a variety of effector cells, while hypolemmal axons were observed occasionally in the intercellular space between adjacent striated duct cells and between intercalated duct and mucous cells. Axons containing large granular vesicles were also found within interstitial nerve bundles. Mandibular secretion was studied after cannulation of the mandibular duct in both acute and chronic experiments. In anaesthetized animals, stimulation of either the chorda lingual nerve (3 - 8 V, 5 - 10 Hz, 0. 2 msec) or injection of carbachol (40 µg kg- 1 body weight, iv) within 10 - 25 sec caused a copious secretion (0. 33 - 0. 74 g min- 1) of low protein content (0. 44 - 1. 56 mg ml- 1). This response was completely blocked by atropine (0. 1 mg kg- 1 body weight). In contrast, stimulation of cervical sympathetic trunk (3 - 8 V, 5 - 10 Hz, 0. 2 msec) after a latency of 35 - 102 sec caused a meagre secretion (0. 01 - 0. 06 g min- 1) of high protein concentration (4. 02 - 25. 68 mg ml- 1). Isoprenaline had similar effects. Secretory responses to sympathetic stimulation were blocked by propranolol (1. 0 mg kg- 1 body weight). Studies involving gel electrophoresis demonstrated major protein bands exclusively in the sympathetic nerve or isoprenaline stimulated saliva. These major protein components (both soluble and insoluble) were found by immunocytochemical studies to be localized in the demilunes and some striated duct cells of the resting gland. It was found that in sheep fed lucerne chaff (ca. 1, 000 g daily) a rapid and sustained mandibular flow only occurred during eating, although, short term increases were seen, for example, during drinking. Flow was absent during rumination and slight (0. 95 ± 0. 09 g h- 1) or absent at rest. Saliva produced during eating had its highest protein concentration almost immediately as eating commenced (1. 65 ± 0. 06 mg ml- 1) and remained at a high level during the first hour of eating (1. 55 ± 0. 06 mg ml- 1) Propranolol (1. 0 mg kg- 1 body weight, iv) caused significant reductions in protein secretion during eating (P<. 001) without associated changes in flow. Gel electrophoretic studies confirmed the presence of a major protein band similar to soluble protein band X found in sympathetically evoked saliva. The intensity of this major protein band in saliva collected during eating was also reduced after propranolol treatment. Saliva collected during teasing had a high protein concentration (2. 73 ± 0. 20 mg ml- 1). It is concluded that sympathetic activation was involved mainly early in the eating period and that parasympathetic nerves were active throughout. The latter was confirmed by a great reduction in flow after injection of atropine (0. 1 mg kg- 1, iv). Morphological studies of the glands of sheep whose food had been withheld for 20 hours revealed that both the mucous acini and seromucous demilunes were filled with secretory granules. Stimulation of the chorda lingual nerve for 2 - 4 hours caused acini to discharge their contents of secretory granules, but no appreciable changes in the demilunes. On the other hand, stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk produced varying degrees of degranulation in the demilunes, with, in some cells, vacuolation. Infusion of isoprenaline (2 h; 0. 3 µg kg- 1 min- 1) produced similar changes in demilunes. Striated duct cells showed reduced PAS-staining, and disruption of their basal regions, particularly after stimulation of sympathetic nerves. Concurrent stimulation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves resulted in a combination of the above separate effects. Eating led to extensive degranulation and greater evidence of synthesis in the mucous acini than parasympathetic nerve stimulation, the changes increasing with the duration of eating, and a depletion of secretory granules in demilunes that could be prevented by propranolol. (1. 2 mg kg- 1 body weight, iv). The morphological changes in demilunes were not proportional to the duration of eating but were greatest in its early phases. Evidence of small dense bodies which were apparently discharged via the apical membrane of striated duct cells and a loss of PAS-staining in these cells suggest that they secrete during eating. However, neither damage to striated duct cells nor secretory endpieces was evident. The results suggest that the sheep mandibular gland is naturally stimulated by both divisions of the autonomic nervous system, with acinar cells predominantly under the parasympathetic and demilunes under the sympathetic control. The sympathetic stimulation of salivary protein secretion appears to be mainly mediated via a β-adrenergic mechanism whereas the secretion of fluid and probably also mucus glycoproteins is an atropine-sensitive parasympathetic effect. On both morphological and physiological grounds it is suggested that in sheep mandibular glands, myoepithelial cell contraction is important in assisting the secretion of viscous saliva. Further studies on the following areas would seem appropriate: (i) systematic morphological studies using stereological analysis of changes in the acinar cells, demilunes, striated ducts and their cytoplasmic components; (ii) ultrastructural examinations of the innervation pattern in this gland under normal conditions, after specific denervation and reinnervation; (iii) studies of the nature and origin of the salivary proteins secreted during eating and nerve stimulation and (iv) the use of chronically cannulated animals for studies of the influence of different conditions of feeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} {{to measure the}} concentration of hydrogen peroxide in solution is critical for many disparate application areas, including wine quality sensing, aviation fuel monitoring and embryology. This thesis covers work related {{to the development of}} a low-volume hydrogen peroxide sensor, utilising microstructured optical fibres to perform measurements on small (< 20 μL) sample volumes. This work has used the interaction between the guided light and fluorescent molecules within the holes of microstructured optical fibres to perform detection. This interaction has been used firstly to optimise the sensing architecture, using photostable Quantum dots as a characterisation tool. This work also has potential biosensing applications, using the Quantum dots was fluorescent labels for antibody reactions. This thesis covers work related to lowering the effective detection limit using microstructured optical <b>fibres</b> to detect <b>fluorescent</b> molecules, utilising novel glasses and implementing a theoretical model to reduce the amount of background signal that is generated within the fibre. New candidates for <b>fluorescent</b> molecules in <b>fibre</b> are also examined, resulting in a further reduction of the minimum detectable concentration. The second use of this interaction with the guided light involved the use of fluorophores that react with hydrogen peroxide to produce an increase in fluorescence. This increase in fluorescence can then be observed by monitoring the signal from either end of the fibre. By establishing a calibration curve that gives an expected fluorescence signal for a given hydrogen peroxide concentration it is then possible to correlate the observed fluorescence with the concentration of hydrogen peroxide present within the sample. Additionally this thesis presents practical improvements to microstructured fibre dip sensors, including splicing the sensing fibres to commercial optical fibres as well as methods for mixing low volumes of liquids to enable rapid detection of target molecules.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and distribution of}} nerve fibres and of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors were examined in the myotomes of Xenopus laevis during normal development. This muscle is well-suited for investigating temporal relationships during neuromuscular synaptogenesis because {{the age of the}} Xenopus embryo at the onset of innervation can be assessed with an accuracy of about one hour. Myotomal nerve fibres were visualized after staining them with nitroblue tetrazolium and ACh receptors were examined after exposure to alpha-bungarotoxin labelled with 125 I or <b>fluorescent</b> dye. Nerve <b>fibres</b> were seen in the myotomes of some embryos as early as stage 19 (20. 75 hr) and in virtually all embryos by stage 24 (26. 25 hr). From the outset they were located mainly at the ends of the myotomes, but some myotomes also exhibited nerve fibres in more central regions. ACh receptors were already present in myotomes by stage 19 (20. 75 hr) and initially had a widespread, uniform distribution. The density of extrajunctional ACh receptors increased until stage 36 (50 hr) and then declined less than 3 -fold over the next 10 days of development. Discrete patches of high ACh receptor density began to appear at the ends of the myotomes at stage 22 (24 hr) and were seen in almost all embryos by stage 26 (29. 5 hr). ACh receptor patches were also seen in central regions of some myotomes and these were usually aligned in patterns which resembled the course of nerve fibres. The present findings suggest that myotomal muscle cells in Xenopus embryos begin to acquire ACh receptors shortly before the arrival of nerve fibres and that discrete patches of ACh receptors begin to form at presumptive synaptic sites on the average about 3 hr after the arrival of the nerve fibres. The latter delay is considerably shorter than that in developing rat muscle. The temporal and spatial relationships between nerve fibres and the development of ACh receptor patches in Xenopus myotomes in vivo are consistent with findings in Xenopus cell cultures which indicate that nerve fibres can rapidly induce ACh receptor localization at sites of nerve [...] muscle contact...|$|R
40|$|Structural and ultrastructural {{observations}} on the normal and denervated carotid body and carotid sinus of 50 lambs and 7 adult sheep (Ovis aries) were made employing various anatomical, histological, fluorescent, microscopical and ultrastructural techniques. Chronic denervation experiments were performed by (i) unilateral sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve with or without sectioning of the glossopharyngeal nerve and pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve, and (ii) unilateral sectioning of the sympathetic filament (external carotid nerve) to the carotid trifurcation, or unilateral cranial cervical ganglionectomy. The gross anatomical studies demonstrated that there is variation {{in the mode of}} branching of the common carotid artery and the pattern of the venous drainage of the entire carotid region. The position, blood supply and venous drainage of the carotid body were also found to be variable. The major arterial source of supply for almost all the structures associated with the carotid trifurcation is the occipital artery. The dual innervation of the carotid body and the carotid sinus from the glossopharyngeal nerve (via the carotid sinus nerve) and the cranial cervical ganglion (via the external carotid nerve) is described. From the histological studies it was found that there is widespread distribution of carotid body tissue at the carotid trifurcation. Two major cell types were seen in the carotid body, the chief or type I cells and the sustentacular or type II cells. The former included "light" and "dark" cells but {{it was not possible to}} identify these cells with certainty under the electron microscope. The carotid body and carotid sinus receive predominantly glossopharyngeal fibres which were traced close to the type I cells in the carotid body, and in the carotid sinus to the deeper tunica adventitia. The large diameter nerve fibres which degenerated after sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve, were seen to terminate in close association with the type I cells. The carotid body cells or the carotid sinus wall did not exhibit any marked morphological changes after sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve or after sympathectomy; however, a marked dilatation of the blood vessels was seen in both the carotid body and carotid sinus. The carotid sinus is a swelling, dilatation or diverticulum at the origin of the occipital artery or the occipitoascending pharyngeal arterial trunk. The extent of the elastic tissue varies according to the position of the carotid body. The carotid sinus is predominantly of the elastic type. The terminal nerve fibres end as diffuse endings. The large diameter myelinated nerve fibres which degenerated after sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve are suggested to be of glossopharyngeal origin, whereas the fine nonmyelinated fibres which could be traced to the medioadventitial border or superficial media are suggested to be of sympathetic origin. Both the normal and sympathetically denervated carotid body cells exhibited intense fluorescence, the intensity of the fluorescence remaining the same up to 8 weeks after sympathectomy. It is suggested that normal carotid body cells contain catecholamines consisting mainly of noradrenaline and dopamine which are not affected by chronic sympathetic denervation. <b>Fluorescent</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> were seen on the outermost layer of the adventitia of the normal carotid sinus, along the carotid body artery, and in the adventitia and the medio-adventitial border of the common carotid and external carotid arteries. They were not present in the denervated specimens. It is suggested that the carotid sinus, carotid body artery and the common carotid and external carotid arteries receive sympathetic adrenergic innervation. Ultrastructuaral studies confirmed the presence of type I and type II cells in the carotid body. The predominant type I cells are characterized by the presence of numerous dark-cored osmiophilic vesicles and mitochondria. The type II cells are irregular shaped cells with a characteristic nucleus, extensive cytoplasmic processes, fewer mitochondria and indistinct endoplasmic reticulum. Blood vessels are numerous in the carotid body. The nerve endings are of two types - large and small, the former being particularly associated with type I cells. Sometimes fine nonmyelinated small axons were seen in the small grooves of the type I cells. Most of the large diameter myelinated nerve fibres and the large type of nerve endings degenerated after sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve. The degeneration was almost complete at 2 - 8 weeks after nerve transection. After sympathectomy small diameter nonmyelinated nerve fibres which were usually related to the blood vessels, degenerated. It is suggested that the large diameter myelinated nerve fibres and large nerve endings belong to the glossopharyngeal system, and the small diameter nonmyelinated nerve fibres, which are usually related to the blood vessels, are from the sympathetic system. The ovine carotid sinus presented a very similar fibre architecture to that found in the laboratory animals, and the endothelial cells possessed complex endothelial folds. Those nerve terminals which possessed indistinct perineural sheaths and few electron dense-cored vesicles degenerated after sectioning of the carotid sinus nerve, and these nerve terminals are suggested to be derived from the glossopharyngeal nerve. As the nonmyelinated sheathed nerve terminals at the medioadventitial border of the carotid sinus degenerated after sectioning of the external carotid nerve or cranial cervical ganglionectomy, they are suggested to be from the sympathetic system...|$|R
