5|$|Later in 1917, the Argentines had to sharply curtail Rivadavias {{activities}} {{because of}} a <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage,</b> but they voyaged to the United States with the Argentine ambassador in 1918. Rivadavia then took on a load of gold bullion and brought it back to Argentina, docking in Puerto Belgrano on 23 September 1918. In December 1920, Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} the Strait of Magellan. On the 2nd, the ship called on Valparaíso in Chile; 25 days later, it took part in an international naval review. Two years later, Rivadavia was placed into reserve.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Kent and Glasgow {{approached}} Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to Dresden by one of her pinnaces, which {{had been sent to}} patrol the entrance to the bay. Dresden was unable to maneuver, owing to her <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage,</b> and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. Glasgow opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located Dresden in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, Kent joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Div Cav {{spent the}} first three weeks of the pursuit camped near Bardia. On 2 December, as part of the {{outflanking}} move around El Agheila, the regiment began an eight-day drive on transporters to El Haseiat. After unloading its vehicles, the regiment continued its flanking movement. On 14 December, it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, with which it spent the night. C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16:00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment. The German 15th Panzer Division, halted on the road due to a <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage,</b> was targeted by Div Cav. During the night, the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated. At 05:45 the next morning, XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack the Germans and the regiment was advised to expect an attack from the east by a hundred tanks. Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south-west, along the line of its previous advance. When the regiment had gone back , it surprised a German column. ASquadron engaged, as the other squadrons hastily withdrew. In the evening, the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, she {{participated in}} {{numerous}} patrols and sorties into the Mediterranean, both to escort Italian convoys to North Africa and {{in attempts to}} catch the British Mediterranean Fleet. In November 1940, the British launched an air raid on Taranto; Caio Duilio was hit by one torpedo launched by a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber, which caused significant damage. Repairs lasted some five months, after which the ship returned to convoy escort duties. A <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> immobilized {{the bulk of the}} Italian surface fleet in 1942, and Caio Duilio remained out of service until the Italian surrender in September 1943. She was thereafter interned at Malta until 1944, when the Allies permitted her return to Italian waters. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the post-war Italian navy, primarily as a training ship. Caio Duilio was placed in reserve for a final time in 1953; she remained in the Italian navy's inventory for another three years before she was stricken from the naval register in late 1956 and sold for scrapping the following year.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In western Grenada, high waves {{affected}} {{much of the}} coastline, destroying 21small {{boats and}} causing significant beach erosion. The waves covered the entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened {{the foundation of the}} runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage.</b> In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6million; this represented 27percent of the island's gross domestic product. Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.|$|E

5|$|Romas keel {{was laid}} by the Italian {{shipbuilder}} Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, {{and she was}} launched on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and {{was assigned to the}} Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Vittorio Venetos because the <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century, coal was {{discovered}} nearby {{in the area that}} would become Carbondale. This became especially significant as the British restricted export of British coal to the United States after the War of 1812, creating a <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> in rapidly expanding New York City. To get the coal to New York, developers proposed a gravity railroad from Carbondale to Honesdale, along with a canal from Honesdale to the Hudson River at Kingston.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1943, the Corps {{followed}} advancing {{troops in}} Ukraine, but its actions were limited by fuel and ammunition rationing. In {{the beginning of}} Battle of the Dnieper, the Corps could only dispatch two active regiments to Bukrin bridgehead; the rest was grounded by <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage.</b> The situation improved when {{the direction of the}} Soviet offensive switched to Lyutezh bridgehead. Kamanin earned the Order of Suvorov for his corp's achievement in the Battle of Kiev (1943). This was followed by action against Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket in January–February 1944 and subsequent Kamenets-Podolsky pocket in March–April.|$|E

25|$|Because of <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> {{during the}} Second World War, the {{trolleybus}} network was expanded in 1943 with line 21 from Skillebekk to Carl Berners plass converted. As {{part of this}} work a trolley line was built from Torshov to Bjølsen Depot to allow buses access to the depot. Oslo Sporveier decided {{at the end of}} the war that some of the tram lines with the least traffic should be closed. At the time trams had both a motorman and a conductor while buses only had a driver, and Oslo Sporveier could cut operating costs through this. Oslo Sporveier therefore decided to electrify another three lines. One of these was line 23, which ran from Bjølsen and Linnaaes gate downtown.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{during the}} German {{occupation}} of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed {{the first successful}} and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with gas generators, in response to constant <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage</b> that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that on more than one occasion, the federal {{government}} has threatened to withhold highway funds from states which did not pass certain articles of legislation. Any state which lost highway funding for any extended period would face financial impoverishment, infrastructure collapse or both. Although the first such action (the enactment of a national speed limit) was directly related to highways and done {{in the face of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>shortage,</b> most subsequent actions have had little or nothing to do with highways and have not been done in the face of any compelling national crisis. An example of this would be the federally mandated drinking age of 21, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Critics of such actions feel that when the federal government does this they upset the traditional balance between the states and the federal government.|$|E
