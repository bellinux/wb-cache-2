40|$|Abstract Background Rural {{township}} <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> {{and urban}} community <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> {{play a crucial}} role in the delivery of primary health care in China. Over the past two-and-a-half decades, these health institutions have not been as well developed as high-level hospitals. The limited availability and low qualifications of human resources in health are among the main challenges facing lower-level health facilities. This paper aims to analyse the mobility of health workers in township and community <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> Methods Data used in this paper come from a nationwide survey of health facilities in 2006. Ten provinces in different locations and of varying levels of economic development were selected. From these provinces, 119 rural township <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and 89 urban community <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> were selected to participate in a questionnaire survey. Thirty key informants were selected from these health facilities to be interviewed. Results In 2005, 8. 1 % and 8. 9 % of health workers left township and community <b>health</b> <b>centres,</b> respectively. The <b>health</b> workers in rural township <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had three to 13 years of work experience and typically had received a formal medical education. The majority of the mobile health workers moved to higher-level health facilities; very few moved to other rural township <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> The rates of workers leaving township and community <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> increased between 2000 and 2005, with the main reasons for leaving being low salaries, limited opportunities for professional development and poor living conditions. Conclusion In China, primary health workers in township <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and community <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> move to higher-level facilities due to low salaries, limited opportunities for promotion and poor living conditions. The government already has policies in place to counteract this migration, but it must step up enforcement if rural township <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and urban community centres are to retain health professionals and recruit qualified health workers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Health</b> <b>centres</b> {{are seen}} as a {{preferred}} organization of the modernized and integrated primary care. they are expected to facilitate an accessible contact point for medical care as close to people’s homes. Also, <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> are expected to deliver care in an efficient and effective way, minimizing the referring of patients to care and cure institutions. Methods: The population of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands is described by analysing the dynamics of (currently nearly 200) members of the Dutch branch organizations for Organized Primary Care. In addition, information is collected from their websites and yearend reports. In parallel, we reconstruct the policy and legal arrangements of the Dutch government with regard to the financial support of <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> To explain the interaction between the behaviour of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and developments of the policy environment over time, we apply Porters’ five forces model and the institutional isomorphism theory. Results: Historic l analysis shows that the establishment of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> accelerated in the seventies, then follow a much slower growth rate during the mid-eighties, and then stabilized during the nineties. During the last decade, the establishments of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> started to grow again, but mainly due to mergers and up-scaling resulting in enlarging <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> Towards 2000, the financial support by the government was reduced and largely discarded by the Dutch health system reform in 2006. <b>Health</b> <b>centres</b> strategically reacted by mergers and consolidation, to deal with the new power of health insurers. Discussion: The question remains whether public funding should focus on the establishment or the consolidation of new <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> The potential value of multidisciplinary collaboration seems to develop properly in new residential areas, but its funding also disentangle with the growth of healthcare providers and recipients. Alternatively, public-private partnerships can be considered as new ways to establish integrated primary health care at district level...|$|R
40|$|About {{two decades}} ago, {{changes in the}} demand for primary care in the Netherlands {{resulted}} in {{a need for more}} interprofessional collaboration. <b>Health</b> <b>centres</b> developed as a new supply of integrated care.

The development of this policy and the resulting growth in the number of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> will be reviewed here. In general, this growth is lagging behind initial policy expectations, partly because of a lack of instruments to implement PHC policy. Examination of geographical distribution of <b>health</b> <b>centres,</b> however, shows a variation suggesting that local factors also affect the development of <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> Empirical findings show that the number of newly built houses in an area and the political 'colour' of the alderman for public health play a role in the development of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and thus co-determine the results of a central promotion policy to a certain exten...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Malawi have or will develop non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The current capacity of ART sites {{to provide care}} for NCDs is not known. Aim: This study aimed to assess the capacity of ART sites to provide care for hypertension and diabetes in rural Malawi. Setting: Twenty-five <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> and five hospitals in two rural districts in northern Malawi. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed between March and May 2014 at all facilities. Qualitative interviews were held with three NCD coordinators. Results: Treatment of hypertension and diabetes was predominantly hospital-based. Sixty percent of hospitals {{had at least one}} clinician and one nurse trained in NCD care, whereas 5 % of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had a clinician and 8 % had a nurse trained in NCD care. Hundred percent of hospitals and 92 % of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had uninterrupted supply of hydrochlorothiazide in the previous 6 months, but only 40 % of hospitals and no <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had uninterrupted supply of metformin. Hundred percent of hospitals and 80 % of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had at least one blood pressure machine, and 80 % of hospitals and 32 % of <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> had one glucometer. Screening for hypertension amongst ART patients was only conducted at one hospital and no <b>health</b> <b>centres.</b> At <b>health</b> <b>centres,</b> integrated NCD and ART care was more common, with 48 % (12 / 25) providing ART and NCD treatment in the same consultation. Conclusions: The results reflect the status of the initial stages of the Malawi NCD programme at sites currently providing ART care.  </p...|$|R

Methods: Eight focus group discussions involving a range of health professionals from <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> were conducted in four districts in East Java, Indonesia. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} generate findings. Results: Collaborative practices in Indonesian <b>health</b> <b>centres</b> are directly affected by health professional interactions (personnel level) e hierarchy and lack of role understanding have been reported as barriers to the interactions. These factors are in turn affected by <b>health</b> <b>centre's</b> environment (organisational level) and the Government legislation/policy (health system). The <b>health</b> <b>centre's</b> environment included organisation's culture, team management, physical space, as well as communication and coordination mechanisms.
