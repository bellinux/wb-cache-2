The crane was completed in 1915 and originally was known as the Grosser Schwimmkran, but was christened Langer Heinrich. The crane was built by Demag in Duisburg and the float pontoon for the crane was built by AG Weser. The crane needed to lift ship towers, ship components or sometimes ship hulls. She help assemble the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee and German battleship Tirpitz. The pontoon float is 50.42 m by 30.92 m with a depth draft of 3.05 m. The crane displaced 3,898 tons and was driven by two triple expansion steam engines with 1,000 HP each. The crane had three smaller hoist for lifting 10, 20 and 50 tons. The main hoist is two 125 tonnes cranes. The two 125 ton lifting units could be coupled for a combined lift of 250 tonnes. The crane had a maximum jib tower height of 81.4 m. The crane is self-propelled with two propellers and floats on pontoons. The pontoon has 41 compartments, some of these can be flooded for counterbalance of the object lifted. The superstructure can be rotated 360 degrees. The crane has a deadweight of 2,393 tons. So noted was the crane, she was pictured on some German bank notes, Deutsche Marks.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} compounds {{found in the}} cannabis plant are called cannabinoids. There has been over 85 different cannabinoids found in the plant. The most famous of them all is Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the main psychoactive chemical found in cannabis.Cannabinoid receptors are concentrated in {{certain areas of the}} brain associated with thinking, memory, pleasure, coordination and time perception. THC attaches to these receptors and activates them and affects a person's memory, pleasure, movements, thinking, concentration, coordination, and sensory and time perception. As THC is the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis, Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main non-psychoactive chemical found in cannabis. CBD has gained prominence in the past decade through scientific research and {{has been found to be}} responsible for many of the therapeutic and medicinal properties associated with medical marijuana. Terpenoids also known as Terpenes are organic {{chemical compounds}} produced by many different plants and generally carry aromatic or flavonoid properties. Terpenes are an essential component of resin and are usually a major factor in the essential oils produced by a plant. Terpenes are responsible for the smell and flavor of each strain. While both strains share the same cannabinoids, they vary in levels of THC, CBD, and Terpenes that classify them as Sativa or Indica. Sativa’s cannabinoid profile is dominated by high THC levels and low or no CBD levels. Indica's chemical profile shows a more balanced mix, with moderate THC levels and higher levels of CBD. Indica strains relax muscles and work as general analgesics, also helping with sleep. A cancer patient hoping to relieve the pain from chemotherapy may benefit from the effects of an Indica plant. Sativa strains produce more of a euphoric <b>high,</b> <b>lifting</b> the consumer’s mood and therapeutically relieving stress, indicating Sativas may be useful at relieving anxiety and depression.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a preliminary study for using the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel sidewall boundary-layer removal system with heavy gas sulfur hexafluoride as the test medium. It is shown that the drive motor speed/power of the existing system and the additional heat load on the tunnel heat exchanger are the major problems limiting the boundary-layer removal system performance. Overcoming these problems can provide the capability to remove about 1. 5 percent of the test section mass flow at Mach number M = 0. 8 and about 5 percent at M = 0. 25.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} lifting velocity and container shape on angle of repose, the fixed-base cylinder method was performed using three types of container shape. The container shape was lifted a series of lifting velocities. Six size fractions of iron ore particles ranging from coarser to fine particles were used as the test materials. And the sand-pile calibration method was then used to calibrate the contact parameters of iron ore particles. Results show angle of repose decreased exponentially with the lifting velocity, while it appeared approximately to be invariant to particle shape, for all size fractions. The sand pile highly depends on the container shape at a low lifting velocity but appears to be invariant to particle size for a <b>high</b> <b>lifting</b> velocity. And then a predictive equation is established and a very close agreement between the predicted and measured angle of repose is attained.

40|$|AbstractTransition flow over {{airfoils}} at {{the higher}} angle of attack shows a lot of unsteady phenomena such as local separation regions, boundary layer transition, turbulence and shock boundary layer interaction. These phenomena are associated with high energy loss and adversely effects the aerodynamic loads {{in the form of}} lift loss and drag increase. Controlling the flow through separation delay by suction at different slots, by flaps, by introducing bumps and sophisticated <b>high</b> <b>lifting</b> devices can mitigate the aerodynamic losses. This paper focuses on the delay of boundary layer separation of 2 D NACA 4412 by suction using CFD analysis. Picking out the right suction position augments the aerodynamic performance. So a slot with a width of 2 % of the chord length is placed at five different locations starting from 48 % to 70 % of the chord length. The main part of the paper is related to the selection of a suction position and outcome of different suction pressures at a definite slot. Suction with the lower pressure at a definite position moves the separation of boundary layer in the vicinity of trailing edge of the airfoil most. By suing suctionat suction pressure 65 kPa on 68 % of the chord length of the airfoil with a constant angle 20 with the upper surface of the airfoil, AOA= 130 and M= 0. 6, it is possible to move the transition to turbulent flow about 91 % of the chord length of the airfoil near the trailing edge where it is found at 43 % of the chord length of the airfoil without suction. So the laminar region is extended and the lift increases. Along with this, at low angle of attack, the lift to drag ratio after suction increases about 2. 24 times compared to that of without suction...|$|E

The risks of such operation emerged the need for semi-submersible, heavy-lift vessel or ultimately catamaran vessel design (i. e Pioneering Spirit), all being expensive concepts with <b>high</b> <b>lifting</b> capacities making a single-lift option possible, also ensuring robust operating windows; however, these designs are tailored to be project-speci c and technically redundant. Such way of thinking do not comply with the lean, modular and reusable engineering philosophy Mammoet Global Engineering is introducing via its novel conceptual design counterproposal, under the name Mammoet O shore Platform (MOP); a twin barge concept with proper mechanical couplings would create a modular and thus resusable, less stiff configuration that achieves operational robustness in irregular seas. The technical challenge identi ed is the asymmetric barge roll motion due to the eccentric topside weight and the respective roll hydrodynamic loading. Roll motion in beam waves (900 angle of attack) {{is expected to}} be the dominant design parameter and is addressed via the implementation of a kinematic constraint so that barges and topside roll (f) is synchronized. Furthermore, the barges are modeled to heave and pitch independently, therefore significant differential motions in the corresponding DOF (bank : & flip :) are anticipated and need to be treated; the use of a passive link, modeled as a spring-dashpot, has qualified while its structural parameters will be optimized with the H 1 technique. The research question in hand comprises of MOP concept technical feasibility study which will be quantitatively assessed via the following Key Performance Indices (KPI) : Steady-state dynamic behavior of MOP (constrained barges) against two free oating barges and a catamaran barge of identical geometry speci cations, working entirely in the frequency domain (modeling in linear potential solver Wamit) Steady-state dynamic behavior of MOP (constrained barges & link optimized in H 1) against the model identified in the previous analysis (state-space modeling and control in Matlab) The frequency domain simulations for the case studies tabulate that the roll kinematic constraint has successfully attenuated & shifted the peak response while the link structural properties optimization has minimized the differential barge motions in heave and pitch ensuring wider operational windows and verifying this work ow as a proof of concept.
