40|$|The {{capacity}} of alquitara (a traditional distillation system) to produce cider brandies is evaluated. To do so, the chemical composition of 12 fractions obtained during the distillation {{process and the}} cider brandies obtained from five ciders were analyzed (alcohol strength, methanol, volatile substances, furfural, and metals), taking into account European and Spanish legislation. During the course of distillation, an important increase in methanol, furfural, 2 -phenylethanol, and metals in the last fractions was observed, while fusel oils were more abundant in the first fractions collected. Only acetaldehyde behaved differently, showing a minimum concentration in the middle fractions that might be explained by its formation {{on the surface of}} alquitara. On the other hand, the final <b>distillates</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> means of this method complied with the considered regulations. Worth highlighting in this regard are the low levels of a potential toxin such as methanol, as well as the detection of a constant ratio for methanol, ethanol, and fusel oil for the pairs of cider/spirits analyzed, which could be interpreted as an indication of good uniformity in the distillation system and method, thus guaranteeing product quality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to extract and {{identify}} volatile compounds from pineapple residues generated during concentrated juice processing. Distillates of pineapple residues were obtained using the following techniques: simple hydrodistillation and hydrodistillation by passing nitrogen gas. The volatile compounds present in the distillates were captured by the solid-phase microextraction technique. The volatile compounds were identified in a system of high resolution gas chromatography system coupled with mass spectrometry using a polyethylene glycol polar capillary column as stationary phase. The pineapple residues constituted mostly of esters (35 %), followed by ketones (26 %), alcohols (18 %), aldehydes (9 %), acids (3 %) and other compounds (9 %). Odor-active volatile compounds were mainly identified in the <b>distillate</b> <b>obtained</b> using hydrodistillation <b>by</b> passing nitrogen gas, namely decanal, ethyl octanoate, acetic acid, 1 -hexanol, and ketones such as &# 947;-hexalactone, &# 947;-octalactone, &# 948;-octalactone, &# 947;-decalactone, and &# 947;-dodecalactone. This suggests that the use of an inert gas and lower temperatures helped maintain higher amounts of flavor compounds. These data indicate that pineapple processing residue contained important volatile compounds which can be extracted and used as aroma enhancing products and have high potential for the production of value-added natural essences...|$|R

40|$|The <b>distillates</b> <b>obtained</b> from wine, both raw and aged, {{are highly}} {{appreciated}} alcoholic beverages {{due to the}} refinement and fineness that characterizes them. Romania’s viticultural conditions are very favourable for these products - which in the last centuries have made regions such as Cognac and Armagnac in France famous. In Romania the aged distillate of wine is called “vinars” and in the Republic of Moldova it is named “divin”. This study analyses how the main compositional parameters and volatile compounds {{are influenced by the}} raw material wine, distillation technology, distillation steps, removal of the lower-quality fractions (heads and tails). The raw material used to make the distillates was a mixture of two wines of Fetească albă and Fetească regală, harvest of 2015, from Iasi vineyard. The proposed experimental protocol consisted of the double distillation of a volume of 1000 L of raw material. For the distillation, a simple copper distillery with a deflector was used. From each 10 L of <b>distillate</b> <b>obtained,</b> samples were taken and analysed via gas-chromatography. In the first and second distillation, the largest amounts of acetic acid are found in the head. The highest concentrations of octanoic acid are recorded in tails, as does hexanoic acid. The product obtained after the first distillation recorded an average alcoholic strength of 33. 5 % vol, which increased after the second distillation, so that the final distillate has an alcoholic strength of 58. 5 % vol. Concerning the acid profile, the following can be concluded: Acetic acid can be considerably diminished with the removal of the head fractions; Octanoic, hexanoic and decanoic acids fall into the class of short chain fatty acids, can affect the organoleptic qualities but are easily esterify the resulting compounds giving pleasing odour; aging in oak or mulberry wood barrels of crude distillates to achieve the maximum potential is recommended...|$|R

Pressure-thermal treatment of unmalted cereals, and especially rye grains, resulted in higher ethanol content in mashes in comparison with samples subjected to pressureless liberation of starch.
