5000|$|The {{origins of}} this {{sculpture}} {{are in the}} early object-sculptures the artist made in Mont-roig del Camp with found objects. The objects found were gathered at his workshop and then shaped into the artist's new world. At first, the objects were not placed in the right place; once the creation started there was a rigorous evaluation of their position by the artist. During the second world war, Miró was alone in his ancestral home and landscape in Mont-roig del Camp. He was excluded from his artistic peers {{and the influence of}} art galleries, museums and exhibitions. He extracted natural forms and elements into a new artistic language of found art. Joan Prats, Miró's lifelong friend and collaborator said: [...] "When I take a stone, it is just <b>a</b> stone. When <b>I</b> <b>grab</b> <b>a</b> stone, it is a Miró." [...] In the mid 60s it was realised that the original sculpture was deteriorating and it was re-created in bronze by founders in Paris. Miró himself supervised the texture and controlled patina which he considered to be very important.|$|R

5000|$|Lead artist Michael Provenza recounted how he {{designed}} the hordlings: [...] I got some concept drawings before I started, and I {{was able to}} model them in a 3D software package. To give each animation personality, I acted out what the hordlings would look like when they did something. For example, the shaman is an old dude. I decided he would walk with a gimp. <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> golf club and walked around the office as I imagined that character would. To get {{the motion of the}} walk right, I tried to {{imagine what it would be}} like to walk with long arms, short legs, a big body, and a big head. Then I started animating by hand with the 3D modeling software, Alias, and claymation. It takes about four days to build a character from scratch, animate it, and add texture mapping.|$|E

My still incipient Marxist ideas {{had nothing to do with}} our conduct - it was a spontaneous reaction on our part, as young people with Martí-an, anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and pro-democratic ideas. — Fidel Castro on the Bogotazo, 2009 In June 1947, Castro learned of a planned expedition to overthrow the right-wing government of Rafael Trujillo, a U.S. ally, in the Dominican Republic. Being President of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic, Castro joined the expedition. The military force consisted of around 1,200 troops, mostly Cubans and exiled Dominicans, and they intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947. Graus government stopped the invasion under U.S. pressure, although Castro and many of his comrades evaded arrest. Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests, accompanied by a crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba. In contrast, his former public criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E

The sample consisted of 108 women who had used physical violence with a male partner in the previous 6 months. Almost all the women experienced physical abuse from their male partners. Whereas the women in the sample used more emotional abuse and mod-erate physical violence than their partners, the women were more often victims of sexual violence, injury, and coercive control. Three types of relationships were identified: women as victims (34 %), women as aggressors (12 %), and mixed relationships (50 %), which were of two subtypes—mixed-male coercive (32 %) and mixed-female coercive (18 %). The study illustrates that women’s violence needs to be examined within the con-text of male violence and abuse. The implications of the findings are discussed for researchers and practitioners who work with domestically violent women. He came home drunk one night and started harassing and abusing me.
