But the main {{outlines}} of all schemes {{for an international}} loan are much the same, The countries {{in a position to}} lend assistance, the neutrals, the United Kingdom, and, for the greater portion of the sum required, the United States, must provide foreign purchasing credits for all the belligerent countries of continental Europe, allied and ex-enemy alike. The aggregate sum required might not be so large as is sometimes supposed. Much might be done, perhaps, with a fund of $1,000,000,000 in the first instance. This sum, even if a precedent of a different kind had been established by the cancellation of Inter-Ally War Debt, should be lent and should be borrowed with the unequivocal intention of its being repaid in full. With this object in view, the security for the loan should be the best obtainable, and the arrangements for its ultimate repayment as complete as possible. In particular, it should rank, both for payment of interest and discharge of capital, in front of all Reparation claims, all Inter-Ally War Debt, all internal war loans, and all other Government indebtedness of any other kind. Those borrowing countries who will be entitled to Reparation payments should be required to pledge all such receipts to repayment of the new loan. And all the borrowing countries should be required to place their customs duties on a <b>gold</b> <b>basis</b> and to pledge such receipts to its service.|$|E

It was a frog peeping {{out from a}} graceful tangle of grass-sprays and rushes, and was done in enamels on a <b>gold</b> <b>basis,</b> and had a gold pin back of it. After I had petted it, and played with it, and caressed it, and enjoyed {{it a couple of}} hours, the light {{happened}} to fall upon it at a new angle, and revealed to me a cunning new detail; with the light just right, certain delicate shadings of the grass-blades and rush-stems wove themselves into a monogram--mine! You can see that that jewel was a work of art. And when you come to consider the intrinsic value of it, you must concede that it is not every literary club that could afford a badge like that. It was easily worth $75, in the opinion of Messrs. Marcus and Ward of New York. They said they could not duplicate it for that and make a profit. By this time the Club was well under way; and from that time forth its secretary kept my off-hours well supplied with business. He reported the Club's discussions of my books with laborious fullness, and did his work with great spirit and ability. As a, rule, he synopsized; but when a speech was especially brilliant, he short-handed it and gave me the best passages from it, written out. There were five speakers whom he particularly favored in that way: Palmer, Forbes, Naylor, Norris, and Calder. Palmer and Forbes could never get through a speech without attacking each other, and each in his own way was formidably effective--Palmer in virile and eloquent abuse, Forbes in courtly and elegant but scalding satire. I could always tell which of them was talking without looking for his name. Naylor had a polished style and a happy knack at felicitous metaphor; Norris's style was wholly without ornament, but enviably compact, lucid, and strong. But after all, Calder was the gem. He never spoke when sober, he spoke continuously when he wasn't. And certainly they were the drunkest speeches that a man ever uttered. They were full of good things, but so incredibly mixed up and wandering that it made one's head swim to follow him. They were not intended to be funny, but they were,--funny for the very gravity which the speaker put into his flowing miracles of incongruity. In the course of five years I came to know the styles of the five orators as well as I knew the style of any speaker in my own club at home.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the political economy}} of exchange rate policy-making from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. It argues that conventional means of understanding this subject are problematic, and it develops an alternative framework for analysis based on a Marxist methodology. From this perspective exchange rate policymaking is understood to be a component part of a wider governing strategy that is made by the core executive with a view to regulating class struggle, to providing favourable conditions for capital expansion, and for ensuring a sufficient degree of freedom for the pursuit of high political goals. This theoretical framework is applied empirically through an examination of Britain’s return to the gold standard in 1925. In contrast to conventional explanations for this policy decision it is argued that the return to gold was the central component of a governing strategy designed to address long-term economic and political difficulties in the British state through the imposition of financial discipline and the ‘depoliticisation’ of economic policy-making. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional assessments of the policy as having been a disaster, it is also argued that the return to gold was a relative success. Though failing to resolve Britain’s economic difficulties, the policy was generally successful in containing class unrest and in enabling the core executive to displace pressures over economic conditions and policy-making away from the state. The substantiation given to the alternative theoretical view of exchange rate policymaking by these empirical claims is also supported by an examination of the policy regime developed {{after the collapse of the}} gold standard, and by a brief examination of Britain’s membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism from 1990 - 1992, which is shown to have direct parallels with the return to <b>gold.</b> On this <b>basis,</b> the thesis offers a firm foundation for drawing wider generalisations about {{the political economy of}} exchange rate policy-making in terms of an alternative Marxist perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of thymine on gold electrodes {{has been}} studied by ATR-SEIRAS in situ spectroscopy at three pH values (1, 7 and 12), in order to analyse the tautomeric equilibrium of deprotonated thymine in the adsorbed state. The anionic form which is deprotonated in nitrogen N 1 (N 1 tautomer) and the one deprotonated in nitrogen N 3 (N 3 tautomer) are considered. The spectroscopic results have been interpreted {{in the light of}} DFT ab-initio calculations of both tautomeric forms adsorbed on <b>gold</b> surfaces. The <b>basis</b> sets 6 - 311 + +G(d,p) for C, H, O and N atoms and LANDL 2 DZ for Au atoms have been used. The electrode surface has been simulated as an unreconstructed Au(111) surface of 19 atoms. The preponderance of each tautomer of adsorbed thymine as a function of pH has been inferred from the analysis of the spectral signals in the 1500 – 1800 cm− 1 wavenumber region related mostly to stretching modes of the carbonyl groups. It has been found that the adsorbed N 3 tautomer predominates in the case of adsorption from acid media while the N 1 tautomer predominates in the adsorption from basic media but the adsorption of both forms have been distinguished in the experiments from neutral media. Moreover, the plausible changes in the orientation of the two adsorbed tautomers with the electric field have been determined by analysing the relative intensities of the characteristic CH stretching signals in the 2800 – 3300 cm− 1 spectral region. It is proposed that the N 3 tautomer undergoes changes in the interaction sites with the metal and in the molecular plane orientation on the electrode as the electric potential is increased, but the N 1 tautomer molecule keeps the interaction sites while the molecular plane slightly rotates to facilitate the electrostatic interaction with the field.

40|$|Human {{interaction}} with gold {{can be traced}} far back in history, and throughout history, the metal has been both worshipped and fought for. People almost intuitively place {{a high value on}} this yellow metal and gold has always had a special place in the human heart. Nonetheless, the question many irresolute investors seek the answer to today is whether gold deserves a special place in their investment portfolios. The main purpose of this quantitative study was to determine whether gold is an appropriate diversifier for Swedish investors, and to find the optimal weight of gold in a Swedish equity portfolio. Corresponding properties of other precious metals silver and platinum were also investigated for comparative purposes. One of the reasons for augmented interest in investing in gold is the perceived risk in the economy. The theoretical framework for the study was Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The insight of MPT is that efficient diversification handles the risk better than individual assets. Risk management is especially crucial in an era of heightened economic, financial and political uncertainty as today. At the same time, rising correlation among traditional diversifiers make diversification more difficult. Gold, influenced by its history as a currency, has often taken the role as an inflation hedge and a portfolio stabilizer during turbulent financial markets. Inflation hedge assets like gold should be negatively correlated with the market and should give the best diversification benefits in a portfolio. This indicates that gold may be an appropriate diversifier in an equity portfolio. The study took the perspective of Swedish investors, and a Swedish equity index was therefore used as proxy for a well-diversified portfolio. Registry data for past prices of assets over a period of 47 years were obtained via a study published on the official website of the Swedish central bank and Thomson Reuters Datastream. Excess returns were then calculated and processed to obtain descriptive and inferential statistics. The optimal weights of gold and the other precious metals in an investment portfolio were calculated under the optimization framework of maximization of the Sharpe ratio where reward to volatility is highest. The calculations were performed for eight different holding periods. Results show near 0, or weak positive correlations between Swedish domestic equity and gold during the examined periods. On stand-alone <b>basis,</b> <b>gold</b> is superior to other precious metals in most of the studied periods, but all three precious metals have potential to function as diversifiers in an investment portfolio that is only devoted to Swedish domestic equities. Therefore, weightings of 9 % gold, 12 % silver and 9 % platinum are preferred to improve the performance of the Swedish equity portfolio. However, the Sharpe ratio {{does not take into account}} the ethics of investing and possible environmental and social consequences. Therefore, the suggested allocation of gold in this study may not be a sustainable investment at long term. ...|$|R
