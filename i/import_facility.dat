25|$|The US LNG {{industry}} restarted in 1965 when {{a series}} of new plants {{were built in the}} U.S. The building continued through the 1970s. These plants were not only used for peak-shaving, as in Cleveland, but also for base-load supplies for places that never had natural gas prior to this. A number of <b>import</b> <b>facilities</b> were built on the East Coast in anticipation of the need to import energy via LNG. However, a recent boom in U.S. natural gas production (2010-2014), enabled by hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), has many of these <b>import</b> <b>facilities</b> being considered as export facilities. The first U.S. LNG export was completed in early 2016.|$|R
5000|$|As fuel imports into Great Britain {{increased}} {{it became}} {{more difficult for the}} existing road and rail network to meet the demand to transfer the fuel eastwards and southwards from the west coast ports, the east coast fuel <b>import</b> <b>facilities</b> were closed because of the bombing. In April 1941 the go ahead was given for the construction of an oil pipeline from Avonmouth, where a large number of new protected storage tanks had been constructed, to the Thames (A/T pipeline). Concern as to the vulnerability of the fuel <b>import</b> <b>facilities,</b> led to the construction in 1942 of a pipeline linking the <b>import</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Stanlow area with those at Avonmouth. [...] This was followed by the construction of a pipeline running from off the A/T pipeline to the Southampton area for the stockpiling of fuel for the possible second front (R/H pipeline). During 1943 an entire ring-main linking the Mersey, the Avonmouth area, the Thames and up to the Humber area, was constructed. This was later extended into East Anglia to supply both the RAF and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).|$|R

A consensus among both policy makers and much of the domestic petroleum industry led to an accelerated programme to construct <b>facilities</b> to <b>import</b> liquefied natural gas (LNG).
