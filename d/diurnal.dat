5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some <b>diurnal</b> lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many <b>diurnal</b> species studied thus far, whereas <b>diurnal</b> anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among <b>diurnal</b> species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of <b>diurnal</b> lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
5|$|Aryabhata's {{followers}} {{were particularly}} strong in South India, where his {{principles of the}} <b>diurnal</b> rotation of Earth, among others, were followed {{and a number of}} secondary works were based on them.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Archaeopteryx and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{indicate that it}} may have been <b>diurnal,</b> similar to most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Falconidae is {{a family}} of <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, notably the falcons and caracaras. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.|$|E

5|$|Some desert {{animals are}} <b>diurnal,</b> or {{primarily}} active during the day. These include ground squirrels, marmots, chipmunks, lizards, snakes, hawks, and eagles.|$|E
5|$|The Falconidae is {{a family}} of <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey {{containing}} the falcons and caracaras. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most moths, {{the sunset}} moth is day flying {{and the bright}} aposematic colours warn predators of its toxicity, a {{strategy}} seen in many <b>diurnal</b> moths.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of a}} <b>diurnal</b> fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are <b>diurnal.</b> The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are <b>diurnal.</b> Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered <b>diurnal,</b> with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diurnal</b> {{birds of}} prey such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) are their most {{significant}} predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and the narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, Tycho Brahe {{measured}} the <b>diurnal</b> parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler {{used to make}} a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet. When the telescope became available, the <b>diurnal</b> parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments. The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of October 13, 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg. In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
5|$|Falconidae is {{a family}} of <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, notably the falcons and caracaras. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. In Tasmania, four species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Falconidae is {{a family}} of <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. In Ancient Egyptian only one species is {{depicted}} as breeding in the Delta and called HrT (meaning unknown).|$|E
5|$|Most {{birds are}} <b>diurnal,</b> but some birds, such as {{many species of}} owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during {{twilight}} hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is <b>diurnal</b> (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary by nature, the {{four-horned antelope}} may form loose {{groups of three}} to five. Groups consist {{of one or more}} adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is large, gregarious, and <b>diurnal.</b> Early travellers' reports {{describe}} noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats, but little scientific information was {{available on the}} species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s. Concern over this endangered species has since generated a body of research.|$|E
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is <b>diurnal</b> and semi-{{terrestrial}}. It {{is the most}} terrestrial of lemur species, spending as much as 33% of its time on the ground. However it is still considerably arboreal, spending 23% of its time in the mid-level canopy, 25% in the upper-level canopy, 6% in the emergent layer and 13% in small bushes. Troop travel is 70% terrestrial.|$|E
5|$|They are <b>diurnal,</b> {{preferring to}} hunt during the day, {{particularly}} {{in the early morning}} and mid to late afternoon, and will occasionally hunt in pairs. Their hunting patterns, outside breeding periods and periods of abundant prey, have distinct crepuscular peaks, perhaps corresponding to mouse activity.|$|E
5|$|They {{are likely}} to be found in valley regions that exhibit <b>diurnal</b> {{mountain}} wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} mainly <b>diurnal,</b> {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it has been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein (Afrikaans: {{uncertain}} spring), officially {{known as}} ǀUi-ǁAis (Damara/Nama: jumping waterhole), is {{a site of}} ancient rock engravings in the Kunene Region of north-western Namibia. It consists of a spring in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table mountain that receives very little rainfall and has {{a wide range of}} <b>diurnal</b> temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} {{columns in}} search of food. They forage into buildings, eucalyptus trees, ground areas or on low vegetation. Workers are both <b>diurnal</b> and nocturnal, {{but they are not}} active throughout any 24-hour period. Low activity occurs during clear sunny days; however, colonies are extremely active shortly after rain.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike <b>diurnal</b> birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs are <b>diurnal</b> (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although {{it has been suggested that}} most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, Juravenator, and Megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian Agilisaurus was inferred to be <b>diurnal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emus are <b>diurnal</b> {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E
5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large <b>diurnal</b> variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is <b>diurnal</b> and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, <b>diurnal</b> lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are <b>diurnal</b> during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} <b>diurnal</b> or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are <b>diurnal,</b> {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|E
5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the <b>diurnal</b> adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
