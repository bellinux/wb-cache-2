5|$|There is an {{association}} between the blood levels of <b>homocysteine</b> and thrombosis, although {{this has not been}} reported consistently in all studies. <b>Homocysteine</b> levels are determined by mutations in the MTHFR and CBS genes, but also by levels of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, which depend on diet.|$|E
5|$|Nonstandard {{amino acids}} are usually formed through {{modifications}} to standard amino acids. For example, <b>homocysteine</b> is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{metformin}} {{has been}} associated with increased <b>homocysteine</b> levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |authors=Wulffele MG, Kooy A, Lehert P, Bets D, Ogterop JC, Borger van der Burg B, Donker AJ, Stehouwer CD |volume=254 |issue=5 |pages=455–63|pmid=14535967 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01213.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118889232/HTMLSTART}} and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal <b>homocysteine</b> levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated risk factors for vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated <b>homocysteine</b> levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to {{increase the risk of}} vertebral artery dissection. People with an aneurysm of the aortic root and people with a history of migraine may be predisposed to vertebral artery dissection.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{scientists}} have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year. More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia are on the market today. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, <b>homocysteine</b> (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy). Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), , manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements. Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world. Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.|$|E
25|$|Concentrations {{of blood}} plasma folate and <b>homocysteine</b> {{concentrations}} are inversely related, such that {{an increase in}} dietary folate decreases <b>homocysteine</b> concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is {{a major determinant of}} <b>homocysteine</b> levels within the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} Juice Plus on {{blood levels of}} <b>homocysteine</b> have been {{reported}} in five studies, all conducted in subjects with normal <b>homocysteine</b> levels (15 μmol/L). An initial study, which was not double-blind nor placebo-controlled, reported a 37% decrease in <b>homocysteine</b> levels in subjects taking Juice Plus. More rigorous studies, including three that were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, found that <b>homocysteine</b> levels were not reduced or were reduced to a much lesser extent than originally reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{link between}} levels of folate and altered mental {{function}} is not large, but is sufficient enough {{to suggest a}} causal association. Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of <b>homocysteine</b> within the blood, as the clearance of <b>homocysteine</b> requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, {{and to a lesser}} extent, vitamins B6 and B12. Elevated <b>homocysteine</b> has been associated with increased risk of vascular events, as well as dementia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homocysteine</b> can be {{converted}} to cysteine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homocysteine,</b> a toxic 'natural' {{amino acid}} {{linked to the}} cause of heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{adequate}} folate may produce {{a form of}} dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study {{of men and women}} aged 50–70 years with elevated <b>homocysteine</b> plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in <b>homocysteine</b> levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed, which suggests there is a link between <b>homocysteine</b> and cognitive performance.|$|E
25|$|N-acetylserotonin is {{methylated}} at the hydroxyl {{position by}} S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to produce S-adenosyl <b>homocysteine</b> (SAH) and melatonin.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 is a co-substrate {{of various}} cell {{reactions}} involved in methylation synthesis of nucleic acid and neurotransmitters. Synthesis of the trimonoamine neurotransmitters {{can enhance the}} effects of a traditional antidepressant. The intracellular concentrations of vitamin B12 can be inferred through the total plasma concentration of <b>homocysteine,</b> which can be converted to methionine through an enzymatic reaction that uses 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor group. Consequently, the plasma concentration of <b>homocysteine</b> falls as the intracellular concentration of vitamin B12 rises. The active metabolite of vitamin B12 is required for the methylation of <b>homocysteine</b> in the production of methionine, which is involved in a number of biochemical processes including the monoamine neurotransmitters metabolism. Thus, a deficiency in vitamin B12 may impact the production and function of those neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} that in {{children}} with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of <b>homocysteine</b> is higher {{and the level of}} endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered <b>homocysteine</b> to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.|$|E
25|$|Methionine can be {{regenerated}} from <b>homocysteine</b> via (4) methionine synthase in {{a reaction}} that requires Vitamin B12 as a cofactor.|$|E
25|$|Down {{syndrome}} {{is a medical}} condition characterized by an overexpression of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and {{a low level of}} <b>homocysteine</b> in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Hyperhomocysteinemia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterized by an abnormally large level of <b>homocysteine</b> in the blood. Mutations in CBS are the single {{most common cause of}} hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. Genetic defects that affect the MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR/MS enzyme pathways can also contribute to high <b>homocysteine</b> levels. Inborn errors in CBS result in hyperhomocysteinemia with complications in the cardiovascular system leading to early and aggressive arterial disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia also affects three other major organ systems including the ocular, central nervous, and skeletal.|$|E
25|$|If <b>homocysteine</b> is {{produced}} the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known, one cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one independent.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the cell}} types {{targeted}} for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated <b>homocysteine</b> levels causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of <b>homocysteine</b> inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects gene that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, {{all of which are}} critical in forming atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of <b>homocysteine</b> also result in hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene, causing its down regulation. ERα protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state. Hypermethylation of the ERα promoter thus allows intimal smooth muscle cells to proliferate excessively and {{contribute to the development of}} the atherosclerotic lesion.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{has other}} {{cardiovascular}} effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital {{are associated with}} elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after methionine loading) of <b>homocysteine,</b> an amino acid derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of <b>homocysteine</b> {{have been linked to}} coronary heart disease. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A and B.|$|E
25|$|CBS enzyme {{activity}} is {{not found in}} all tissues and cells. It is absent from heart, lung, testes, adrenal, and spleen in rats. In humans, {{it has been shown}} to be absent in heart muscle and primary cultures of human aortic endothelial cells. The lack of CBS in these tissues implies that these tissues are unable to synthesize cysteine and that cysteine must be supplied from extracellular sources. It also suggests that these tissues might have increased sensitivity to <b>homocysteine</b> toxicity because they cannot catabolize excess <b>homocysteine</b> via transsulfuration.|$|E
25|$|Nutrition, {{specifically}} the Mediterranean-style diet, {{has the potential}} for decreasing the risk of having a stroke by more than half. It does not appear that lowering levels of <b>homocysteine</b> with folic acid affects the risk of stroke.|$|E
25|$|Methionine and folate {{are known}} to {{interact}} with choline while <b>homocysteine</b> is undergoing methylation to produce methionine. Recent {{studies have shown that}} choline deficiency may have adverse effects, even when sufficient amounts of methionine and folate are present.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{alternate}} reactions involving CBS is the condensation of cysteine with <b>homocysteine</b> to form cystathionine and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S {{in the brain}} is produced from L-cysteine by CBS. This alternative metabolic pathway is also dependent on adoMet.|$|E
25|$|CBS {{occupies}} a pivotal position in mammalian sulfur metabolism at the <b>homocysteine</b> junction where {{the decision to}} conserve methionine or to convert it to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway, is made. Moreover, the transsulfuration pathway is the only pathway capable of removing sulfur-containing amino acids under conditions of excess.|$|E
25|$|Choline {{deficiency}} {{may play}} a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders. One sign of choline deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT. If low choline intake causes an elevated <b>homocysteine</b> level, it raises the risk for preeclampsia, premature birth, and very low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{transfer}} of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the <b>homocysteine</b> leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} for {{an association between}} cognitive decline, <b>homocysteine</b> (Hcy) status, and vitamin B status relating especially to B12 and also to vitamins B6 and B9. In particular, deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or of folate can cause an increase in Hcy plasma levels, which in turn leads to toxic effects on the vascular and nervous systems.|$|E
25|$|To begin with, {{methionine}} can {{be formed}} two ways, either from methyl groups derived from folate, or from methyl groups derived from betaine (which gets its methyl groups from choline). Changes {{in one of}} these pathways is compensated for by the other, and if these pathways do not adequately supply methyl groups to produce methionine, the precursor to methionine, <b>homocysteine,</b> rises.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine is {{similarly}} produced, namely {{it can be}} made from an activated serine and either from <b>homocysteine</b> ("reverse trans-sulfurylation route") or from hydrogen sulfide ("direct sulfurylation route"); the activated serine is generally O-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix and some other archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effects of Juice Plus capsules on biochemical parameters associated with cardiovascular function, again with conflicting results. In October 2009, Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, Chair and Chief of Integrative Medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, noted that the results of Juice Plus studies on plasma <b>homocysteine</b> levels were not reproducible, and that studies on cardiovascular effects, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} other β-replacement enzymes, the {{reaction}} catalyzed by CBS {{is predicted to}} involve a series of adoMet-bound intermediates. Addition of serine results in a transchiffization reaction, which forms of an external aldimine. The aldimine undergoes proton abstraction at the α-carbon followed by elimination to generate an amino-acrylate intermediate. Nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of <b>homocysteine</b> on the aminoacrylate and reprotonation at Cα generate the external aldimine of cystathionine. A final transaldimination reaction releases the final product, cystathionine. The final product, L-cystathionine can also form an aminoacrylate intermediate, indicating that the entire reaction of CBS is reversible.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, folic acid {{has begun to}} be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate {{deficiency}} is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for anemia and erythrocyte size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the MTR-dependent effects of B12 deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of <b>homocysteine</b> in the blood and urine (homocysteinuria). This condition may result in long term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12-dependent MTR {{reactions}} {{may also}} have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate methionine (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, {{if it is not}} regenerated from <b>homocysteine</b> by a B12 dependent reaction) is needed to make S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of myelin sheath phospholipids. Although production of SAMe is not B12 dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the essential amino acid methionine) is assisted by B12. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B12 deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.|$|E
25|$|While folate is most {{well known}} for {{preventing}} neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Both choline and folate (with the help of vitamin B12) can act as methyl donors to <b>homocysteine</b> to form methionine, which can {{then go on to}} form SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary choline deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and choline are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production. Inhibition of choline absorption and use is associated with neural-tube defects in mice, and this may also occur in humans. A retrospective case control study (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily choline intake had a four-fold greater risk of having a child with a neural-tube defect than women in the highest quartile of intake.|$|E
