40|$|An {{intensive}} two day workshop convened {{three teams}} each {{made up of}} leading footwear designers, NHS foot clinicians and a design partner - a woman living with RA - in order to brainstorm breakthrough concepts for footwear. Their brief was to design an innovative ‘social occasion’ shoe for women that could accommodate foot damage associated with RA, be perceived as attractive and fashionable by wearers, and be suitable for mass production. The workshop aimed {{to raise awareness of}} key issues among shoe designers, manufacturers and clinical practitioners, to enable the design and provision of footwear for mobility, comfort and style, in both prescription and mainstream contexts. The challenge of the brief created a unique focus for the exchange of expertise between medicine and fashion, including the everyday experiences of marginalised shoe wearers. A large volume of experimental design material was created, along with digital documentation of final outcomes produced by each team. Several original shoe concepts were developed, which integrated e. g: modular forms and components, additional capacity for orthotics and shock absorption, experimental use of materials and construction for <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> and removing, fastening mechanisms, heel adaptations, decorative and visual styling concepts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Evaluate a new {{progressive}} {{concept of}} compression stockings {{in comparison with}} degressive compression stockings class 2 in patients with mild venous insufficiency without permanent oedema (class 1 of Porter's classification or C 0 s-C 1 s-C 2 s CEAP's classification). METHODS: The aim of this randomised, double-blind french, multicenter trial was to compare the efficacy and convenience of the new ES compared to conventional ES in patients with mild venous insufficiency for whom elastic compression by knee stockings was indicated. The primary endpoint was leg heaviness after 15 days of wearing ES. Secondary endpoints were discomfort and compliance. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were included (progressive ES: 64; conventional ES: 66). Mean age was 43 years, 68 % were women. Disappearance or major improvement of leg heaviness was observed in 73 % of patients wearing progressive ES and 62. 5 % of those wearing conventional ES (difference = - 10. 5 % [95 % CI - 26. 7; + 5. 6]). This result met pre-specified statistical criteria for non-inferiority and was confirmed by per-protocol analysis. <b>Ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> ES and comfort were significantly better with progressive ES (p< 0. 0001), as was compliance (p= 0. 016). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The Booster study is the first randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial evaluating a new concept of compression in mild venous insufficiency. The progressive ES is as efficient as degressive ES but it observance is better. This promising new concept deserves to be evaluated in other settings...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the full range}} of self-adhesive continence sheaths for men available in the UK and thus provide clinicians and consumers with a basis for product selection. Subjects and methods Fifty-eight volunteers (aged 30 - 89 years) tested each of six different self-adhesive sheaths available in the UK in September 1998 for 1 week each. Thirty subjects applied the sheaths themselves and 28 subjects relied on a carer to do so. During each week subjects completed a diary recording sheath changes and the result of skin inspection, to note any unscheduled sheath changes (because of sheath detachment) and any skin problems. At the end of each week an 11 -item questionnaire was completed using a three-point rating scale (9 ̆ 1 good 9 ̆ 2, 9 ̆ 1 acceptable 9 ̆ 2, 9 ̆ 1 unacceptable 9 ̆ 2) to assess the key aspects of product performance. Results A significantly higher proportion of subjects scored the 9 ̆ 1 Aquadry Clear Advantage 9 ̆ 2 sheath as 9 ̆ 1 good 9 ̆ 2 than four of the other sheaths (P < 0. 01) and a significantly higher proportion found the 9 ̆ 1 Incare 9 ̆ 2 sheath to be 9 ̆ 1 unacceptable 9 ̆ 2 than all of the other sheaths (P < 0. 001) for the 9 ̆ 1 overall opinion 9 ̆ 2 question. Sheath detachments (sheath falling off or blowing off) for the 9 ̆ 1 Incare 9 ̆ 2 were significantly more common than for four of the other products (P < 0. 01). Sheath detachments for the 9 ̆ 1 Aquadry Clear Advantage 9 ̆ 2 were significantly less common than for two of the other products (P < 0. 01). A significantly higher proportion of subjects found sheaths with an applicator to be 9 ̆ 1 unacceptable 9 ̆ 2 than sheaths with no applicator (P < 0. 001) for the 9 ̆ 1 <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 9 ̆ 2 and 9 ̆ 1 overall opinion 9 ̆ 2 questions (when adjusted for previous product use and person applying the sheath). Conclusions There were substantial differences between products in their general performance and ergonomics, and for the frequency of detachment as recorded in the diary. The 9 ̆ 1 Aquadry Clear Advantage 9 ̆ 2 was particularly successful and the 9 ̆ 1 Incare 9 ̆ 2 particularly unsuccessful when compared with the other sheaths. Sheaths with no applicators were preferred to those with applicators. Applicators are mainly designed to make sheaths easier to put on, especially for carers, but {{there was no evidence that}} carers preferred applicators. This may have implications for manufacturers...|$|E

40|$|Background: The UK health service, {{nursing homes}} and public spend around £ 94 million per year on {{incontinence}} pads (absorbent products) to contain urine and/or faeces, but the research base for making informed choices between different product designs is very weak. Objectives: The aim of this trial was to compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of the key absorbent product designs {{to provide a more}} solid basis for guiding selection and purchase. A further aim was to carry out the first stage {{in the development of a}} quality of life instrument for measuring the impact of absorbent product use on users' lives. Design: The work involved three clinical trials focusing on the three biggest market sectors. Each trial had a similar crossover design in which each participant tested all products within their group in random order. Settings, participants and methods: In Trial 1, 85 women with light urinary incontinence living in the community tested three products from each of the four design categories available (total of 12 test products) : disposable inserts (pads); menstrual pads; washable pants with integral pad; and washable inserts. In Trial 2 a, 85 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in the community (49 men and 36 women) tested three (or two) products from each of the five design categories available (total of 14 test products) : disposable inserts (with mesh pants); disposable diapers (nappies); disposable pull-ups (similar to toddlers' trainer pants); disposable T-shaped diapers (nappies with waist-band); and washable diapers. All products were provided in a daytime and a (mostly more absorbent) night-time variant. In these first two trials, the test products were selected on the basis of data from pilot studies. In Trial 2 b, 100 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in 10 nursing homes (27 men and 73 women) evaluated one product from each of the four disposable design categories from Trial 2 a. Products were selected on the basis of product performance in Trial 2 a and, again, daytime and night-time variants were provided. The first phase of work to develop a quality of life tool for measuring the impact of using different pad designs was carried out by interviewing participants from Trials 1 and 2 a. Outcome measures: Product performance was characterised using validated questionnaires, which asked the participants (in Trials 1 and 2 a) or carers (all participants in Trial 2 b, except for the few who could report for themselves) to evaluate various aspects of pad performance (leakage, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on,</b> discreetness, etc.) using a five-point scale (very good–very poor) at the end of the week (or 2 weeks for Trial 2 b) of product testing. In addition, participants/carers were asked to save individual used pads in bags for weighing and to indicate the severity of any leakage from them on a three-point scale (none, a little, a lot). These data were used to determine differences in leakage performance. Numbers of laundry items and pads used were recorded to estimate costs, and skin health changes were recorded by the participant or by the researchers (Trial 2 b). At the end of testing, participants were interviewed and ranked their preferences (with and without costs), stated the acceptability of each design (highly acceptable–totally unacceptable) and recorded their overall opinion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 – 100 points (worst design–best design). This VAS score was used with product costs to estimate cost-effectiveness. In addition, a timed pad changing exercise was conducted with 10 women from Trial 2 b to determine any differences between product designs. Results: Results presented are for statistically and clinically significant findings. <br/...|$|E

Principally, it discusses the conflicts that occurred between the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the initial requirements on paper and the difficulty in applying them. The requirements were not formally specified, but the process of turning them into code followed our standard software development process. However, the informality of the requirements was not the primary source of our conflicts; we believe that ambiguity always exists, ambiguity leads to assumptions, and assumptions are what lead to flaws – some of which may cause security vulnerabilities. By explaining our journey through the software development process, we show how seemingly obvious and easily stated requirements lead to ambiguity, choices, and the need for revisiting specifications throughout the process. We conclude with some recommendations from our experiences that we hope will be useful to other practitioners. 1...|$|R
