Nanoparticle monolayers at the air–water {{interface}} {{have received}} broad attention {{because of their}} potential applications owing to the tunability of their surface properties. We prepared gold nanoparticle monolayers by adsorption of hydrophilized nanoparticles from solution onto Langmuir monolayers of amphiphilic organic molecules (polyion complexes of deuterated stearic acid and polyallylamine) at the air–water interface, followed by adsorption of <b>dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> onto the underside of these particles. The infrared external reflection spectra of the monolayers recorded both during and after preparation showed that the adsorption of gold nanoparticles on the Langmuir monolayers and that of <b>dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> on the nanoparticles occurred in several tens of minutes. The infrared spectra also showed that both stearic acid and <b>dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> molecules were highly ordered on the gold nanoparticles at the air–water interface. These results suggested that this preparation procedure is a useful fabrication method for Janus particles...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interaction}} of benzyltrimethyl- and <b>dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> and chlori-des with red blood cells and planar lipid membranes. The aim of the work was to find whether counterion type influences that interaction. The model membranes were pig erythrocytes and planar lipid membranes (BLM). A change of mechanical properties of these membranes was observed {{in the presence of}} the compounds studied. The measured parameters were a degree of hemolysis of erythrocytes and stability of BLM's. The critical concentration of a compound was the measure of BLM stability. The lifetime of BLMs under such concentrations of a compound did not exceed 3 min. It was found in each case that bromides influenced model membranes slightly stronger than the corresponding chlorides. A possible explanation of the results obtained is presented. Namely, it seems that the greater efficiency of bromides to destabilize model membranes in comparison with chlorides can be attributed to greater mobility and smaller radius of the hydrated bromide ion. This can be the reason why bromide anions modify surface potential of model membranes more efficiently, which in turn leads to more intensive interaction of bromides with such modified bilayer in comparison to their analog chlorides...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of ionic micelles {{are affected by}} the nature of the counterion. Specific ion effects can be dramatic, inducing even shape and phase changes in micellar solns., transitions apparently related to micellar hydration and counterion binding at the micellar interface. Thus, detg. the hydration and dynamics of ions in micellar systems capable of undergoing such transitions is a crucial step in understanding shape and phase changes. For cationic micelles, such transitions are common with large org. anions as counterions. However, phase sepn. also occurs for dodecyltrimethylammonium triflate (DTATf) micelles in the presence of Na triflate (NaTf). Specific ion effects for micellar solns. of <b>dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> chloride (DTAC), <b>bromide</b> (DTAB), methanesulfonate (DTAMs), and triflate (DTATf) were studied with dielec. relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), a technique capable of monitoring hydration and counterion dynamics of micellar aggregates. In comparison to DTAB, DTAC, and DTAMs, DTATf micelles are considerably less hydrated and showed reduced counterion mobility at the micellar interface. The obtained DTATf and DTAMs data support the reported central role of the anion's -CF 3 moiety with respect to the {{properties of}} DTATf micelles. The reduced hydration obsd. for DTATf micelles was rationalized in terms of the higher packing of this surfactant compared to that of other DTA-based systems. The decreased mobility of Tf- anions condensed at the DTATf interface strongly suggests the insertion of Tf- in the micellar interface, which is apparently driven by the strong hydrophobicity of -CF 3...|$|R
40|$|Specific ion {{effects in}} {{surfactant}} solutions affect {{the properties of}} micelles. <b>Dodecyltrimethylammonium</b> chloride (DTAC), <b>bromide</b> (DTAB), and methanesulfonate (DTAMs) micelles are typically spherical, but some organic anions can induce shape or phase transitions in DTA(+) micelles. Above a defined concentration, sodium triflate (NaTf induces a phase separation in dodecyltrimethylammonium triflate (DTATf micelles, a phenomenon rarely observed in cationic micelles. This unexpected behavior of the DTATf/NaTf system suggests that DTATf aggregates have unusual properties. the structural properties of DTATf micelles were analyzed by time-resolved fluorescence quenching, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance and {{compared with those of}} DTAC, DTAB, and DTAMs micelles. Compared to the other micelle types, the DTATf micelles had a higher average number of monomers per aggregate, an uncommon disk-like shape, smaller interfacial hydration, and restricted monomer chain mobility. Molecular dynamic simulations supported these observations. Even small water-soluble salts can profoundly affect micellar properties; our data demonstrate that the -CF 3 group in Tf- was directly responsible for the observed shape changes by decreasing interfacial hydration and increasing the degree of order of the surfactant chains in the DTATf micelles.
