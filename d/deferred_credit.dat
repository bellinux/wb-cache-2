40|$|Enterprises issue credit cards, debit cards, {{bank charge}} cards, {{and other similar}} cards (collectively, credit cards) {{with a variety of}} terms. An issuer may charge an {{origination}} fee in connection with the issuance of a credit card and periodic renewal fees for the continued extension of credit card privileges. As part of a promotion to attract new cardholders or retain existing cardholders, some of those issuers may waive the payment of credit card fees for the initial use period or in some cases for a longer period. Other enterprises issue credit cards that do not require the payment of any fees {{for the use of the}} credit card. In connection with the issuance of a credit card, an issuer may incur certain credit card origination costs that qualify as direct loan origination costs pursuant to Statement 91. The issue is over what period qualifying <b>deferred</b> <b>credit</b> card origination costs should be amortized. This Issue addresses the amortization of deferred origination costs of credit cards with fees, without fees, or when the fees have been waived for a limited period of time.

40|$|We {{find that}} banks charge more for {{overdraft}} credit when depositors {{have access to}} a potential substitute: <b>deferred</b> deposit ("payday") <b>credit.</b> We attribute this rise in prices partly to adverse selection created by banks' practice of charging a flat fee regardless of the overdraft amount [...] pricing that favors depositors prone to large overdrafts. When <b>deferred</b> deposit <b>credit</b> priced per dollar borrowed is available, depositors prone to small overdrafts switch to that option. That selection works against banks; large overdrafts cost more to supply and, if depositors default, banks lose more, so prices rise. Consistent with this adverse-selection hypothesis, we document that the average dollar amount per returned check at banks and other depository institutions increases when depositors have access to <b>deferred</b> deposit <b>credit.</b> Beyond documenting another case of price-increasing competition, our findings bear on theories of adverse selection in credit markets and contribute to the debate over {{the pros and cons of}} payday credit.

5000|$|Oklahoma's $6.7 billion {{state budget}} for FY2011 was {{approved}} in May 2010 and is $400 million {{less than the}} previous budget. State revenues declined almost 17% in FY2010, down approximately $945 million from FY2009. [...] As a result, lawmakers cut state agency budgets 7.5% midway through FY2010. Then lawmakers relied {{on a combination of}} fee hikes, <b>deferred</b> tax <b>credits</b> and further cuts to state agencies (3% cut in general) to help balance the FY2011 budget. [...] That was not, however, enough and lawmakers additionally relied on $500 million in federal stimulus money and $277 million in funds from the Constitutional Reserve Fund to balance the FY2011 state budget.|$|R
40|$|Various {{health care}} {{providers}} offer patients medical credit cards that charge high rates of deferred interest. As the cost of medical care and patient responsibility for out-of-pocket costs continue to rise, patients have turned to medical credit cards for help footing the bill. Unfortunately, because they fail to pay off their balances {{before the end of}} the promotional period, many patients find themselves unexpectedly responsible for deferred interest charges at rates well above those associated with general-purpose credit cards. Medical credit cards fall outside the protection of many federal credit laws regulating consumer credit. This Note argues that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) should ban <b>deferred</b> interest medical <b>credit</b> cards through the exercise of its rulemaking power. Short of a total ban on <b>deferred</b> interest medical <b>credit</b> cards, the CFPB should use its rulemaking power to expand the reforms it recently levied on GE CareCredit to the entire medical credit card industry...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Accounting) This study {{examines}} {{the disclosure of}} taxation in company financial statements. The following aspects were discussed: (a) The taxation expense in the income statement comprises of a current tax charge and deferred tax provision. (b) The extent of {{the recognition of the}} tax effects of timing differences in company financial statements. (c) The alternative measurement methods which can be applied to either partial or full allocation. (d) The effect of tax allocation on company financial statements 1 n the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America. (e) Discounting of the <b>deferred</b> tax <b>credit.</b> (f) The development of generally accepted accounting practice ln South Africa relating to tax allocation. The discussion indicates that the South African statement with regard to the disclosure of taxation, promotes the usefulness of published financial information even though it is not free of criticism. A number of recommendations are made by which the problems currently being encountered with the South African statement on the disclosure of taxation in company financial statements, can be addressed...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between firm growth and managerial incentive provision under moral hazard when a long-lived firm is operated by a sequence of managers. In our model, firms replace their managers not only upon poor performance to provide incentives, but also when outside managers are at a comparative advantage to lead the firm through a new growth phase. We show how the optimal contract can be implemented with a system of <b>deferred</b> compensation <b>credit</b> and bonuses, along with dismissal and severance policies. Firms with better investment prospects have higher managerial turnover and rely on more front-loaded compensation schemes. Growth-induced turnover can result in positive severance if the principal needs to incentivize the manager to truthfully report {{the arrival of a}} growth opportunity. Realized firm growth depends jointly on the exogenous arrival of growth opportunities and the severity of the moral hazard problem. We also find a new component of agency costs due to the spillover effect of the tenure of the incumbent manager onto the present value of future managers’ compensation...|$|R
40|$|With {{the coming}} {{changes in the}} {{electrical}} industry, there is a broad {{need to understand the}} impacts of restructuring on customers, existing utilities, and other stakeholders. Retail wheeling; performance-based regulation; unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; and the impact of stranded commitments are all key issues in the discussions of the future of the industry. To quantify these issues, financial and production cost models are required. The authors have created a smaller and faster finance and operations model call the Oak Ridge Financial Model (ORFIN) to help analyze the ramifications of the issues identified above. It combines detailed pricing and financial analysis with an economic dispatch model over a multi-year period. Several types of ratemaking are modeled, as well as the wholesale market and retail wheeling. Multiple plants and purchased power contracts are modeled for economic dispatch, and separate financial accounts are kept for each. Transmission, distribution, and other functions are also broken out. Regulatory assets such as <b>deferred</b> tax <b>credits</b> and demand-side management (DSM) programs are also included in the income statement and balance sheet. This report describes some of the key features of the model. Examples of the financial reports are shown, with a description of their formulation. Some of the ways these results can be used in analyzing various issues are provided...|$|R
