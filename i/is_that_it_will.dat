25|$|By {{analyzing}} the polarization {{in the combined}} light of the planet and star (about one part in a million), these measurements can in principle be made with very high sensitivity, as polarimetry is not limited by {{the stability of the}} Earth's atmosphere. Another main advantage is that polarimetry allows for determination of the composition of the planet's atmosphere. The main disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be able to detect planets without atmospheres. Larger planets and planets with higher albedo are easier to detect through polarimetry, as they reflect more light.|$|E

25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E

500|$|Under Section 30(2), {{fair dealing}} using any {{work for the}} purpose of {{reporting}} current events, with sufficient acknowledgement, is a valid exception to copyright.

A crucial element of the [...] "current events" [...] exception {{is whether or not the}} reporting covers [...] "current" [...] events. [...] "The older the issue, the less likely it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be treated as having any currency". Hyde Park confirmed that, where an event that took place some time ago is still being discussed, that can be treated as [...] "current". The nature of [...] "events" [...] must also be confirmed; while some things will be inherently considered events, such as matters of national importance, major sporting contests or important political occasions, others may not be. Matters that are [...] "trivial, ephemeral or immaterial" [...] may not be treated as events, although it has been confirmed that media attention can transform a trivial matter into an [...] "event", as in Pro Sieben. The copyrighted works must also directly deal with the current events; Associated Newspapers v News Group Newspapers, for example, concerned the republication of correspondence between Wallis Simpson and her husband on the occasion of Simpson's death. It was held that the correspondence did not relate closely enough to the death for the fair dealing exception to apply.|$|E
