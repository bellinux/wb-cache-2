5000|$|The {{camera was}} {{developed}} by Harold Edgerton in the 1940s and was first used to photograph the rapidly changing matter in nuclear explosions within milliseconds of ignition, using exposures of several microseconds. To overcome the speed limitation of a conventional camera's mechanical shutter, the rapatronic camera uses two polarizing filters and a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cell</b> (or in some variants a Kerr cell). The two filters are mounted with their polarization angles at 90° to each other, to block all incoming light. The <b>Faraday</b> <b>cell</b> sits between the filters and changes the polarization plane of light passing through it depending {{on the level of}} magnetic field applied, acting as a shutter when it is energized at the right time for a very short amount of time, allowing the film to be properly exposed.|$|E
50|$|Using a SoulScan, Atwater ejects Sondra from Serena and {{releases}} Mfume, but Avebury commandeers Mfume's body again, using her to murder Atwater. Mfume manages to confine Sondra to the <b>Faraday</b> <b>cell,</b> while Atwater's soul confronts {{the soul of}} Alan Pelletier, the innocent man he accidentally killed years before. After reconciling with Pelletier, Atwater manages to find Natalie and occupy her body before skipping from her to Markham and stopping Evan from killing Natalie.|$|E

Natalie manages to manipulate Evan into nearly releasing her; her escape fails, however, when Sondra takes over Evan's body. Sondra's attempt to kill Natalie is also interrupted when Mfume draws her out of Evan and into the <b>Faraday</b> <b>cell</b> at LAPD.|$|E
40|$|For {{analytical}} applications, {{an often}} overlooked property of light is its plane of polarization. However, since life processes usually favor one enantiomeric isomer, polarization sensitive techniques {{are necessary to}} answer a variety of chemical questions. The crux of this thesis, therefore, will be to present recent advances in the measure- ment and utilization of the polarization properties of light;Since optical activity is usually an indication of biological activity, past or present, optical rotation detection (ORD) can impart a unique selectivity to the chromatographic analysis of complicated geochem- ical samples. The advantages of selective detection will be demon- strated for several coal liquids, and LC-ORD will {{be shown to be}} useful for the fingerprinting of coals as well as for following the degree of processing of a fossil fuel;A recent trend in liquid chromatography has been the develop- ment of microcolumn technology. Microcolumns can be operated at reduced cost, and frequently, with improved efficiency over con- ventional sized columns. Using selected Glan-Thompson polarizing prisms, a liquid based <b>Faraday</b> modulation <b>cell</b> and a laser source, a micropolarimeter has been constructed with a one microliter flow cell that is compatible with microcolumn chromatography. When an optically active solvent is used with the micropolarimeter, optically inactive analytes can be detected as they elute from a microcolumn. This technique, termed indirect polarimetry, has converted the very selective micropolarimeter into a sensitive universal detection scheme superior to the conventional refractive index detector. Additionally, it will be shown that indirect polarimetry can be used to detect analyte absorptions with excellent sensitivity. The theoretical and experimental considerations necessary to obtain simultaneous selective, universal and absorption information will be discussed;Finally, Raman spectra can be obtained by monitoring the polar- ization properties of a probe field while it interacts with a Raman shifted pump field. An analytical investigation of this technique, the Raman induced Kerr effect will be presented, along with a unique;optical null capable of suppressing spectral and nonresonant background interferences; *DOE Report IS-T- 1189.

40|$|Spaceborne lidar (light {{detection}} and ranging) systems {{have a large}} potential to become powerful instruments {{in the field of}} atmospheric research. Obviously, they have to be in operation for about three years without any maintenance like readjusting. Furthermore, they have to withstand strong temperature cycles typically in the range of - 30 to + 50 °C as well as mechanical shocks and vibrations, especially during launch. Additionally, the avoidance of any organic material inside the laser box is required, particularly in UV lasers. For atmospheric research pulses of about several 10 mJ at repetition rates of several 10 Hz are required in many cases. Those parameters are typically addressed by DPSSL that comprise components like: laser crystals, nonlinear crystals in pockels <b>cells,</b> <b>faraday</b> isolators and frequency converters, passive fibers, diode lasers and of course a lot of mirrors and lenses. In particular, some components have strong requirements regarding their tilt stability that is often in the 10 μrad range. In most of the cases components and packages that are used for industrial lasers do not fulfil all those requirements. Thus, the packaging of all these key components has been developed to meet those specifications only making use of metal and ceramics beside the optical component itself. All joints between the optical component and the laser baseplate are soldered or screwed. No clamps or adhesives are used. Most of the critical properties like tilting after temperature cycling have been proven in several tests. Currently, these components are used to build up first prototypes for spaceborne systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the chemical/thermal stability of the sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (sPEEK) polymer for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications at medium temperatures (up to 130 ºC), novel inorganic-organic composite membranes were prepared using sPEEK polymer as organic matrix (sulfonation degree, SD, of 42 and 68 %) modified with zirconium phosphate (ZrPh) pre-treated with n-propylamine and polybenzimidazole (PBI). The analyzed compositions were: 10 wt. % ZrPh and 5. 6 wt. % PBI; 20 wt. % ZrPh and 11. 2 wt. % PBI. These composite membranes were tested in DMFC at several temperatures by evaluating the current-voltage polarization curve, open circuit voltage (OCV) and constant voltage current (CV, 35 mV). The fuel cell ohmic resistance (null phase angle impedance, NPAI) and CO 2 concentration in the cathode outlet were also measured. A method is also proposed to evaluate the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>Faraday</b> and global efficiency considering the CH 3 OH, CO 2, H 2 O, O 2 and N 2 permeation through the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and parasitic oxidation of the crossover methanol in the cathode. In order to improve {{the analysis of the}} composite membrane properties, selected characterization results presented in [V. S. Silva, B. Ruff,ann, S. Vetter, A. Mendes, L. M. Madeira, S. P. Nunes, Catal. Todaym in press] were also used in the present study. The unmodified sPEEK membrane with SD= 42 % (S 42) was used as the reference material. In the present study, the composite membrane prepared with sPEEK SD= 68 % and inorganic composition of 20. 0 wt. %ZrPh and 11. 2 wt. %PBI proved to have a good relationship between proton conductivity, aqueous methanol swelling and permeability. DMFC tests results for this membrane showed similar current density output and higher open circuit voltage compared to that of sPEEK with SD= 42 %, but with much lower CO 2 concentration in the cathode outlet (thus higher global efficiency) and higher thermal/chemical stability. This membrane was also tested at 130 ºC with pure oxygen (cathode inlet) and achieved a maximum power density of 50. 1 mW cm - 2 at 250 mA cm - 2...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} are underway to detect vacuum birefringence and dichroism [...] PVLAS, Q & A, and BMV. Recently, PVLAS experiment has observed optical rotation in vacuum by {{a magnetic field}} (vacuum dichroism). Theoretical interpretations of this result include a possible pseudoscalar-photon interaction {{and the existence of}} millicharged fermions. Here, we report the progress and first results of Q & A (QED [quantum electrodynamics] and Axion) experiment proposed and started in 1994. A 3. 5 -m high-finesse (around 30, 000) Fabry-Perot prototype detector extendable to 7 -m has been built and tested. We use X-pendulums and automatic control schemes developed by the gravitational-wave detection community for mirror suspension and cavity control. To polarize the vacuum, we use a 2. 3 -T dipole permanent magnet, with 27 -mm-diameter clear borehole and 0. 6 -m field length,. In the experiment, the magnet is rotated at 5 - 10 rev/s to generate time-dependent polarization signal with twice the rotation frequency. Our ellipsometer/polarization-rotation-detection-system is formed by a pair of Glan-Taylor type polarizing prisms with extinction ratio lower than 10 - 8 together with a polarization modulating <b>Faraday</b> <b>Cell</b> with/without a quarter wave plate. We made an independent calibration of our apparatus by performing a measurement of gaseous Cotton-Mouton effect of nitrogen.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. During {{the period}} January 2001 to January 2003, M Sc student Mr Tleyane Jonas Sono {{developed}} an apparatus {{to measure the}} pressure- and temperature-dependence of the electro-optic Kerr effect (electric-field-induced birefringence) in gases. Mr Sono presented experimental results for dimethyl ether at a wavelength of 632. 8 nm, extracting polarizability tensor components, first and second Kerr hyperpolarizabilities, and second Kerr-effect virial coefficients for this molecular species. This thesis has been primarily concerned with a thorough re-investigation of the Keneffect for the dimethyl ether molecule. Of primary concern is the reproducibility of the measured data, which depend upon precise and accurate knowledge of various experimental parameters. These include calibrations of the high-voltage power supply {{which is used to}} establish the electric field across the medium, the pressure transducer, the platinum thermistors, as well as the <b>Faraday</b> <b>cell</b> which forms the heart of the compensator. There is also a possibility of the 316 -stainless-steel electrodes buckling and warping as they are cycled over ± 200 °C, leading to variations in the applied field and a consequent hysteresis in the results. In essence, we have been loath to publish our Kerr-effect investigation of dimethyl ether before making a thorough investigation of the reproducibility of our measured data. Here we present our investigations, and compare our new Kerr virial coefficients and the molecular (hyper) polarizability data extracted from them against the previous work of Sono. It will become apparent agreement is excellent, and that the findings for dimethyl ether are now ready for publication. The molecular-tensor theory of the Kerr-effect; including the second Kerr-effect virial coefficient BK, which describes the effects of intermolecular collisions on the molecular Kerr constant; is reviewed. The computed data is compared with the experimental data, yielding good agreement over the full experimental temperature range of 280 to 450 K. Attempts to obtain measured data at 260 K proved fruitless in the present study, though efforts are underway to complete this task...|$|E
