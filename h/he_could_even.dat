25|$|In {{a sign of}} loyalty, al-Douri {{consented to}} marry his {{daughter}} to Hussein's eldest son, Uday Hussein. Al-Douri’s influence with Hussein was so substantial that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> levy a condition, that the union would not be consummated, and later made a successful petition that his daughter be permitted to divorce Uday.|$|E
25|$|An {{absolute}} monarch since 1660, the King could ennoble and {{for that}} sake remove the noble status of anyone he wished andunlike earlierwithout approval from the Council of the Kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> elevate dead humans to the estate of nobles. For example, four days {{after his death in}} 1781, Hans Eilersen Hagerup was ennobled under the name de Gyldenpalm. This made as well his legitimate children and other patrilineal descendants noble.|$|E
25|$|Berthold {{had often}} flown a Pfalz D.III in {{preference}} to the Albatros D.V. In May 1918, the new Fokker D.VII entered service. Berthold borrowed {{one of the}} new machines from Jagdgeschwader 1 for a surrepitious test flight. He liked its lightness on the controls, remarking hopefully that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> fly it with his damaged right arm. On the morning of 28 May, he mounted a brand-new Fokker D.VII and for the first time, led his air wing into combat. Although it was a ground support mission, he took the opportunity to score his 29th victory. The following day, he downed two more enemy aircraft, despite a malfunctioning gun synchronizer that nearly shot away his own propeller and caused a crash-landing. Berthold's drug addiction did not handicap him in the air. Georg von Hantelmann, one of his pilots, noted that despite his undiminished martial skills, his morphine addiction made him temperamentally erratic. Nevertheless, his subordinates remained loyal to him.|$|E

25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> begin to match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find another place to play. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|In making Gasketball, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{felt that}} their game quality had been {{improving}} over time, though designing for a million-person audience was [...] "daunting" [...] and Wohlwend questioned whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> recreate Solipskier success. The former game was designed in fits of creativity while the latter had no such moments, and took longer to produce. They discarded [...] "everything" [...] multiple times during their prototyping process {{with the understanding that}} anything less than what they wanted would lead to a subpar end result. Boxleiter had difficulty accepting praise towards the end of development, considering the weight of having to leave the industry if the many 100-hour weeks did not pan out in an accepted product.|$|E
500|$|Buemi {{said that}} {{was looking forward to}} {{competing}} in Marrakesh but knew {{that it would not be}} easy to repeat his Hong Kong victory. He was aware of how different the two tracks were and said that it would be [...] "exciting" [...] to visit the city for the first time. His team wanted to maximise every detail feasible and could not wait to drive on the track. Mahindra driver Felix Rosenqvist stated that his target for the event was to continue the momentum his team built at the season's previous round. He wanted to extract the maximum amount possible from his car's package as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> at the cost of still learning slightly more about his vehicle. However, he was unsure whether the track's layout suited him because it required a different driving style and rhythm than in Hong Kong.|$|E

500|$|Riding the {{earnings}} from Solipskier, Mikengreg continued to pay themselves their same salary but now had {{the means to}} try new ideas. Wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six [...] "fairly polished prototypes" [...] over {{the development of their}} next game, Gasketball. They were able to live on $20–25,000 a year each in Iowa {{for the next two years}} while working on the new game. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus felt like their external pressure was low. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living off of the Solipskier funds. In making Gasketball, Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had improved continually, but found the idea of a million-person audience [...] "daunting" [...] and Wohlwend questioned whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> recreate Solipskier success. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living off of the couches of friends.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|Sumner easily won {{reelection in}} 1798 and 1799, but was ill during the 1799 race, which he {{won by a}} landslide. [...] Constitutional issues were raised because {{he was on his}} deathbed and it was {{uncertain}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> take the oath of office. [...] Sumner finally took the oath of office in early June, but died a few days later, at which point Gill became acting governor. [...] Gill served out Sumner's term, and was considered a candidate for the governorship as the 1800 election approached. [...] The election primarily pitted Federalist Caleb Strong against Democratic-Republican Elbridge Gerry, and was won by Strong. [...] Gill was derided by his opponents as the preferred candidate of the wealthy, and Federalists were accused of promoting him as a candidate in order to divide the opposition. [...] Gill died on May 20, before Strong was informed of the victory, resulting in the only time in the state's history when the offices of governor and lieutenant governor were both formally vacant. As a result, the Governor's Council ruled the state for ten days. (The council had governed several times during the colonial period under similar circumstances; the state constitution was amended in 1918 to remove the council from the gubernatorial succession.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy {{received}} {{high praise}} for {{his performance in}} a 0–0 draw with Barcelona in a UEFA Cup last-16 clash at the Camp Nou in March 2004. He was rewarded with his first Scotland call-up for a friendly against Romania on 31 March 2004. Just 14 minutes into the match, Kennedy sustained a serious injury after a [...] "late challenge" [...] on him by Ionel Ganea, which ruled him out of action for almost three years. Kennedy required several operations by Richard Steadman before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> attempt a comeback. Following his injury, the SFA compensated Celtic with respect to Kennedy's wages, {{as it had been}} suffered while he was playing in an international match.|$|E
2500|$|John Mason was {{appointed}} Secretary of Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs in 1830 by President Andrew Jackson. Young Stevens was more politically savvy {{than his father}} and helped {{to protect him from}} schemes launched by anti-Jackson forces. This gained him notice from the territorial governor, Lewis Cass. In 1831, President Jackson sent his father on a mission to Mexico and named Stevens to replace his father as Secretary, at the age of nineteen before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> vote. At about the same time, Governor Cass became Jackson’s Secretary of War. George Bryan Porter was named to replace Cass, but he was frequently absent and Mason was, for all practical purposes, the acting governor during this time, leading to his nickname of the [...] "Boy Governor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing up to 3.5 {{years in}} {{military}} prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack {{and stated that}} he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service. [...] He requested that the jury allow him to continue {{his career in the}} military ("I don't want it to end this way, I want to continue to serve"), and that he would now undertake his deployment if <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>even</b> with his concerns about the president unaddressed. [...] The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a [...] "compassionate physician" [...] who always volunteered to help when needed. [...] The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives.|$|E

2500|$|Between 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} conquests in Jiangdong and seized control of most of the territories in the region. Around 200, Cao Cao finally engaged Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. When Sun Ce heard that Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate with Yuan Shao at Guandu, he planned to lead an army across the Yangtze River and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which was Cao Cao's base. When Cao Cao's men received news of the impending assault, they were all shocked and frightened, but Guo Jia said, [...] "Sun Ce had newly conquered the lands in Jiangdong and he killed many heroes whose followers were willing to die for them. Besides, Sun Ce is overly confident and is unprepared, so even though he has thousands of troops, the situation is not much different from him setting out to conquer the Central Plains all by himself. If he encounters assassins, he'll have to deal with them alone. From what I observe, he'll eventually die {{at the hands of a}} common man." [...] Guo Jia's prediction came true as Sun Ce was assassinated by the followers of Xu Gong (a commandery administrator he killed earlier) before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> carry out his plan.|$|E
2500|$|He {{studied at}} the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico {{following}} his dismissal from the Jesuits, and excelled at mathematics and developed a lifelong interest in the sciences. When a faculty position in Mathematics & Astrology was available, Sigüenza sought to compete for it, {{although he did not}} hold a degree in the subjects. It was not clear that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> be eligible to compete, but Sigüenza argued successfully to do so. Selection for university posts was via oposiciones or competition between candidates. A question was posed and the candidate had to complete a response within 24 hours to be judged by a panel. Ghost writers or ringers sometimes completed the exercise and Sigüenza successfully argued that his chief rival for the position, and the person who vociferously argued that Sigüenza had no standing to even compete, had to be kept under surveillance during the competition to prevent cheating. On July 20, 1672, he was named to the chair of Mathematics and Astrology. His record as a professor was marred because he was frequently absent from the classroom due his researches on various topics and to the press of other obligations he took on for fiscal reasons. One of his biographers suggests that his absences from the university might be attributable to his disdain for astrology, which he considered [...] "a diabolical invention and consequently, alien to science, method, principle and truth." ...|$|E
