40|$|Background: Disease {{management}} {{has been shown}} to improve outcomes in patients with chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Yet Independent Practice Associations (IPA) have expressed concern with the promise of disease management (DM) to improve patient outcomes. Managed care initiatives promote the use of case management, DM, and the use of practice guidelines. However, some physicians think that this may impinge on their autonomy. Objective: To demonstrate that integration of an independent DM company in conjunction with an IPA enhances compliance with guideline-recommended medications, reduces morbidity and improves quality of life in patients with CAD. Design: IPA physicians and an independent DM company were contracted with a health plan to provide care to patients with current or recent CAD. The DM company facilitated physician-ordered guideline implementations, provided member education, facilitated medication compliance, and collected all data, using a decision support software system. Collected data included: hospital utilization, quality of life, and reported medications and associated compliance rates. Setting: A large IPA group in the Midwest region of the US. Study Participants: Sixty-five <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> who were active in the DM program as of April 2, 2002 and in the program for at least 180 days were included in the analysis. Results: The average age of the patients was 73. 4 years and 54 % were male. The mean duration in the DM program was 10 months (median = 7 months). For those patients (n = 54) with baseline and follow-up mental and physical quality-of-life (QOL) scores, mental QOL scores increased by 2. 6 % (not significant) and physical QOL scores increased by 11 % (pAntihyperlipidaemics, Antiplatelets, Beta adrenoceptor antagonists, Coronary disorders, Disease management programmes, Guideline utilisation, Pharmacoeconomics, Quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the universal application of myocardial scanning with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) would result in better risk stratification in renal transplant candidates (RTC) compared with SPECT being restricted to patients who, in addition to renal disease, had other clinical risk factors. Methods: RTCs (n= 363) underwent SPECT and clinical risk stratification according to the American Society of Transplantation (AST) algorithm and were followed up until a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) or death. Results: Of the 363 patients, 79 patients (22 %) had an abnormal SPECT scan and 270 (74 %) were classified as high risk. Both methods correctly identified patients with increased probability of MACE. However, clinical stratification performed better (sensitivity and negative predictive value 99 % and 99 % vs. 25 % and 87 %, respectively). High-risk patients with an abnormal SPECT scan had a modest increased risk of events (log-rank = 0. 03; hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 37; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 02 - 1. 82). Eighty-six patients underwent coronary angiography, and coronary artery disease (CAD) was found in 60 %. <b>High-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> had an increased incidence of events (log-rank = 0. 008; HR= 3. 85; 95 % CI, 1. 46 - 13. 22), but in those with an abnormal SPECT scan, the incidence of events was not influenced by CAD (log-rank = 0. 23). Forty-six patients died. Clinical stratification, but not SPECT, correlated with the probability of death (log-rank = 0. 02; HR= 3. 25; 95 % CI, 1. 31 - 10. 82). Conclusion: SPECT should be restricted to high-risk patients. Moreover, in contrast to SPECT, the AST algorithm was also useful for predicting death by any cause in RTCs and for selecting patients for invasive coronary testing.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSerum {{uric acid}} (SUA) has been {{observed}} to be highly associated {{with the development of}} cardiovascular disease for more than 50 years. Several studies have reported elevated SUA as an independent predictor of mortality in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD) after adjustment for classic risk factors but some studies did not find similar results. MethodsBetween January 1997 and December 2003, a prospective cohort study was performed in 1054 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> angiographically defined <b>CAD,</b> and their classic risk factors and SUA levels were determined at enrollment. The study cohort was followed for an average of 3. 2 years, with a median of 3. 1 years. The main outcome measure was death from cardiac disease and any cause. ResultsOf all study patients, 789 (74. 9 %) were men and 265 (25. 1 %) were women. The mean age of the male and female patients was 64. 8 and 66. 9 years, respectively. The mean SUA level of all patients was 410. 4 μmol/L. There were grading effects of SUA quartiles on cardiac and all-cause mortality in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. After adjustment, the multivariate analyses revealed that patients in the highest SUA quartile (> 487 μmol/L) had 2. 08 (95 % CI= 1. 19 – 3. 62, p= 0. 01) fold increased risk of cardiac death, and 1. 68 (95 % CI= 1. 10 – 2. 57, p= 0. 017) fold increase risk of overall mortality compared with the lowest quartile (< 315 μmol/L).

40|$|International audienceWe {{reviewed}} the literature about {{the usefulness of}} screening for carotid artery lesions in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD). The use of duplex ultrasonography to detect carotid lesions has a two-fold interest in this situation. First, it enables the detection of severe carotid artery stenosis (CS), a potentially reversible cause of stroke. Stroke is frequent in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> accounting for at least in one-fourth of all cardiovascular events during follow-up. The mean prevalence of CS > 60 % in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> is 9 %, too low to justify routine carotid screening. However, older age, history of a cerebrovascular event, and peripheral arterial disease are useful factors for focusing screening on a <b>high-risk</b> subset of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Trials assessing the interest of prophylactic carotid surgery in asymptomatic CS of 60 % or more found similar benefits in the subset of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Screening for CS in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting is also important because CS is a marker, and sometimes the source, of perioperative stroke. Unfortunately, randomized studies {{to determine the best}} strategy in this situation are lacking. Second, while measurement of the carotid intima-media thickness does not provide substantial prognostic information for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> the presence of plaque, especially hypoechogenic or echolucent (lipid-rich) plaque, is associated with an unstable or high-risk cardiovascular status. In this situation, specific studies are warranted to compare carotid imaging with biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and stratify the cardiovascular risk...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether the endothelial dysfunction associated <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> (coronary artery disease) and T 2 D (Type 2 diabetes mellitus) is concomitant with elevated mtROS (mitochondrial reactive oxygen species) production in the endothelium and establish if this, in turn, regulates the activity of endothelial AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). We investigated endothelial function, mtROS production and AMPK activation in saphenous veins from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> advanced <b>CAD.</b> Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was impaired in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and T 2 D relative to those <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> alone. Levels of mitochondrial H 2 O 2 and activity of AMPK were significantly elevated in primary HSVECs (human saphenous vein endothelial cells) from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and T 2 D compared <b>with</b> those from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> alone.

40|$|Background. Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a common}} cause of {{hospitalisation}} in cardiac wards, while chronic pancreatitis (CP) is in gastroenterology wards. Both diseases are chronic and the clinical picture is dominated by pain. Objectives. The objective was to describe the psychological characteristics of patients hospitalised for the worsening of CAD and CP. Material and methods. The sample comprised 30 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and 30 <b>with</b> CP.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Patients who have survived a {{coronary}} event are the highest priority for secondary prevention. In the secondary prevention of CAD, strong evidence of the beneficial effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is confirmed. The positive effects of physical activity are well established in primary prevention, but the question of whether these effects also relate to <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> still remains to be explored. It is theoretically possible that kinesiophobia, fear of movement, may prevent successful cardiac rehabilitation. The impact on kinesiophobia by rehabilitation outcomes in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> has not previously been investigated. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the impact of exercise and physical activity in relation to kinesiophobia and cardiac risk markers in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Study I evaluated the effects of high-frequency exercise before and after an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study II examined the level of physical activity in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and investigated the association between physical activity and cardiac risk markers. Study III investigated the validity and reliability of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia Heart (TSK-SV Heart), a brief questionnaire to detect kinesiophobia, in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Study IV described the occurrence of kinesiophobia in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and investigated the impact on kinesiophobia by clinical variables with an influence on rehabilitation outcomes. The main findings were that high-frequency exercise improved the maximum aerobic capacity and muscle function in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> PCI, which may have clear advantages when it comes to preventing the progress of CAD. A relatively high level of physical activity was found among <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> six months after the cardiac event. After adjustment for confounders, statistically significant, yet weak, associations were found between physical activity and several cardiac risk markers. Support was found for the TSK-SV Heart as a reliable, valid questionnaire for measuring kinesiophobia in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> A high level of kinesiophobia was found in 20 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> six months after the cardiac event. In addition, an impact on kinesiophobia was identified by clinical variables with an influence on rehabilitation outcomes in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> representing medical variables, all components of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and health-related quality of life. In conclusion, high-frequency exercise in <b>patients</b> treated <b>with</b> PCI improved their maximum aerobic capacity and muscle function. Significant, yet weak, associations were identified between physical activity and cardiac risk markers in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Several important clinical findings with an impact on rehabilitation outcomes were found to be associated with a high level of kinesiophobia.

The authors sought to identify patients who might benefit from the addition of a nonstatin to background statin therapy. We performed systematic reviews of subgroup analyses from randomized trials and observational studies with statin-treated participants to determine estimated 10 -year absolute risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and to define high-risk and very <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients.</b> We used the relative risk reductions for the addition of a nonstatin to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 ASCVD event over 5 years for each patient group and to allow comparisons with 5 -year cost analyses. The 10 -year ASCVD risk is at least 30 % (very high risk) for statin-treated participants with clinical ASCVD and comorbidities, and 20 % to 29 % (high risk) for those with ASCVD without comorbidities or who have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Adding ezetimibe to reduce low-density LDL-C by 20 % would provide a 5 -year NNT ≤ 50 for very <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl or for <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl, and an NNT ≤ 30 for very <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dl.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) is {{a manifestation of}} a chronic {{inflammation}} in the coronary arteries. The inflammatory process results in accumulation of monocyte derived cells and formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the intima of the vessel wall. Neutrophils are mainly associated with ruptured plaques and the precise role in CAD is not fully known. Extravasation into local inflammatory sites is coordinated by adhesion molecules and chemokines and transforms the leukocytes into activated tissue dwelling cells. The aim of this thesis was to investigate extravasated monocytes and neutrophils in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable <b>CAD.</b> A skin chamber method was applied in order to induce a local inflammation from which extravasated cells were collected. Paper I and II describes extravasated monocytes. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> had a similar number of extravasated monocytes in the chamber exudate compared to healthy subjects. The expression of CD 11 b following extravasation was lower in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> compared to healthy controls. This might result in an increased retention of monocytes at a local inflammatory site. Other markers associated with monocyte extravasation, VLA- 4 and CX 3 CR 1, were not altered. Extravasated monocytes were further analyzed for functional alterations. Markers associated with antigen presentation, HLA-DR and CD 86, and binding of modified cholesterol, CD 36 and scavenger receptor A 1 (SR-A 1) had an increased expression following extravasationcompared to in circulation. Furthermore, the binding of acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) increased following extravasation. Monocytes from patients and controls had a similar functional response. However, the chamber fluid from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> enhanced the expression of CD 36 following in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cells. Paper III and IV describes extravasated neutrophils. Extravasated neutrophils from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> had a significantly lower expression of CD 11 b and a lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following stimulation compared to healthy controls. This might indicate a refractory stage following extravasation in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> The gene expression in extravasated neutrophils was assessed by a gene array. A general induction in the IL- 1 axis was seen following extravasation and was {{associated with an increased}} expression of chemokines. Expression of IL- 1 R on human neutrophils was confirmed with flow cytometry and electron microscopy and stimulation with IL- 1 resulted in CCL and CXCL chemokine gene and protein expressions. Compared to healthy controls, extravasated neutrophils from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> had significantly increased expressions of CCL 20 and CXCL 2. This finding indicates that neutrophils may have an immuno-modulatory role at local inflammatory sites and that <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> have a chemokine profile that could enhance the pathological processes in atherosclerosis. The major findings indicate a potential mechanism for monocyte entrapment at local inflammatory sites. In addition, the local inflammatory milieu in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> might be pro-atherosclerotic.

40|$|AbstractHepatocyte {{growth factor}} (HGF) is an angiogenic, cardioprotective factor {{important}} for tissue and vascular repair.

The HGF concentration was significantly higher, at all time-points, in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> compared to the age-matched controls (P< 0. 001), but was independent of periodontal status. The HGF concentration and the affinity to HSPG adversely fluctuated over time, and the biological activity increased one month after intervention in patients without periodontitis. We conclude that elevated concentration of HGF but with reduced biological activity might indicate a chronic inflammatory profile in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and periodontitis...|$|R
40|$|Alteration of {{endothelial cell}} functions, {{including}} reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) availability, increased endothelial cell apoptosis, adhesion molecule/chemokine expression and pro-thrombotic activation {{are thought to}} contribute to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and coronary-artery-disease (<b>CAD)</b> <b>with</b> its clinical complications, such as acute coronary syndromes. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) from healthy subjects or reconstituted HDL have been observed to exert potential direct anti-atherogenic effects by modulating these endothelial cell functions. Importantly, endothelial effects of HDL have now been reported to be highly heterogeneous, and are modulated as part of immune responses. More recently, this has also been observed for HDL of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> where HDL becomes potentially pro-inflammatory and endothelial-protective properties are markedly altered. Several mechanisms may lead to these altered endothelial effects of HDL in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> including oxidative modification of HDL-associated lipids and proteins, such as apoA-I and paraoxonase- 1, and alterations of HDL-proteome. These findings have to be considered with respect to interpretation of recent clinical studies failing to demonstrate reduced cardiovascular events by HDL-cholesterol raising strategies in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> Both clinical and genetic studies suggest that HDL-cholesterol levels alone are not a sufficient therapeutic target in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD.</b> The focus of this review is to summarize the role of HDL onto endothelial homeostasis and to describe recently characterized molecular pathways involved. We highlight how structural and functional modifications of HDL particles in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> may perturb the physiological homeostasis and lead to a loss of endothelial-protective properties of HDL in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CA...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionWe {{report a}} case of an {{emergency}} <b>high-risk</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> a pararenal aortic aneurysm. ReportOur patient had a pararenal aneurysm with two components: a wide-neck saccular aneurysm below the left renal artery and a fusiform aneurysm. A self-expandable aortic stent was deployed covering both renal arteries, the saccular aneurysm was embolised with microcoils and a bifurcated aortic endograft was anchored inside the aortic stent. The aortic stent imprisoned the microcoils and avoided proximal type I endoleak. The tomography done 15 months after the procedure showed no endoleaks. DiscussionA self-expandable aortic stent can provide an alternative for emergency <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pararenal aortic aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia {{is a new}} {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease. It is a sensitive marker of the vitamin B 12 and folate insufficiency. Folate and vitamin B 12 may be a protective effect on cardiovascular disease. According to limited data about role of vitamin B 12 and folate in coronary artery disease (CAD), we conducted this study to measure these factors in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease and in control subjects. Methods: This case-control study was performed on 139 subjects who underwent coronary angiography in Shiraz. Plasma vitamin B 12 and folate level were measured and compared between <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> and control subjects. Results: 139 individuals {{with a mean age}} 56. 99 ± 11. 93 were enrolled in this study. 31. 2 % of them had a normal coronary angiography. Mean plasma level of folate in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> was lower than control subjects (4. 46 ± 1. 28 ng/ml versus 5. 00 ± 1. 81 ng/ml, P = 0. 04). Also mean plasma level of vitamin B 12 in patients CAD and control subjects were 451. 43 ± 138. 90 and 503. 60 ± 199. 35 pg/ml respectively. Although mean level of vitamin B 12 in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> was lower than control group, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0. 07). Conclusion: Mean plasma level of vitamin B 12 and folate were lower in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> than control group. It seems that supplementation with this vitamins may be useful in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: This article reviews {{recent studies}} {{relating}} {{to the impact of}} depression and its treatment on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Articles for the primary review were identified via MEDLINE and PsycINFO (1995 - 2006). Results: Evidence suggests that depression has an aversive impact on the HRQOL of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable <b>CAD</b> as well as on patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Unfortunately, there are few depression treatment studies in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> that make use of standardized HRQOL measures, but the limited evidence suggests that successful treatment has positive implications for HRQOL in these patients. The mechanisms through which depression impacts on HRQOL require further study but are likely to be behavioral. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms significantly undermine HRQOL in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD</b> despite successful medical and surgical management. Although successful treatment of depression has not been shown to reduce mortality rates in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>CAD,</b> further study may find that the HRQOL benefits of such treatment are equally valuable. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Low {{mortality}} rates for elective surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms justify an aggressive approach in most <b>patients.</b> However, in <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> small aneurysms and no symptoms, {{the decision to}} operate remains a delicate balance of risk and benefit. Our observations include 99 <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms initially measuring 3 to 6 cm in the largest transverse diameter, who have been followed 1 to 9 years (average 2. 4 years) with serial echographic measurements. Elective operations were performed for aneurysmal enlargement greater than 6 cm or symptom development. An additional 11 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> aneurysms initially greater than 6 cm, whose initial evaluation {{did not result in}} elective surgery, were also followed. Serial data documented a mean expansion rate of 0. 4 cm/year for aneurysms smaller than 6 cm. Forty-one of these 99 <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> small aneurysms eventually underwent an elective resection with two deaths (4. 9 %). Thirty-four patients (34 %) died from causes unrelated to their unoperated aneurysms, and 21 patients (21 %) are alive without symptoms. Three of the 99 patients suffered aneurysm rupture and emergency operation with two deaths. Thus, of the 99 <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> small aneurysms, four have died of elective aneurysm surgery or rupture (4 %). A protocol of re-echo (or computerized tomography) examination at 3 -month intervals appears to define which of these <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> require elective aneurysm surgery, and has limited rupture to less than 5 %. Improved criteria may emerge from recent advances in high-resolution computerized tomography...|$|R
