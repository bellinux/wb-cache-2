5|$|Since the 1950s Keynsham {{has become}} a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Bristol and Bath. The High Street {{shopping}} area has been remodelled, and a Town Hall, Library, and Clock Tower {{were built in the}} mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{population}} is expanding, and Portishead is now primarily a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Bristol and its environs, although {{a range of}} service industries has grown up. The headquarters of Avon and Somerset Constabulary are in Portishead.|$|E
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town,</b> supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E
25|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} Meath residents commute into Dublin, with a resulting {{shift to a}} services based economy in the developing <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Governmental and tax raising {{boundaries}} separate Milngavie and Bearsden, {{along with}} other wealthy <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> like Newton Mearns and Giffnock, from the City of Glasgow unitary authority area.|$|R
50|$|The close {{proximity}} to Helsinki {{has led to a}} considerable growth of the major villages such as Klaukkala and Rajamäki, which nowadays are considered <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> of Helsinki. Klaukkala is the biggest built-up area of Nurmijärvi.|$|R
5|$|Clevedon {{has some}} light industry, mainly in {{industrial}} estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 motorway junction, {{and it is}} also a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Bristol. The Clerical Medical pensions and investments group, part of HBOS, had its headquarters in the town on the former site of the Hales Cakes factory, but after its closure, North Somerset Council entered into talks to take over the lease. Percy Daniel & Co is a firm of organ builders, whose work includes the instrument in Brentwood Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Llantwit {{developed}} into a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> and grew about 15 times in size to accommodate the Royal Air Force at St Athan. Despite its modernization and rapid growth, it retains its pre-modern feel with its narrow winding streets, high walls, old town hall and gatehouse, and several inns and houses dated to the 16th century. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. In 2014, it was rated {{one of the most}} attractive postcode areas to live in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen is {{the largest}} {{settlement}} on the archipelago, {{the seat of the}} governor and the only town to be incorporated. The town features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports center with a swimming pool, library, culture center, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly. Only {{a small fraction of the}} mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town,</b> with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly.|$|E
50|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{which is}} extremely widespread is {{the practice of}} local residents who travel every day to work in Switzerland. These so-called frontalieri (i.e. 'borderers') make Luino and neighbouring <b>towns</b> and villages <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> to some extent.|$|R
5000|$|Tower (...) (Ordnance Survey Ireland name Model Village) is {{a village}} in County Cork, Ireland, {{northwest}} of Cork city. It is 3 km from Blarney and the two villages are merging along the R617 road and are <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> for Cork city.|$|R
50|$|In West Bank {{community}} settlements, single-family housing {{with private}} yards, emblems of status, often prevail. Another characteristic is that, unlike kibbutzim and moshavim, community settlements generally lack agriculture and depend heavily on commuting for employment. In this sense, they serve primarily as <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> or quarters.|$|R
5|$|John Richard Deacon {{was born}} in Leicester on 19 August 1951, to Arthur Henry and Lilian Molly Deacon. His younger sister, Julie, was born five years later. His father worked at the Norwich Union {{insurance}} company and in 1960 {{the family moved to}} the <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> of Oadby. Deacon was known to friends and his bandmates as 'Deaks' or 'Deaky' and attended Linden Junior School in Leicester, Gartree High School and Beauchamp Grammar School in Oadby. He became interested in electronics, reading magazines on the subject and building small devices, including the modification of a reel to reel tape deck to record music directly off the radio. He studied well and achieved 8 GCE O level and 3 A level passes, all at grade A. He also enjoyed soul music in particular.|$|E
5|$|Salisbury, then a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> to {{the north}} of Adelaide, became a defence centre; the shipyards at Whyalla began {{launching}} corvettes in 1941 just as Japan entered the war. All of these developments were done under Playford's watch, with most of the factories being built by the Department of Manpower and the South Australian Housing Trust. In Woodville in western Adelaide, a large plant for Actil cotton was built. The explosives factory at Salisbury was converted into an aerospace research facility after the war, as various companies worked on matters related to rocket testing at Woomera in the state's far north; the Salisbury complex became the second largest employer of South Australians for a period after the war. The munitions factory in the western suburb of Hendon was later converted into a plant for the electrical appliance firm Philips and at its peak employed more than three thousand people.|$|E
5|$|The seafront has {{ornamental}} gardens, a Victorian bandstand {{and other}} attractions. Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter {{and is used}} for donkey rides in the summer. The shore consists of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour at {{the western edge of}} the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo. The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Clevedon Pier, opened in 1869, is one of the earliest surviving examples of a Victorian pier. On 17 October 1970, two outward spans collapsed when the seventh set of legs from the shore failed during a routine insurance load test. A trust was eventually formed and the pier and its buildings were restored and reopened on 27 May 1989, when the Waverley paddle steamer berthed and took on passengers. Other landmarks include Walton Castle, Clevedon Court the Clock Tower and the Curzon Cinema. Clevedon's light industry is centred mainly in industrial estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 motorway junction. It is a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Bristol. The town is home to educational, religious and cultural buildings and sports clubs.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the XXXIII IAHS World Congress on Housing, 27 - 30 September 2005,"Transforming Housing Environments through Design", University of Pretoria. Constitutionally, apartheid divided South Africa into “white” and “black” South Africa. White South Africa consisted mainly of the urban areas, while black South Africa was mainly rural. Black South Africa was largely comprised of the homeland areas. However, urban areas have subsequently developed {{in most of the}} former homelands. At the same time, a number of <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> were developed, either in these homelands or adjacent to them. Black people who wanted to work in white South Africa had to commute between these <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> and the urban areas in white South Africa. Housing provision under apartheid (1948) started with large-scale investments in the black townships of white South Africa. However, in the late 1960 s, funds were redirected to homeland areas and <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns.</b> When the first post-apartheid government took over in 1994, the previous government had been spending only 1. 3 % of the budget on housing. Although the post-apartheid era has a well-developed housing policy that addresses a variety of aspects, very little has been said, up to now, {{on how to deal with}} these previous homeland areas or <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns.</b> For example, how important are they in terms of housing delivery, considering the fact that the apartheid policy actually favoured these areas? At the same time, it should also be acknowledged that they are usually the areas in South Africa that are worst hit by poverty. It is against this background that the paper aims to outline the dilemma concerning spatial policy frameworks in South Africa, as well as delivery figures in former homeland areas and <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns.</b> The Free State province will serve as a case study to outline the dilemma, the absence of policy, and the practice of housing delivery.

50|$|A coastal {{seat on the}} {{northern}} bank of the Tyne. North Shields and the communities along the Tyne itself {{tend to be more}} industrial and working class, once dominated by coal mining and shipbuilding. The coastal towns to the north, such as Whitley Bay, tend to be more middle class <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> for Newcastle commuters.|$|R
50|$|Residential {{communities}} are typically communities that help support more commercial or industrial communities with consumers and workers. That phenomenon is probably {{because some people}} prefer not {{to live in an}} urban or industrial area, but rather a suburban or rural setting. For that reason, they are also called <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns,</b> bedroom communities, or commuter towns.|$|R
25|$|Further to {{the east}} of Portlethen Moss lie three {{original}} coastal fishing villages: Findon, Portlethen Village and Downies. In the period 1960 to 2005, Portlethen has developed as a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> to Aberdeen and a location for retail superstores.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of holiday {{visitors}} has greatly declined, the town retains a substantial retired population, representing over 25% of residents, but Penarth is now predominantly a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Cardiff commuters. The town’s population was recorded as 20,396 in the United Kingdom Census 2001.|$|E
25|$|Sandbach is now {{in large}} part a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for the {{adjacent}} conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the Potteries. A {{large number of people}} work at Cheshire East Council, which has its headquarters at Westfields. There is light industry, manufacturing and warehouses at Millbuck Industrial Area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electorate}} was re-created {{due to the}} [...] {{change to}} mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting and the resulting {{reduction in the number}} of constituencies. The second historical Hunua electorate contained a selection of <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> in south Auckland, of which Papakura was the largest. The Hunua electorate was abolished again in 2002 and replaced by [...]|$|R
50|$|Northavon {{covered the}} same area as the former Northavon {{district}} (the more rural part of the current South Gloucestershire district) at its creation, {{but some of the}} constituency moved to Bristol North West with the boundary review implemented in 1997. The constituency included suburban and industrial areas on the outskirts of Bristol and several <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> and small villages.|$|R
50|$|Set {{within the}} London green belt, the towns still retain {{something}} {{of their own}} identities. Welwyn Garden City has a famous heritage being {{one of only two}} Garden Cities in the country, and is uniquely both Garden City and designated New Town. They function to some extent as <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> for householders who work in London. The Welwyn Viaduct is a locally important landmark.|$|R
25|$|Seaford's {{fortunes}} revived in the 19th {{century with}} the arrival of the railway connecting the town to Lewes and London. It became a small seaside resort town, and more recently a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for the nearby larger settlements of Eastbourne and Brighton, as well as for London.|$|E
25|$|A former {{market and}} {{administrative}} centre, North Petherton is now largely a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for workers in Bridgwater, 3miles (5km) {{to the north}} east, and Taunton, 8miles (13km) to the south west. The {{centre of the town}} is designated an Area of High Archaeological Potential (AHAP), and a number of buildings have been given listed building status.|$|E
25|$|Today, Dunfermline is {{the main}} centre for the West Fife area, and is also {{considered}} to be a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for Edinburgh. The town has shopping facilities, a major public park, a main college campus at Halbeath and an-out-of-town leisure park with a multiplex cinema and a number of restaurants. The online retailer Amazon.com has opened a major distribution centre in the Duloch Park area of Dunfermline.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} forty years people have {{moved out of}} the cities and into <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> and suburbs. In {{addition}} thirty-five new towns, such as Milton Keynes were created across the country (Kerswill, 2001). Industrialisation often causes an increase in work opportunities in a certain area causing people to move and evoking a general willingness to adopt certain language features that are typical for this area (Milroy, 2002).|$|R
5000|$|Ellon {{has benefited}} from the North Sea oil demand, {{and is one of}} the main <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> for Aberdeen. It is part of the {{proposed}} Energetica corridor of development. [...] The population is expanding as young families seek to escape Aberdeen and move to nearby towns like Ellon, Inverurie and Banchory. During 2006, Ellon ranked as the town with the fourth most rapidly increasing average house prices in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The {{constituency}} includes rural hinterland to {{the east}} of Leeds, including the historical market town of Wetherby and former coal mining towns and villages like Garforth and Kippax. The area is undergoing a transition from old mining communities to more affluent commuter and <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns</b> for the Leeds conurbation to the west. There is no town of Elmet: the name refers to an ancient Celtic kingdom in the area.|$|R
25|$|Light {{industry}} is {{present on the}} Island Carr and Atherton Way industrial estates. A 260 MW gas–fired power station, owned by Centrica, sits to the south–west of the town. A second, 40 MW straw–fired, power station has been approved for construction alongside. A significant number of residents commute to work in nearby Scunthorpe and Grimsby, although the town is not characterized as a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
25|$|Banks is {{the largest}} of the villages in the parish of North Meols on the West Lancashire coastal plain. Like most of them, it was {{primarily}} an agricultural community due to the excellent soil, although there was fishing activity for many years. Production of flowers and vegetables is common on the farms surrounding the village; however the proximity of Southport and Preston have led to Banks' expansion as a <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> for commuters.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{has never}} been well served by {{suburban}} railways, though the Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and Severn Beach survived the Beeching Axe and is still in operation today– in 2006 funding was secured to improve the frequency of services on this line from late 2007. Usage of the Severn Beach line {{has more than doubled}} in the past decade, but still {{only a small percentage of}} Bristol residents use it for commuting. The Portishead Railway was closed in the Beeching Axe but was relaid between 2000–2002 as far as the Royal Portbury Dock with a Strategic Rail Authority rail-freight grant. Plans to relay a further three miles of track to Portishead, a largely <b>dormitory</b> <b>town</b> with only one connecting road, have been approved.|$|E
50|$|Commuting {{has had a}} large {{impact on}} modern life. It has allowed cities to grow to sizes that were {{previously}} not practical, and {{it has led to}} the proliferation of suburbs. Many large cities or conurbations are surrounded by commuter belts, also known as metropolitan areas, commuter <b>towns,</b> <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns,</b> or bedroom communities. The prototypical commuter lives in one of these areas and travels daily to work or to school in the core city.|$|R
25|$|Today {{the plain}} of Valence is {{organised}} around the Valence infrastructure whose urban sprawl gradually extends across its whole area. A number of communes however retain their village identity and their rural character, protecting them from changing into <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns.</b> These are ancient agricultural villages, {{especially those that}} precede the first villages {{on the side of}} Vercors. Their names evoke an initial high placement to readily give a defensive view of the plain of Valence: Montélier, Montvendre, Montéléger, Montoison, Montmeyran and Beaumont-lès-Valence.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the rural}} Welsh {{real-estate}} market was driven by a cycle of growing <b>dormitory</b> <b>towns,</b> which was exacerbated by second home buyers and growing retirement communities. Many buyers were drawn to Wales from England because of relatively inexpensive house prices in Wales as compared to house prices in England. The rise in home prices outpaced the average earnings income in Wales, and meant that many local people {{could not afford to}} purchase their first home or compete against commuter or second-home buyers.|$|R
