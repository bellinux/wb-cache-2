Aim: Analyze the <b>head</b> <b>alignment</b> in students with normal hearing and students with sensorineural hearing loss and compare the data between groups. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study examined the <b>head</b> <b>alignment</b> of 96 students, 48 with normal hearing and 48 with sensorineural hearing loss, aged between 7 and 18 years.

The method is designed for use in neurology to discover relationships between some neurological disorders (such as disorders of vestibular system) and postural <b>head</b> <b>alignment.</b> The main goal {{of this study is}} to compare possibilities of the method with callibration and validation tests. It means with the special accurate protractor in case of the head inclination and head flexion/extension and with the stepper motor including planet gearbox in case of the head rotation.

40|$|Introduction It is {{expected}} that a child will acquire control of posture (CP) {{of the head and}} upper limbs in a gradual, sequential and organized way. However, there is still no consensus regarding the best position to achieve this; the evidence suggests that it is prone. Objective To investigate whether age and inclination of the supporting surface in the prone position influence the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>head</b> and upper limbs of children with typical motor development (TMD) and atypical motor development (AMD). Methods The study included 29 children aged between one and three months divided according to the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) into groups with TMD (n = 18) and AMD (n = 11). The children were placed in the prone position with three angles of the support surface (0 &# 176;, 25 &# 176; and 45 &# 176;). Kinematic analysis was conducted to evaluate the alignment angles of the head and upper limbs. Results Children with TMD had higher <b>head</b> <b>alignment.</b> There was no difference in the upper limbs&# 8217; alignment between the group with TMD and the group with AMD. In the third month of age compared with the first, increased <b>head</b> <b>alignment</b> and decreased upper limb alignment were found in both groups. The inclination of the supporting surface did not influence the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>head</b> and upper limbs.

The spanning tree requirement is further shown to be a necessary condition when the clusters connect acyclicly with each other.

50|$|The {{common problem}} with {{sensitive}} data is that deleted files {{are not really}} erased and so may be recovered by interested parties. Most file systems only remove the link to data (see undelete, above).

Special software is available that overwrites data, and modern (post-2001) ATA drives include a secure erase command in firmware. However, high security applications and high-security enterprises can sometimes require that a disk drive be physically destroyed to ensure data is not recoverable, as microscopic changes in <b>head</b> <b>alignment</b> and other effects can mean even such measures are not guaranteed.

We propose that four factors influence the performance of migration, in the proposed behavior, namely: (1) averaging through <b>heading</b> <b>alignment</b> behavior, (2) disturbances caused by proximal control behavior, (3) noise in sensing the homing direction, and (4) differences in the characteristics of the individuals.

40|$|Coherent {{collective}} behavior {{emerges from}} local interactions between individuals that generate group dynamics. An outstanding {{question is how}} to quantify group coordination of non-rhythmic behavior, {{in order to understand the}} nature of these dynamics at both a local and global level. We investigate this problem in the context of a small group of four pedestrians walking to a goal, treating their speed, and heading as behavioral variables. To measure the local coordination between pairs of pedestrians, we employ cross-correlation to estimate coupling strength and cross-recurrence quantification (CRQ) analysis to estimate dynamic stability. When compared to reshuffled virtual control groups, the results indicate lower-dimensional behavior and a stronger, more stable coupling of walking speed in real groups. There were no differences in <b>heading</b> <b>alignment</b> observed between the real and virtual groups, due to the common goal. By modeling the local speed coupling, we can simulate coordination at the dyad and group levels. The findings demonstrate spontaneous coordination in pedestrian groups that gives rise to coherent global behavior.
