The strength of the fired samples at 1000 and 1100 °C were significantly improved with SF addition. It was concluded that the reactive amorphous nature of SF particles enhances the sintering action locally and this gives better strength behaviour. SF addition also improved the efflorescence behaviour of the bricks. It was concluded that the effect of SF addition on the fired clay brick mainly depends on the firing temperature.

40|$|Emulsification {{behaviour}} {{caused by}} gas bubbles rising through a slag/metal interface was studied in both a thin-slice model and a three-dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous and oil/mercury analogues. A generalized model characterizing the transitional volume of droplets entrained {{in the upper}} phase in the emulsification process was developed. The transient volume of "metal" entrained, $ rm V sb{d}(t),$ following the start of bubbling followed the relation $ rm V sb{d}(t) =V sb{ propto}(1 -e sp{-t/ tau}). $ Based on this model, the birth rate and mean residence time of droplets dispersed by rising bubbles could be quantified. Dimensional {{analysis was used to}} express the volume of lower liquid carried up into the emulsion per bubble, thereby allowing better estimates of the droplet birth rate in a practical emulsification process induced by bottom blowing. Emulsification behaviour in industrial in-bath smelting processes were interpreted with the present modelling results. Slag foaming in "in-bath" iron smelting was modelled by injecting gas through a porous disc into a vertical cylinder containing a variety of low temperature liquids. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical arguments, difficulties with previous studies characterizing foam height as a function of fluid properties were addressed, and an alternative analysis {{in the form of a}} general relationship was developed. The fractional volume of gas holdup, $ varepsilon,$ in foaming slags containing large spherical cap bubbles could be expressed as $ rm varepsilon=U sb{g}/ lbrack U sb{g}+(0. 5 gd sb{b}) sp{ 0. 5 } rbrack. $ The average bubble size in the foaming slag of the AISI pilot trials on the smelting reduction of iron ores was estimated to be 10 - 25 cm equivalent diameter, suggesting that significant coalescence of small bubbles (such as CO) occurs in the process. In modelling the mixing behaviour of ferroalloy additions in intensively stirred reactors, the AOD process was used to simulate slag chrome oxide reduction period by <b>ferro-silicon</b> additions. These phenomena were examined with the aid of a two dimensional slice model and then a three dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous analogues. Based on these modelling studies, it was observed that the ascending gas/liquid plume created two asymmetric mixing zones: a smaller mixing zone near the side wall fitted with tuyeres and a larger main mixing zone away from it. In "slag free" experiments, a dead zone formed at the far surface corner opposite the tuyeres. There, the particles simulating ferro-alloy additions accumulated. However, in the "slag covered" model experiments, the injected gas generated an emulsified "slag/metal" phase of lower apparent density which lead to the entrainment of the buoyant <b>ferro-silicon</b> alloy additions. This, in conjunction with the significantly modified flow patterns, and absence of any dead zones, allowed the particles simulating ferroalloy additions to be readily entrained within the recirculation flow. These results suggest that the mixing-in of such additions into the molten slag during the chrome oxide reduction period can be accomplished efficiently...|$|E

The {{aim was to}} predict and give {{a better understanding of}} the combustion in electric arc furnaces for the production of <b>ferro-silicon</b> and silicon metal. Another important objective was to assess the impact of a number of operating parameters on the NOx formation. The CFD tools used are de-scribed with a special focus on models for species and turbulence transport. Sensitivity studies have been car-ried out to study the influence of several parameters: sub-models, process gas composition and distribution at the charge surface and influence of the presence of SiO. The main conclusions are: • Using the combination of a realistic design, boundary conditions and models, the simulated NOx level is in quantitative agreement with measurements. The presence of water vapor is particularly important because of its influence on the specific heat of the mixture and resulting temperature. • Release of significant amounts of SiO from the charge surface results in an important increase of NOx, even if we applied a simplified combustion model for SiO gas. However, because of lack of thermal and compositional data for blowing situations (when SiO flows directly from the arc cavity through open channels to the charge surface), no quantitative validation is possible. The way SiO is distributed (uni-formly or as a jet) has a limited impact on the result in our computations. 1...|$|E

The Magnetherm process is also a vacuum batch process based on similar chemistry but operates at higher temperatures with magnesia dissolved in a slag. Various operational issues relating to the batch and vacuum nature of the process have limited its development.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{large-scale}} contacting methods for gas reactions requiring a solid catalyst. The catalytic gas-solid Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) {{is one of}} the popular methods in industry. In FBRs the bulk of the gas throughput is present as lean bubbles, mostly deprived of solids, bubbling through a solids-rich emulsion phase. The movement of gas {{into and out of the}} emulsion often dictates the performance of an FBR. During the past five decades major contributions have been made towards the understanding of FBRs, although numerous gaps still exist, especially at higher bubbling regime velocities. This work follows an integrated approach for the simultaneous measurement of hydrodynamics and reactor performance. Hydrodynamics are measured using fast X-Ray Tomography (XRT), pressure analysis techniques and an optical fibre probe. Reactor performance is measured by utilizing the ozone decomposition reaction. Performance is quantified using a basic two-phase reactor model with an apparent overall interphase mass transfer (K 0) parameter. Two 14 cm (ID) fluidized bed columns are used, one setup supporting the ozone decomposition reaction and the other installed within a fast XRT facility. Special emphasis is placed on superficial velocities (U 0) spanning the entire bubbling regime up to the onset of the turbulent regime (Uc). The particle types employed are Geldart B sand particles and highly dense <b>ferro-silicon</b> (FeSi) particles. Fines are added to both particle types, resulting in a total of four particle systems (sand baseline; sand with fines; FeSi baseline; FeSi with fines). Time constraints on the XRT equipment limited the tomography measurements to the sand baseline particle system. The hydrodynamics of the other particle systems were limited to the pressure signal and optical probe measurements of the ozone decomposition setup. The results of the sand baseline system suggest that a distinction should be made between the low-interaction bubbling regime and the high-interaction bubbling regime. A change in mass transfer behaviour occurs around a U 0 /Uc value of 0. 25. Reactor performance increases up to U 0 /Uc = 0. 7, after which a decreasing trend is observed. An empirical correlation is proposed for the specific interphase mass transfer (kbe) of the higher velocity bubbling regime. This correlation is based on the integration of the hydrodynamics determined by means of XRT and reactor performance: 4 - 12 The hydrodynamic parameter β gives the best fit for the entire velocity range with an average error of 8 %, although it is not recommended for U 0 /Uc< 0. 17. It is observed that the classical approach of penetration theory for interphase mass transfer, performs exceptionally well at low velocities (U 0 /Uc< 0. 34). The addition of fines to the FeSi particle type decreases the overall reactor performance, despite decreased bubble sizes. The solids fraction, however, unexpectedly increases with the addition of fines and a collapse of the emulsion phase is measured. It is therefore postulated that though flow in the emulsion phase is much higher for the FeSi baseline system and decreases with the addition of fines. For the sand particle type, the behaviour expected from literature is observed: reactor performance increases, bubble sizes decrease and the solids fraction decreases. Very distinct hydrodynamic behaviour is observed for all the fluidization regimes with XRT. Probability density distributions show there are still two phases present in the turbulent regime and that the emulsion-phase solids fraction remains independent of velocity until fast fluidization sets in. The turbulent regime has unique hydrodynamic behaviour, although voids appear to be a transient structure between the structures of the bubbling and fast fluidization regimes.
