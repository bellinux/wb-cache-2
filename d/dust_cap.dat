5000|$|A {{more common}} {{approach}} is to employ the <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> as a high frequency radiator. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> radiates low frequencies, moving {{as part of the}} main assembly, but due to low-mass and reduced damping, radiates increased energy at higher frequencies. As with whizzer cones, careful selection of material, shape and position are required to provide smooth, extended output. High frequency dispersion is somewhat different for this approach than for whizzer cones. A related {{approach is to}} shape the main cone with such profile, and of such materials, that the neck area remains more rigid, radiating all frequencies, while the outer areas of the cone are selectively decoupled, radiating only at lower frequencies. Cone profiles and materials can be modeled in FEA software and the results predicted to excellent tolerances.|$|E

50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, {{to the metal}} ring that covers the {{bearings}} in a cup-and-cone ball-bearing hubset. These types of <b>dust</b> <b>caps,</b> being press-fit, are difficult to remove with bending or damaging them. It is suggested to press them out {{from the other side}} of the hub using a screw driver. In this role the dustcap reduces the dust that enters the bearing races, and extends service intervals.|$|R
50|$|The woofer is {{made from}} pure, long carbon fibers that were {{fabricated}} into sheets. Eight of the sheets are bonded together to make the cone. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> in the center is also a carbon fiber sheet formed into a dome. The woofer magnet is 11,350 Gauss and 220,000 Maxwell. The frame is diecast aluminum.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{loudspeaker}} designs dust caps {{can also}} {{be part of the}} acoustic design of the driver by radiating high frequency energy or suppressing it. Typically the <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> is made of the same material as the cone. In some tweeter designs, the dome is in fact the only sound radiating surface and so it performs both roles.|$|E
5000|$|Phase plugs may {{be placed}} in front of woofer cones, {{especially}} in horn-loaded loudspeaker designs. In the same fashion as compression driver phase plugs, the intent is to minimize higher-frequency wave interference near the driver. In this case, [...] "high frequency" [...] is relative to the intended bandpass; for example, a 12 in cone woofer might be expected to reproduce 550 Hz energy near the top of its intended range, however, the wavelength of 550 Hz is approximately twice the diameter of the woofer, so wave energy at that frequency traveling laterally {{from one side to the}} other will be out of phase and will cancel. With a phase plug in the center, such lateral wave energy bounces off of the obstruction and is reflected outward toward the listener. Phase plugs for woofer cones are typically solid plugs positioned over the woofer's central <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> or in the center of the woofer, replacing the <b>dust</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some early Super Reverb {{amplifiers}} {{came with}} the option of factory equipped JBL speakers instead of the Jensen, Oxford or Utah speakers widely used {{in the majority of}} Fender amplifiers. The JBL speakers had aluminum <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> with larger magnets and voice coils, this gives a fuller response range and handles more power reducing the risk of [...] "blowing a speaker". These models also add to the overall weight of the amp, making casters (wheels) a very good option.|$|R
5000|$|Even though {{acoustic}} suspension cabinets {{are often}} called [...] "sealed box" [...] designs, {{they are not}} entirely airtight. A small amount of airflow must be allowed so the speaker can adjust to changes in atmospheric pressure. A semi-porous cone surround allows enough airflow for this purpose. Most Acoustic Research designs used a PVA sealer on the foam surrounds to enable a longer component life and enhance performance. The venting was via the cloth spider and cloth <b>dust</b> <b>caps,</b> not so much through the surround.|$|R
50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the bus without other couplers. RFI <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data bus couplers are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
50|$|Construction is of {{the usual}} cast brass housing for {{plumbing}} parts, with a threaded connection to the pipework at the base. The top has a small outlet, usually hidden beneath a plastic <b>dust</b> <b>cap.</b> Internally {{there is a large}} hollow body, normally filled with water, and containing a float valve. The valve must always be installed vertically, usually {{at the top of a}} short vertical pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Some bass {{amplifier}} combos have a [...] "whizzer cone" [...] {{attached to}} the low frequency woofer's centre. The whizzer cone {{is about the same}} size as a <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> although it resembles a miniature speaker cone. The whizzer cone handles the upper frequencies that are too high for the woofer. Roland's 60 watt and 120 watt bass combos contain both a woofer and a whizzer cone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> (also {{known as}} dust dome, or dome) is a gently curved dome mounted either in concave or convex {{orientation}} over the central hole of most loudspeaker diaphragms. It protects the inner mechanics (such as the pole pieces {{and the voice}} coil) from small particles (which can cause rubs) and other contamination. Dust caps can also contribute structural integrity to the voice coil assembly or the cone.|$|E

50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the {{threaded}} counterbore, which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also possible for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|E
50|$|An Elsie mine is {{constructed}} mainly from plastic, {{which makes it}} difficult to detect. The mine comprises two separate items; the body and charge. The body is fitted with a protective <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> which is removed in order to insert the charge. Around the shaft of the charge there is a restraining safety clip to prevent it moving downwards whilst in transit, which could accidentally trigger detonation. The safety clip is removed when the mine is emplaced, at which point the mine becomes armed and will detonate if someone steps on it. Elsie mines are supplied with an aluminium detector ring fitted. However, the ring is designed to be easily removed, and without it the mine becomes a minimal metal mine.|$|E

Response time readings measured in the test box were shorter than the readings obtained using the calibration cup.

40|$|Until {{the early}} 1980 s, mine face {{ventilation}} systems {{were designed for}} ventilating cutting depths up to 20 feet. Since that time, use of remotely operated mining machines have allowed cutting depths to increase to 40 ft, increasing concerns about the effects on methane levels at the mine face area. The principles for efficient methane control during deeper cutting remained the same, namely: 1. Move a sufficient quantity of intake air {{from the end of}} the tubing or curtain to the face. 2. Mix intake air with methane gas liberated at the face. 3. Move methane contaminated air away from the face. However, when cutting to depths greater than 20 ft (known as deep-cut mining), airflow quantities reaching the face area often decreased because it was difficult to maintain tubing or brattice setback distances. Earlier research showed that use of machine-mounted scrubbers and water sprays increased airflow at the face area during deep cutting. NIOSH research examined how these and other factors affected face airflow. A full-scale ventilation test gallery was used to study how different operating conditions caused airflow patterns and methane distributions near the face to vary. The research results showed that during deep-cut mining: 1. Without additional controls, only a small percentage of the air delivered to the end of the tubing or curtain reached the face area. 2. Operation of a machine-mounted scrubber increased airflow and reduced methane levels at the face area as long as the quantity of intake air delivered to the end of the curtain or tubing was not reduced. 3. Operation of water sprays did not significantly increase the volume of air reaching the face but did improve mixing of methane and intake air at the face. Methane monitoring requirements remained the same for deep cutting, but the possibility of rapidly changing conditions at the face increases the need for accurate estimates of face methane concentration. Research examined currently available instrumentation and sampling methods for monitoring methane at the face. The results from this NIOSH research program demonstrate how existing and new engineering controls can be used to (educe face methane levels. The sampling methods that were investigated can provide better ways to measure methane levels near the front of the continuous mining machine. In this report several practical guidelines are recommended for controlling and monitoring methane levels in the face areas of underground coal mines. Most of the recommendations were based on studies conducted in the NIOSH ventilation test gallery. 1. Free-standing fans can be used to ventilate empty headings in coal mines; a) The fan nozzle should be designed to provide maximum throw distance. b) Recirculation should be minimized by proper placement of fan inlet and or by placing curtains partway across the entry. 2. With blowing systems, the single most important factor on face methane dilution is the velocity of the air directed toward the face; a) For the same airflows, use of tubing rather than a curtain usually provides better control of face methane, especially at longer setback distances. 3. With blowing and exhausting systems, and with the mining machine at the face, use of scrubbers increases the amount of intake airflow reaching the mining face; a) Scrubber and spray systems should be designed to achieve efficient face ventilation for the effective removal of gas from the face. 4. Measurement of airflow speed and direction between the curtain and the face helps to predict methane concentrations in the face area; a) In empty entries, airflow velocity is much lower in narrower entries. More airflow should be provided during box cuts to prevent higher methane levels. 5. Regardless of intake flow quantity, increasing scrubber flow will reduce face methane levels if recirculation is controlled. Recirculation can be controlled by; a) Minimizing leakage around the ventilation curtain; b) Directing scrubber exhaust away from the blowing curtain. With exhaust systems the mouth of the curtain should always be outby the scrubber exhaust. 6. Water sprays on the mining machine should be directed to provide the best airflow across the entire face. 7. Methanometer response times can be measured using either of two techniques developed by NIOSH. Instruments with shorter response times more accurately measure current methane levels. <b>Dust</b> <b>cap</b> design has the greatest effect on response times; a) When selecting a methanometer the <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> design should be examined. The cap should protect the methane sensor from dust and water but not significantly increase the response time. 8. Alternative methane sampling locations on the mining machine should be compared and selected based on the relative protection provided to the face workers. 9. Mine personnel should be provided with methane monitors that can be worn while working in areas that cannot be regularly monitored. Audible, visual, and vibratory alarms for the monitors should be evaluated based on the environment in which the instruments are used. 10. Miners must be safely removed from a mine without exposure to excessive methane following stoppage of a main fan; a) Mines should be evaluated for the most likely area where methane gas can accumulate following stoppage of a main mine fan. 11. In areas between the mouth of the ventilation curtain and the face, airflow direction is constantly changing and it is difficult to accurately measure flow velocity with a single-axis anemometer (e. g., a vane anemometer); a) Following approval for underground use, multi-axis anemometers should be used to monitor airflow direction and velocity between the mouth of the ventilation curtain or tubing and the face. Multi-axis instruments should also be used to monitor flow at locations outby the mining face. 12. During roof bolting, if it is not practical to monitor methane levels at the mining face, methane levels should be measured with a bolter machine-mounted monitor and a detector held 16 ft inby the last row of bolts using a extensible pole.

40|$|Stockton Opencast Coalmine has well {{documented}} acid mine drainage (AMD), {{which is the}} result of oxidation and leaching of sulfide-rich Brunner Coal Measures waste rock. This thesis investigates the potential of mitigating AMD effects through encapsulating the waste material in a wet cover system. Specifically four locally available cap-rocks have been examined being, fresh and weathered Kaiata Formation mudstones, silt pond fines (SPF) and weathered Berlins Porphyry. These materials are tested in the laboratory, geotechnically, using grain size analysis, Atterberg limits, double-ring infiltrometer, and slake durability and geochemically, using paste pH, net acid producing potential, kinetic net acid generation, and free draining leachate columns. Field trials, using 10 m x 10 m small-scale capped waste dump pads, and computer modelling predictions, have then been applied to make recommendations on the wet cover design best suited to Stockton Coalmine. The geotechnical tests indicate the two Kaiata mudstone materials tested have the most satisfactory properties for a moisture retaining cap-rock achieving permeability > 1 x 10 ⁻¹⁰ ms⁻¹ after compaction. The Berlins Porphyry also displays geotechnical properties suitable for capping (permeability > 1 x 10 ⁻⁸ ms⁻¹) after compaction, but the SPF prove least favourable in geotechnical characteristics (permeability ~ 2 x 10 ⁻⁷ ms⁻¹ with the addition of cement kiln dust). The geochemical data identifies the weathered Berlins Porphyry as minimally acid producing, the SPF as potentially acid forming (PAF), and both Kaiata samples as high PAF which is a significant factor in wet cover design. The leachate data from the field trials indicated that the 1 m thick compacted Kaiata mudstone capped field trial (both fresh and weathered), and the 1 m SPF plus cement kiln <b>dust</b> <b>capped</b> field trial, performed the most efficiently in reducing acidity levels and associated metals, followed by the 1 m thick compacted Berlins Porphyry cap-rock. The O₂% profiles indicated that the compacted weathered Kaiata mudstone with the addition of topsoil slowed oxygen diffusion most effectively, followed by the 1 m compacted fresh Kaiata cap and the 1 m uncompacted weathered Kaiata cap. The other tested capping regimes did not significantly affect O₂ ingress. The computer modelling showed that compacted Kaiata had adequate moisture retaining properties and also showed that both Berlins Porphyry and Kaiata mudstone cap saturation increases with time. It is recommended that Kaiata mudstone or the Berlins Porphyry is used as the 1 m thick caprock material. Where the Kaiata is identified as non-acid forming the mudstone should be selectively stockpiled for use in the wet cover system. DRI testing during after cap-rock compaction should be done at regular intervals to ensure permeabilities of < 1 x 10 ⁻⁷ ms⁻¹ are achieved. Topsoil with a high permeability should placed on top of the cap-rock to complete the wet cover system and waste dump at approximately 20 ° to prevent drying out of the cap-rock.

Climatically induced fluctuation of the perennial ice margin has influenced the evolution of both units. Periodic exposure to the atmosphere has allowed erosion of curvilinear troughs in the surface of the layered deposits. Intervening periods of deposition may have resulted in gradual poleward migration of the trough forms, leaving behind sets of low-amplitude surface undulations in former trough locations. Advance and retreat of the perennial ice margin has also probably resulted in a fine interfingering of the layered deposits-debris mantle contract.

When a customer went to buy the wire wheels, the make of the vehicle would be stamped in the center. During 1927 and 1928, the first snap-on center caps were being made on the wire wheels. After 1932, most every car had a snap-on style center cap on the middle of their wire, steel, or wood wheels.
