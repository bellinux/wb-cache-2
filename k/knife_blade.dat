25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the <b>knife</b> <b>blade,</b> itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E

His remains were interred in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.|$|E
25|$|The thumb lug on the Umnumzaan is {{used for}} opening the <b>knife</b> <b>blade,</b> as well as serving as the stop pin that {{contacts}} the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane o-ring {{that acts as a}} shock absorber to cushion the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.|$|E

The pathologist found some defensive wounds, and that the attack targeted aspects of beauty and was intended to disfigure.|$|E
25|$|As the {{recording}} industry grew, country blues performers like Bo Carter, Jimmie Rodgers (country singer), Blind Lemon Jefferson, Lonnie Johnson, Tampa Red and Blind Blake became more popular in the African American community. Kentucky-born Sylvester Weaver was in 1923 the first to record the slide guitar style, in which a guitar is fretted with a <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> or the sawed-off neck of a bottle. The slide guitar became {{an important part of}} the Delta blues. The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized as a traditional, rural country blues and a more polished city or urban blues.|$|E

25|$|Simple copper {{objects were}} already in use in the 4th {{millennium}} BC, including a copper pin from Lattrigen from 3170 BC and a <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> from Twann. Shortly before 2000 BC bronze production entered the area and brought about a surge in development. Settlements began to spread into the pre-Alpine and Alpine areas. The area between Lake Thun and the Niedersimmental were densely settled. Archeological finds include scattered items along mountain passes, a fortified hilltop settlements at Spiezberg, Cholis Grind by Saanen and at Pintel by Wimmis, along with cemeteries at Thun-Allmendingen, Einigen and Hilterfingen. Late Bronze Age (ca. 1000–800 BC) settlements along Lake Biel (Mörigen, Vinelz) have yielded up a wealth of items.|$|E
500|$|One of Emerson's {{earliest}} production models, the Commander (winner of Blade Magazines Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999), {{is a large}} recurve {{folding knife}} based on a special custom design, the ES1-M, {{that he had made}} for a West Coast Navy SEAL Team. The Commander has a hook on the spine of the blade (originally designed as a blade catcher) which, when snagged {{on the edge of the}} pocket or sheath, causes the <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> to open as it is drawn. Due to its visual aesthetic, Emerson called this innovation the [...] "Wave"and secured a patent for it in 1998. Since another knife and tool company, Leatherman, had trademarked the name [...] "Wave," [...] in March 1999 Emerson changed its name to the [...] "wave-shaped opening feature". Emerson's Wave made its way onto most of the knives in both the production and custom lines, with the exception of the Viper models. It is a required feature on all knives that Emerson supplies to military units, search and rescue units, and law enforcement agencies.|$|E

It also appeared as ceremonial and symbolic jade weapon at around the same time, two being dated from about 2500 BC, are found at the Lingjiatan site in Anhui. The first bronze ge appeared at the early Bronze Age Erlitou site, where two were being found among the over 200 bronze artifacts (as of 2002) at the site, three jade ge were also discovered from the same site. Total of 72 bronze ge in Tomb 1004 at Houjiazhuang, Anyang, 39 jade ge in tomb of Fu Hao and over 50 jade ge at Jinsha site were found alone. It was the basic weapon of Shang (c. 1600– 1050 BC) and Zhou (c.1050–256 BC) infantry, although it was sometimes used by the [...] "striker" [...] of charioteer crews. It consisted of a long wooden shaft with a bronze <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> attached at a right angle to the end. The weapon could be swung down or inward in order to hook or slash, respectively, at an enemy. By the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), military use of the bronze ge had become limited (mostly ceremonial); they were slowly phased out during the Han Dynasty by iron spears and iron ji halberds.|$|E

500|$|This poem {{mentions}} {{the practice of}} carving the sword-owner's name in runes on the hilt. [...] This practice is confirmed by a 6th-century sword pommel from Kent, {{as well as a}} 6th-century silver scabbard mouth-piece from Chessell Down, Isle of Wight, which both preserve fragmentary runic inscriptions. The latter is the only known example of an Anglo-Saxon runic inscription on a weapon from outside Kent. [...] Several other Anglo-Saxon weapons have isolated runic letters on them. [...] For example, a tiw rune , symbolizing the Anglo-Saxon war god Tiw (Tyr in the earlier quotation from the Sigrdrífumál), is found on two sword-pommels and a spear blade, all from Kent. [...] Thus, although some Anglo-Saxon runic inscriptions on weapons are known, none are as extensive or as prominent as the runic inscription on the Seax of Beagnoth. [...] Furthermore, the Seax of Beagnoth is the only known Anglo-Saxon weapon with a runic inscription on its blade, and indeed, other than the Schretzheim sword, which has a cryptic runic inscription on its blade comprising four runes in a cross formation, there are no other certain examples from anywhere in Europe of a sword or <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> with a runic inscription. [...] In contrast, inscriptions in the Latin alphabet occur frequently on Viking swords. [...] For example, some one hundred swords with the maker's name [...] "Ulfberht" [...] inlaid into the blade are known from a period of about 300 years.|$|E
