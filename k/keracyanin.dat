40|$|Radical {{scavenging}} {{capacity of}} a crude methanolic extract from the fruits of Phillyrea latifolia L., commonly known as green olive tree or mock privet, was investigated with reference to anthocyanin standards, as flavonoids, and phenolic acid standards, as phenylpropanoids. Characterization with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) indicated the presence of <b>keracyanin,</b> kuromanin, cyanidin, ferulic acid, caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid at amounts of 289. 1, 90. 4, 191. 4, 225. 2, 221. 2 and 190. 1 mg/ 100 g fresh weight (FW) of fruits, respectively. Chlorogenic and p-coumaric acids were found to exist in lower amounts. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and IC 50 values of the plant extract {{were found to be}} 1. 8 mM Trolox equivalents (TE) /g FW of fruits and 69. 4 Âµg/mL, respectively, indicating the close radical scavenging activity of the extract to those of <b>keracyanin</b> and p-coumaric acid. The crude methanolic P. latifolia L. fruit extract was seen to be fairly potent in radical scavenging. Total phenolic content (TPC) of the plant extract was found to be 1652. 9 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) / 100 g FW of fruits...|$|E
40|$|The {{ripening}} of grape (Vitis vinifera) berry {{is characterized}} by dramatic changes in gene expression, enzymatic activities, and metabolism {{that lead to the}} production of compounds essential for berry quality. The phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway is one of the components involved in these changes. In this study, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of VvMYB 5 a, a cDNA isolated from a grape L. cv Cabernet Sauvignon berry library. VvMYB 5 a encodes a protein belonging to a small subfamily of R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors. Expression studies in grapevine indicate that the VvMYB 5 a gene is mainly expressed during the early steps of berry development in skin, flesh, and seeds. Overexpression of VvMYB 5 a in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) affects the expression of structural genes controlling the synthesis of phenylpropanoid and impacts on the metabolism of anthocyanins, flavonols, tannins, and lignins. Overexpressing VvMYB 5 a induces a strong accumulation of several phenolic compounds, including <b>keracyanin</b> (cyanidin- 3 -rhamnoglucoside) and quercetin- 3 -rhamnoglucoside, which are the main anthocyanin and flavonol compounds in tobacco. In addition, VvMYB 5 a overexpression increases the biosynthesis of condensed tannins and alters lignin metabolism. These findings suggest that VvMYB 5 a may be involved in the control of different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway in grapevine...|$|E
