5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they <b>find</b> <b>interesting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not <b>find</b> <b>interesting.</b> The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E

During this period of relative quiet, Colonel Starr retired from the army in December 1870.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E
500|$|With [...] and [...] already {{released}} under {{a three-game}} exclusivity agreement signed by Nintendo, LucasArts began {{planning for the}} third and final game. After the success of Rogue Squadron in 1998, LucasArts and Factor 5 started initial testing for a follow-up in February 1999. The team discussed how they could build on that success and began planning {{the development of a new}} game engine. Possible plot ideas involving the film [...] were also discussed. After it was released in May 1999, the team watched the movie several times in an attempt to <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> characters, situations and craft for the game. Factor 5 stated that tying a movie plot into a vehicle combat game was [...] "hard". They included all the characters and vehicles from the movie they could, and attempted to mix these elements with entirely new content.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{scheduled to begin}} in February 2013, but was delayed until May 2013. The film was shot by cinematographer Arnaud Potier on an Arri Alexa camera in CinemaScope widescreen format. Levin and Potier decided to use minimalistic wide shots and long takes to avoid [...] "reminding the audience that it's a movie" [...] with unnecessary cuts. Filming mainly {{took place on the}} Upper East Side of New York City. Specific filming locations included the Carlyle Hotel, the St. Regis Hotel, The Guggenheim, Fifth Avenue, Grand Army Plaza, Le Charlot restaurant and Crawford Doyle Booksellers. The only major location used outside of the Upper East Side was Brian's apartment, which was filmed on 30th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Shots of plaques on Central Park benches are interspersed throughout the film; Levin sent a group of interns to <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> inscriptions on the benches in Central Park and selected about thirty that were filmed {{on the last day of}} shooting. The crew adopted a bench of their own whose plaque is shown at the end of the film's credits.|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Lisa Kudrow's role as Alex {{as one of}} {{the sixteen}} great guest {{appearances}} on The Simpsons.

[...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood commented that [...] "The idea of Lisa being unpopular in the light of a new girl in the school hallways is not new (see [...] "Lisa's Rival") but it is done here with such class," [...] concluding of Homer's treatment that [...] "this is an episode which shows that even he can <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> ways to do things." [...] Wesley Mead noted, in a review of the tenth season that the episode [...] "might deal with familiar territory ("Lisa's Rival", anyone?), but it doesn't feel like a retread, and is also home to a superbly realised subplot that sees Homer and Bart go into the grease business." ...|$|E
500|$|But Charles Taylor, {{writing for}} The New York Times, lambasted the film's {{original}} suppression due to [...] "the stupidity of pressure groups" [...] that wrongly labeled {{the film as}} racist when it is, in his words, [...] "a profoundly antiracist film, though a despairing one." [...] He praised Winfield's tense performance and Fuller's use of melodrama to create one of his [...] "most potent" [...] films. Lisa Dombrowski, the author of The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You! and {{an associate professor of}} film studies at Wesleyan University, referred to the film as [...] "an impassioned attack on racial hatred." [...] Another New York Times reviewer, Janet Maslin, praised Fuller's [...] "command of stark, spooky imagery," [...] "B-style bluntness," [...] and the way the cinematography, scene setting, and soundtrack combine to give the film [...] "the blunt, unnerving power of a horror story." [...] She also commended Paul Winfield's performance as Keys, feeling the actor turned what might have been a boring character into one audiences would <b>find</b> <b>interesting.</b> Slant Magazine's Fernando F. Croce felt the film was [...] "part marauding-animal horror movie, part Afterschool Special, [...] part tragic-sardonic agitprop" [...] B-movie that is [...] "searing confrontation of the irrationality of prejudice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could in order to <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly {{out of fear of}} becoming overreliant on it.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a 3.5 out of 4, saying [...] "It's {{entertaining}} as hell" [...] {{and it provides}} [...] "nearly non-stop action". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that [...] "the suspense is killer". [...] Henry Barnes of The Guardian considered World War Z an [...] "attempt at large-scale seriousness" [...] in the zombie genre, {{which resulted in a}} [...] "punchy, if conventional action thriller." [...] Writing for Variety, Scott Foundas thought the film to be a [...] "surprisingly smart, gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie-movie canon", which shows [...] "few visible signs of the massive rewrites, reshoots and other post-production patchwork." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter opined that [...] "Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] " [...] does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to <b>find</b> <b>interesting</b> ways to pass the time within them." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "World War Z plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable, but unless you knew about the film's troubled past, you'd never guess it existed." ...|$|E

My old guide, Al Doyle of Flagstaff, had led me over half of Arizona, but never down into that wonderful wild and rugged basin between the Mogollon Mesa and the Mazatzal Mountains. Doyle had long lived on the frontier and his version of the Pleasant Valley War differed markedly from that of Mr. Adams. I asked other old timers about it, and their remarks further excited my curiosity.|$|E
60|$|My {{first glance}} {{into the place}} was disappointing. I was {{beginning}} to lose faith in Louis.

The ground floor of the cafe through which we passed was like a thousand others in different parts of Paris. The floor was sanded, the people were of the lower orders,--rough-looking men drinking beer or sipping cordials; women from whom one instinctively looked away, and whose shrill laughter was devoid of a single note of music. It was all very flat, very uninteresting. But Louis led the way through a swing door to a staircase, and then, pushing his way through some curtains, along a short passage to another door, against which he softly knocked with his knuckles. It was opened at once, and a commissionnaire stood gazing stolidly out at us, a commissionnaire in the usual sort of uniform, but one of the most powerful-looking men whom I had ever seen in my life.|$|E
