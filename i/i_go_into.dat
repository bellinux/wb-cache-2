Then I start working on the most basic thing— the look.

Once that is achieved, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E

500|$|With {{his recent}} solo work, he has cited {{electronic}} music—in which the guitar is often completely absent—as an influence. His electronic music influences include Aphex Twin, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Human League, Ekkehard Ehlers, Peter Rehberg, and Christian Fennesz. His interests are constantly changing, as {{he believes that}} without change he will no longer {{have any interest in}} playing: [...] "I'm always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records, and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled.|$|E

Jones {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said [...] "It was hard because I'd just had my son and it was make it— or join the army. I had a family to support and at that time, it was either this is it... or <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the services. I was ready for that life." [...] Jones began his professional career with Joe Public in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. He soon moved to W Connection where he played for two years.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{has said}} that with Che, {{he wanted to show}} {{everyday}} tasks, [...] "things that have meaning on a practical level and on an ideological level", as a [...] "way of showing what it might have been like to be there". While addressing the issue after at the Toronto International Film Festival, Soderbergh remarked {{that he was trying to}} avoid what he felt were typical scenes for a biographical film and that he would tell screenwriter Peter Buchman, that he was [...] "trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene that you would typically see in a movie like this". Soderbergh was not interested in depicting Guevara's personal life because he felt that [...] "everybody on these campaigns has a personal life, they all left families behind, that doesn't make him special and why should <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> his personal life and nobody else's?" ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't [...] To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.|$|E

500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E

500|$|Lacroix {{felt that}} with Unbreakable TNA [...] "truly {{cemented}} the formula needed for delivering great pay per views." [...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said: [...] "I {{think this}} is about sheer criminality. That {{is what we have}} seen on the streets. The {{violence}} we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it." [...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, [...] "As a kid I had {{to leave}} my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got {{divorced}} and my mother couldn't support herself.

It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure.
