5|$|Early in its duration, {{the storm}} dropped {{rainfall}} across the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon striking Louisiana, Florence produced a moderate storm surge, causing severe beach erosion in some locations. Gusty winds were also reported, causing power outages to over 100,000people. In Alabama, one man died {{while trying to}} secure his boat. Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding <b>in</b> <b>portions</b> of the Florida Panhandle in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall; the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in Santa Rosa County. Throughout its path, damage totaled about $2.9million (1988USD, $5.3million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting <b>in</b> <b>portions</b> of the mantle convecting upward {{since it is}} lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} steel-manufacturing {{factories}} in Iran. All of their byproducts, steel slag, are dumped randomly in open areas, causing many environmentally hazardous problems. This research {{is intended to}} study the effectiveness of using steel slag aggregate (SSA) in improving the engineering properties, especially fatigue life of Asphalt Concrete (AC) produced with steel slag. The research started by evaluating the physical properties of the steel slag aggregate. Then the 13 types of mixes which contain steel slag <b>in</b> <b>portion</b> of fine aggregates or <b>in</b> <b>portion</b> of coarse aggregates or <b>in</b> all <b>portions</b> of aggregates were tested. The effectiveness of the SSA was judged by the improvement in Marshall stability, indirect tensile strength, resilient modulus, and fatigue life of the AC samples. It was found that replacing the 50 % of the limestone coarse or fine aggregate by SSA improved the mechanical properties of the AC mixes...|$|R

5|$|Strong winds {{from the}} {{hurricane}} downed trees and power lines throughout southern Oaxaca. The storm temporarily isolated Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca and a navy base thereby cutting off communications {{from the rest}} of Mexico. In Huatulco, the winds blew down antennas at the local television station and destroyed at least 30cardboard houses. A community near the airport of the city was hit hard, with several people left homeless. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding <b>in</b> <b>portions</b> of Oaxaca and neighboring Chiapas. A total of about 500entire communities were destroyed in Oaxaca; the areas worst affected were Zapotecos, Chatino, and Mixtecos.|$|E

During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served <b>in</b> <b>portions</b> of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates {{fall within the}} period with the most {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels <b>in</b> <b>portions</b> of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E
