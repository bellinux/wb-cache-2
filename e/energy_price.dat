Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers.

30|$|Following this introduction, {{the second}} section of this paper {{describes}} the particular pricing mechanism that is operative in China’s energy market. The third section presents an analysis of basic economic theory focused on inflation costs, analyzes the theoretical relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>energy</b> consumption, and then defines relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> namely, domestic relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> as the ratio of domestic <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> (hereinafter to be referred as <b>energy</b> <b>prices)</b> to the general price level of the economy. Additionally, we propose corresponding models. In the fourth section, we empirically measure the direct, regulatory and time-varying effects of relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption. In the fifth section, we examine the asymmetric effects of rising and falling <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption. The sixth section concludes.|$|R
30|$|According {{to general}} {{economic}} theory, <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> influence total <b>energy</b> consumption and intensity through the factor substitution effect and the technological progress effect, which was briefly {{discussed in the}} third section of this paper. In general, rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> lead to decreasing energy consumption. Conversely, with declining <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>energy</b> consumption will increase. However, China’s economy {{is in the process}} of rapid development as the material basis for economic growth, energy demand is rigid, and the reaction of energy consumption to changes in <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> may differ depending on whether <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> rise or fall. Therefore, the impact of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption may be asymmetric. A further examination is presented in the following section.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on patent {{data and}} {{industry}} specific <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> for 18 OECD countries over 30 years we investigate on an industry level {{the impact of}} <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on green innovation activities. Our econometric models show that <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and green innovation activities are positively related and that <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} share of green innovations in non-green innovations. More concretely, our main model shows that a 10 % increase of the average <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> of the previous five years results in a 2. 7 % and 4. 5 % increase of the number of green innovations and the share of green innovations in non-green innovations, respectively. We also find that the impact of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> increases with an increasing lag between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and innovation activities. Robustness tests confirm the main results...|$|R
25|$|The major IFPRI Report {{launched}} in February 2011 {{stated that the}} causes of the 2008 global food crisis were {{similar to that of the}} 1972–74 food crisis, in that the oil price and <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> was the major driver, as well as the shock to cereal demand (from biofuels this time), low interest rates, devaluation of the dollar, declining stocks, and some adverse weather conditions. Unfortunately the IFPRI states that such shocks are likely to recur with several shocks in the future; compounded by a long history of neglecting agricultural investments.|$|E
25|$|On November 2, 1999, Montana Power {{announced}} it was selling all of its dams and other electric power generating plants to PPL, Inc. for $1.6 billion. The sale, which included Black Eagle Dam, was expected to generate $30 million in taxes {{for the state of}} Montana (although MPC said the total would be lower). In November 2001, citizens of Montana—upset with <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> increases announced by PPL—sought passage of a ballot initiative that would have required the state to buy all of PPL's hydroelectric dams in Montana, including Black Eagle Dam. Montana voters rejected the initiative in November 2002.|$|E

Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. An additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057 to $8,213 (analysis from 2009).|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{previous}} literature has focused directly {{on the relationship between}} absolute <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>energy</b> consumption, which can reveal a visible relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and consumption. Many studies support the notion that rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> lead to reduced energy consumption (Amano 1990; Martinsen et al. 2007; IMF 2013; Fei and Rasiah 2014; Li and Lin 2015). Some of these studies focus primarily on the channels through which <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> influence <b>energy</b> consumption. Zhang et al. (2014 a, b) find that the stifling effect of rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption is felt most in the transportation sector. Zafeiriou et al. (2014) consider that rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> stimulate consumers’ preferences for new energy sources and eventually lead to reduced consumption of traditional energy. However, Steinbuks and Neuhoff (2014) argue that improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in energy input resulting from rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> are the main reasons for reduced energy consumption. In practice, the own-price elasticity of energy in different industries (He et al. 2014), the purposes of energy consumption (Zheng and Wei 2014), and the sensitivity of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> in different areas (Moshiri 2015) all vary.|$|R
30|$|First, {{under an}} industry-driven {{economic}} growth model, because {{the demand for}} energy was rigid and <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> were not market-oriented, the depressing effect of rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on total <b>energy</b> consumption does not manifest. However, in certain periods, commodity prices and (therefore) overall price levels are stable, and <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> enable a degree of regulation of energy consumption through their effects on economic aggregates, the industrial structure and the energy structure, causing the overall effect of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption to be negative. This result demonstrates that rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> improve <b>energy</b> efficiency and reduce energy intensity in China to a certain extent, particularly when price levels are relatively stable.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of policies {{to reduce the}} use of energy depend on the elasticity of substitution between the various inputs and on the rate of technological progress. This paper presents a theoretical model emphasising energy investments’ characteristics of uncertainty and irreversibility that result in testable hypotheses concerning the relative values of substitution parameters and rates of technological change in periods of high and increasing <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and in periods of low prices. Estimation results for a panel of sectors of the Dutch economy show that the elasticity of substitution between energy and other inputs is low in periods of low <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> whereas it is significantly higher in the preceding period of high and increasing <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b> Furthermore, energy-saving technological progress in periods of high and increasing <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> is also significantly higher than if <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> are low and falling. The regression results suggest that, due this asymmetric response of firms to changes in <b>energy</b> <b>prices,</b> taxing <b>energy</b> {{in the current period}} of low <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> will not yield substantial reductions in energy use of Dutch industry. ...|$|R

Allegations that the party was overly left wing were also allegedly unfounded, as according to the report: [...] "Many of our most 'left wing' polices were the most popular. Polls showed a wish, from voters, {{for us to be}} tougher on big business, and policies that were unpopular with many senior business people, such as the <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> freeze and the Mansion Tax, were popular with voters." ...|$|E
30|$|Second, {{the effects}} of rising and falling {{relative}} <b>prices</b> on <b>energy</b> consumption in China are significantly asymmetric because the depressing effect of rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on total <b>energy</b> consumption and intensity is far smaller than the upward effect of falling <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b> This result indicates first that low <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> resulting from the present mandatory energy-pricing mechanism is the main factor hindering energy-saving and emission reductions; thus, market-oriented reform of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> is a vital policy direction for energy conservation; second, this result shows that adjustments to the industrial structure and particularly the internal industrial structure is key to energy conservation. However, a guiding force is necessary to achieve this result. Market-oriented <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> can effectively guide the optimization and adjustment of the industrial structure. Thus, in practice, more attention should be focused on coordination between adjustments to the industrial structure and the marketization of <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
30|$|From 1996 to 2003, {{relative}} <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> were {{negatively correlated}} with energy consumption. In this phase, the price index of retail commodities slightly declined, whereas <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> increased rapidly, and energy scarcity was evident. Rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> resulted in increased production costs, which led to declines in both total energy consumption and energy intensity. Thus, during this period, given that economic growth and the price level were relatively stable, inflation persisted, and rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> benefitted both {{the economy and the}} environment. This situation presented a good opportunity for energy market reform.|$|R

2500|$|Green {{building}} or environmentally friendly construction with natural materials, {{is an idea}} that {{has been around for}} several decades. [...] <b>Energy</b> <b>price</b> increases and the need for energy conservation when heating or cooling buildings have recently brought it to the fore. [...] This resulted in the formation in 1993 of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), which has developed a building rating system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). [...] Educational institutions (colleges, universities, grade, and high schools) are often requiring new buildings to be green, and a few jurisdictions (i.e., some cities) have some rules promoting green building. When [...] "building green", dimension stone has a big advantage over steel, concrete, glazed glass and laminated plastics, whose productions are all energy intensive and create significant air and water pollution. [...] As an entirely natural product, dimension stone also has an advantage over synthetic/artificial stone products, as well as composite and space-age materials.|$|E

Shares in Lloyds Banking Group rose 5.75% while Barclays was 3.7% higher", adding, [...] "Energy firms also saw their share prices rise, as Labour had wanted a price freeze and more powers for the energy regulator. British Gas owner Centrica rose 8.1% and SSE shares were up 5.3%". BBC economics editor Robert Peston noted: [...] "To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory. There are a few reasons. One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing <b>energy</b> <b>price</b> caps has been lifted. Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government – and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge.

30|$|Whereas {{relative}} <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> {{contribute to}} variations in total energy {{consumption in the}} short term, they play a more {{significant role in the}} influence of the industrial structure on energy consumption. At the same time, energy consumption also results in variations in total industrial output, whereas the relationship between total industrial output and total energy consumption must still be determined. Energy intensity and energy structure showed reciprocal causation, which demonstrates that energy structure optimization played a vital role in energy conservation during the sample period. Moreover, the industrial structure has a unidirectional impact on energy intensity, and relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> might influence both the energy structure and the industrial structure. Thus, relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> indirectly regulated <b>energy</b> intensity in China. In addition, a causal relationship is evident between relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and the technology level. Technological advances and increased technology inputs can result in increased <b>energy</b> <b>prices.</b> Conversely, rising <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> also contributed to technological development and influenced energy consumption during the sample period.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the studies}} {{described}} above, {{it is evident}} that higher <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> have an <b>energy</b> saving effect, whereas from a macro perspective, <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> also have a vital impact on other aspects of the economy. One important aspect is the influence of GDP, which is the focus of many studies. Bashmakov (2007) and Aucott and Hall (2014) examine the percentage of energy costs versus GDP and find that when energy costs increase to over 10 – 12  %, GDP growth declines, and when energy costs are 5 – 6  %, GDP growth increases. Another issue that this paper emphasizes is the influence of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on the general price level. Although some studies show that there is no correlation between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and the general price level (Bohi 1991; Jin et al. 2009), a majority of studies generally confirm that there is a positive relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and the general price level (Parks 1978; Thoresen 1983; Cunado and Perez de Gracia 2005; Cologni and Manera 2008; Irz et al. 2013). Some studies measure the conductive influence of <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> on the general price level (Baffes 2007; Chen 2009), whereas other studies indicate that the relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> and inflation has varied over different time periods (Hooker 2002). These studies support the premise of this study that the effects of relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> can be studied from the perspective of inflation costs.|$|R
30|$|In the {{comprehensive}} regulation path, relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> directly inhibited industrial energy intensity, whereas technological progress directly fostered {{a decline in}} energy intensity. Relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> had regulatory effects on energy consumption through the economic structure and the energy structure, where their effects were − 0.183 and − 0.214, respectively. When both the economic structure and the energy structure are considered, the regulatory effects were − 0.144 and − 0.148, respectively. These effects demonstrate that higher <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> constrained the increase in energy intensity through both the industrial structure and the energy structure. Rising relative <b>energy</b> <b>prices</b> induced increased <b>energy</b> consumption costs, accelerated technological innovation and reduced energy consumption.|$|R
