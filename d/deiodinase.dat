5|$|The <b>deiodinase</b> {{isoenzymes}} constitute {{another family}} of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function. Deiodinases {{are able to}} extract electrons from iodides, and iodides from iodothyronines. They are, thus, involved in thyroid-hormone regulation, participating in the protection of thyrocytes from damage by H2O2 produced for thyroid-hormone biosynthesis. About 200 million years ago, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine <b>deiodinase.</b> Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
25|$|Findings have {{suggested}} that thyroid hormone (T4) is {{taken up by the}} hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 <b>deiodinase</b> (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.|$|E
50|$|These enzymes {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with the iodotyrosine <b>deiodinases</b> that are also <b>deiodinases,</b> but not members of the iodothyronine family. The iodotyrosine <b>deiodinases</b> (unlike the iodothyronine <b>deiodinases)</b> do not use selenocysteine or selenium. The iodotyrosine enzymes work on iodinated single tyrosine residue molecules to scavenge iodine, and do not use as substrates the double-tyrosine residue molecules of the various iodothyronines.|$|R

The iodothyronine <b>deiodinases</b> constitute a family of selenoenzymes that selectively remove iodide from thyroxine and its derivatives, thus activating or inactivating these hormones. Three <b>deiodinases</b> have been identified, and much has been learned regarding the differing structures, catalytic activities, and expression patterns of these proteins.

50|$|One {{effect of}} this {{receptor}} is to activate <b>deiodinases</b> which convert the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3). T3 in turn activates the thyroid hormone receptor which increases metabolic rate.|$|R

40|$|<b>Deiodinases</b> are selenoenzymes that {{catalyze}} thyroid hormones (THs) activation (type 1 {{and type}} 2, D 1 and D 2 respectively) or inactivation (type 3, D 3). THs {{are essential for}} proper body development and cellular differentiation. Their intra- and extra-cellular concentrations are tightly regulated by <b>deiodinases</b> with a pre-receptorial control thus generating active or inactive form of THs. Changes in <b>deiodinases</b> expression are anatomically and temporally regulated and influence the downstream TH signaling. D 3 overexpression is a feature of proliferative tissues such as embryo or cancer tissues. The enhanced TH degradation by D 3 induces a local hypothyroidism thus inhibiting THs transcriptional activity. Of note, overexpression of D 3 is a feature of several highly proliferative cancers. In this paper we review recent advances {{in the role of}} D 3 in cancer growth, stemness and metabolic phenotype.

40|$|Iodothyronine <b>deiodinases</b> {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of the thyroid prohormone T 4 to T 3 by outer ring deiodination (ORD) of the iodothyronine molecule. The catalytic cycle of <b>deiodinases</b> is considered to be critically dependent on a reducing thiol cosubstrate that regenerates the selenoenzyme to its native state. The endogenous cosubstrate has still not been firmly identified; in studies in vitro the sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) is commonly used to activate ORD. We now have characterized an ORD activity in the teleost gilthead seabream (Sparus auratus) that is inhibited by DTT. DTT inhibited reverse T 3 (rT 3) ORD by 70 and 100 % in kidney homogenates (IC 50 0. 4 mmol/liter) and microsomes (IC 50 0. 1 mmol/liter), respectively. The omission of DTT from the incubation medium restored renal ORD Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant value of 5 �mol/liter rT 3 and THE CONVERSION, by outer ring deiodination (ORD), of the thyroid hormone T 4 to the potent and biologically active T 3 is an important activation pathway in the metabolism of thyroid hormones. ORD occurs mainly in peripheral tissues, of which liver and kidney are most important, and is catalyzed by the enzymatic action of iodothyronine <b>deiodinases.</b> <b>Deiodinases</b> constitute a family of at least three distinctly different selenoenzymes, designated D 1, D 2, and D 3. In the catalytic site of the D 1 protein, a selenocysteine residue functions as acceptor for the iodonium ion that is liberated from the iodothyronine substrate during catalysis.

40|$|Flatfish {{metamorphosis}} is {{the most}} dramatic post-natal developmental event in teleosts. Thyroid hormones (TH), thyroxine (T 4) and 3, 3 '- 5 '-triiodothyronine (T 3) are the necessary and sufficient factors that induce and regulate flatfish metamorphosis. Most of the cellular and molecular action of TH is directed through the binding of T 3 to thyroid nuclear receptors bound to promoters with consequent changes in the expression of target genes. The conversion of T 4 to T 3 and nuclear availability of T 3 depends on the expression and activity {{of a family of}} 3 selenocysteine <b>deiodinases</b> that activate T 4 into T 3 or degrade T 4 and T 3. We have investigated the role of <b>deiodinases</b> in skin and muscle metamorphic changes in halibut. We show that, both at the whole body level and at the cellular level in muscle and skin of the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) during metamorphosis, the coordination between activating (D 2) and deactivating (D 3) <b>deiodinases</b> expression is strongly correlated with the developmental TH-driven changes. The expression pattern of D 2 and D 3 in cells of both skin and muscle indicate that TH are necessary for the maintenance of larval metamorphic development and juvenile cell types in these tissues. No break in symmetry occurs in the expression of <b>deiodinases</b> and in metamorphic developmental changes occurring both in trunk skin and muscle. The findings that two of the major tissues in both larvae and juveniles maintain their symmetry throughout metamorphosis suggest that the asymmetric changes occurring during flatfish metamorphosis are restricted to the eye and head region...|$|R

40|$|Thyroid hormone-induced {{metamorphosis}} {{seems to}} represent an ancestral feature of chrordates (urochordates, cephalochordates and vertebrates), {{but also of}} nonchordate animals. Although thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone receptor profiles during metamorphosis have been analyzed in different vertebrate taxa, including fish, developmental expression and activity of type 2 (dio 2, D 2) and type 3 (dio 3, D 3) iodothyronine <b>deiodinases,</b> two key enzymes in anuran metamorphosis, remain unknown in any fish species. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} development of thyroid hormone system during the metamorphosis of a flatfish species, the Senegalese sole, focusing on the <b>deiodinases</b> developmental profile. We have cloned sole D 2 and D 3 and analyzed several parameters of thyroid hormones system in pre-, early-, middle-, and late-metamorphic larvae. Both <b>deiodinases</b> contain in their catalytic centers an UGA triplet encoding for a selenocystein (Sec) residue as expected. Left eye migration and rotation in body position were associated with a significant increase in both thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone receptors at the middle-late metamorphic stages. Although dio 2 expression slightly increased during metamorphosis, D 2 activity augmentation was much more significant. Sole dio 3 expression declined only slightly, whereas the D 3 activity clearly decreased at mid-late metamorphic period. This developmental profile of <b>deiodinases</b> sustained the rise of thyroid hormones levels observed during sole metamorphosis. No clear cut daily rhythms were observed in the parameters analyzed although it seemed that thyroid hormone system was more active during daytime, in particular at late metamorphic stages.

50|$|The thyroid hormones, {{triiodothyronine}} (T3) and its prohormone, thyroxine (T4), are tyrosine-based hormones {{produced by}} the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. T3 and T4 are partially composed of iodine (see molecular model). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by <b>deiodinases</b> (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a). All three isoforms of the <b>deiodinases</b> are selenium-containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that THs {{play an important role}} in the larval to juvenile transition in the marine teleost model, sea bream (Sparus auratus), key elements of the thyroid axis were analysed during development. Specific RT-PCR and Taqman quantitative RT-PCR were established and used to measure sea bream iodothyronine <b>deiodinases</b> and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) genes, respectively. Expression of <b>deiodinases</b> genes (D 1 and D 2) which encode enzymes producing T 3, TRs and T 4 levels start to increase at 20 – 30 days post-hatch (dph; beginning of metamorphosis), peak at about 45 dph (climax) and decline to early larval levels after 90 – 100 dph (end of metamorphosis) when fish are fully formed juveniles. The profile of these different TH elements during sea bream development is strikingly similar to that observed during the TH driven metamorphosis of flatfish and suggests that THs play an analogous role in the larval to juvenile transition in this species and probably also in other pelagic teleosts. However, the effect of T 3 treatment on <b>deiodinases</b> and TR transcript abundance in sea bream is not as clear cut as in larval flatfish and tadpoles indicating divergence in the responsiveness of TH axis elements and highlighting the need for further studies of this axis during development of fish.
