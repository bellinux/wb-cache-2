500|$|The {{remainder}} of Rome's territory--if not its nature--was defended {{for several decades}} following 410 AD largely by Flavius Aëtius, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another. In 436 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the Battle of Arles, and again in 436 AD at the Battle of Narbonne. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked Concordia, Altinum, Mediolanum, Ticinum, and Patavium, they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor Valentinian III's own hand, leading Sidonius Apollinaris to observe, [...] "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> acted {{like a man who}} has cut off his right hand with his left".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Seth MacFarlane responded to Palin's criticism, saying that the series always uses satire as the basis of its humor, and that the show is an [...] "equal-opportunity offender." [...] In addition, Andrea Fay Friedman, who voiced Ellen, and who herself has Down syndrome, also responded to the criticisms saying that the joke was aimed at Sarah Palin and not her son, and that [...] "former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor." [...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin, accusing her of using her son, Trig, as a political prop to pander for votes, saying that she has a normal life and that Palin's son should be treated as normal, rather than like a [...] "loaf of French bread." [...] Later, MacFarlane addressed both Palin's statement and Friedman's rebuttal in an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher calling Palin's outrage a presumptuous attempt to defend people with Down syndrome, and characterizing Friedman's statement as her way of saying that she does not need feigned pity from Palin. Family Guy cast member Patrick Warburton stated that he objected to the joke, saying, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be an equal-opportunity offender, but {{there are some things that}} I just don't think are funny." [...] While frequent MacFarlane critic Parents Television Council touched on the Palin controversy in its assessment of the episode, the rest of the show's content—which contained [...] "mean-spirited pot-shots, explicit language, and strong sexual content"—earned the watchdog group's [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] title. The PTC specifically cited the Broadway-style song, which the PTC said [...] "contained all the stereotypes of mental retardation" [...] and [...] "disturbing sexual references," [...] and the climatic scene in the subplot, where Peter pretends to be a psychic, which the PTC said also contained sexual humor.|$|E
