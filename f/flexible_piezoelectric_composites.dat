30|$|Vibration-based energy {{harvesters}} {{have been}} considered as a promising power solution for wireless sensor nodes due to their sustainability and reliability in harsh environments and because vibration energy has a higher power density than other forms of wasted energy. Especially, piezoelectric energy harvesters have been actively studied due to their easy integration with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated circuit (IC) technologies [1 – 3]. In a typical piezoelectric energy harvester, a piezoelectric material {{is attached to a}} rigid structure, such as a silicon cantilever, and a proof mass located at the free end of the cantilever is coupled with an induced vibration. The transducer combined with a mechanical resonator converts the kinetic energy of the proof mass to electrical energy via the piezoelectric material [3 – 7]. However, the typical rigid-body based cantilever type energy harvester has a large resonance frequency due to its high spring constant. Thus, it is not for harvesting energy from human activity or low frequency ambient vibration. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is probably the most popular material for flexible energy harvesting applications. However, PVDF has lower dielectric and piezoelectric properties than ceramics such as PZT. For <b>flexible</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> films based on ceramics, several approaches have been reported. Nunes-Pereira et al. reported a <b>piezoelectric</b> fiber <b>composite</b> based <b>flexible</b> energy harvester for wearable applications. <b>Piezoelectric</b> fiber <b>composite</b> (PFC) based devices presented a larger output than PVDF based ones [8]. Lin et al. presented a ZnO nano wire array based flexible nano generator by employing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [9]. Do et al. and Park et al. also demonstrated a ceramic based <b>flexible</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> film. The laser annealing lift-off technique was utilized to transform the piezoelectric ceramic layer into a flexible substrate [10, 11]. Although the feasibility of using <b>flexible</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> films for energy harvesting applications has been well established, the fabrication process has limitations in terms of its integration with integrated circuits (ICs), such as the rectifying or boost-up converter in the interface circuit of the energy harvester. In this paper, a <b>flexible</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> energy harvester has been proposed and developed using low temperature process and silicon bulk micromachining technique for the formation of proof mass to compatible with integrated circuit fabrication process without any complex fabrication process such as laser annealing lift-off process. The proposed harvester also utilized a polyimide based flexible cantilever with low spring constant for harvesting energy from human activity or low frequency ambient vibrations.|$|R

Free-strain actuation of the single crystal actuator at low bipolar electric fields (+/- 250 V/mm) is approximately 400 % {{greater than that of}} the baseline PZT- 5 A piezoceramic device, and 200 % greater than that of the PZT- 5 H device. Free-strain actuation under high unipolar electric fields (0 - 4 kV/mm) is approximately 200 % of the PZT- 5 A baseline device, and 150 % of the PZT- 5 H alternate piezoceramic device. Performance increases at low field are qualitatively consistent with predicted increases based on scaling the low-field d 33 piezoelectric constants of the respective piezoelectric materials. High-field increases are much less than scaled d 33 estimates, but appear consistent with high-field freestrain measurements reported for similar bulk single-crystal and piezoceramic compositions.

In most cases, <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>composites</b> use the same ceramic compositions as the ones used in piezoelectric ceramics. These compositions consist of lead zirconium titanate (PZT) with a composition close to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). This research work focuses on exploring the performance of non-MPB compositions of PZT ceramic particles in order to obtain high voltage sensitive 0 - 3 PZT-Epoxy composites. The PZT ceramic compositions (PbNb 0. 01 [ZrxTi(1 -x) ]O 3), ranging from pure tetragonal lead titanate (x= 0) to rhombohedral (x= 0. 80) were prepared using the mixed oxide method. These ceramic particles were characterized using XRD, SEM and particle size analyser and were used to prepare both sintered ceramics and 0 - 3 PZT-epoxy composites. The effect of the ceramic filler composition on the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the PZT-Epoxy composites was investigated. Unlike PZT ceramics, the best piezoelectric properties were not observed in the MPB-based composites but in the pure tetragonal phase. It was observed that the dielectric constant of the ceramic particles had minimal influence on the effective dielectric constant (?r) and the piezoelectric charge constant (d 33) of the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>composite</b> due to the depolarization effect of the high dielectric filler materials.

Most significant changes in the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>composites</b> were recorded around the glass transition temperature (T/sub g/) of the polymer; movement to lower fundamental resonant frequencies and higher values of electrical impedance minima were observed at higher temperatures. Decoupling of the pillars from the polymer matrix was observed by laser vibrometry at high temperatures. The use of high T/sub g/ polymer extended the operational temperature range of a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>composite,</b> and a high T/sub g/ polymer with improved thermal conductivity also proved beneficial. For all devices, at temperatures very close to room temperature, subtle changes in device performance, linked to polymer softening were observed. Particulate-filled materials have been investigated, and it is recognized that the high viscosities and low mechanical damping of such materials could be problematic for <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>composite</b> manufacture. The thermal solver of the PZFlex finite element code has been used to predict the temporal and spatial temperature response of a selection of the devices presented. The simulated and experimental data compare favorably...|$|R
