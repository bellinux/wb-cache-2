In 1968, he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, completing the course in June 1969. In this time back home, he also met Brenda Holsinger, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines. They were <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> a West Point football game in 1967 and married the next year. The couple would later have three children: Cynthia, born in 1970; Jessica, born in 1972; and Christian, born in 1977.|$|E

The second algorithm computes an isomorphism by <b>introducing</b> <b>at</b> most O(kl) Steiner points and has running time O(n + kl log n). The number of Steiner points {{introduced by the}} second algorithm is also optimal. This solves an open problem first proposed by Goodman and Pollack and subsequently elaborated by Aronov, Seidel and Souvaine (see [1]) ...|$|R

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> arbitrary sites.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> {{the age of}} 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children {{over the next ten}} years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E

Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, {{but it was not until}} 1984 that a women's 400m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).|$|E

5|$|Colour {{television}} was <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time}} as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 – one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including tennis and rugby. In 1979, a documentary titled Goin' Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station'.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A {{great deal of money}} was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into {{articles}} by generation. All 805Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species <b>introduced</b> <b>at</b> the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokedex and is also uniquely numbered as number 0.|$|E
