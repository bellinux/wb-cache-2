40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{fracture}} {{behavior and}} strength of mechanically fastened joint in the <b>flat</b> <b>braided</b> bar were studied. Joint strength of the <b>braided</b> <b>flat</b> bar with the braided hole was {{higher than that of}} the <b>braided</b> <b>flat</b> bar with the machined hole. In the braided hole, although joint geometry decreased, the failure mode was safe bearing failure. The calculated results agreed well with the experimental results, and it was possible to estimate the fracture behavior and joint strength of the <b>braided</b> <b>flat</b> bar with a circular hole by this analysis method. It is better for joint design that the fibers form the braided hole, around the hole, and form a reinforcement configuration with high modulus and strength as a uni-directional composite...|$|R

50|$|Braided area rugs can be {{constructed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways including a banded braid construction, cloth <b>braid</b> construction, <b>flat</b> <b>braid</b> construction and yarn braid construction. Banded braid constructions have wide bands of either solid colored or variegated braids made from predetermined patterns to offer an appealing, thick look. A cloth braid construction is indicative of a time when outgrown clothing was cut into strips and then hand braided into a floor covering. This particular construction is unique to one manufacturer, Thorndike Mills. A <b>flat</b> <b>braid</b> construction is a common construction as it's one of the easier and more classic methods. Simply intertwine three ropes of fabric and/or yarn, and you'll have yourself a braided rug. A yarn braid construction evolves from yarn in its initial state to a uniquely finished area rug.|$|R
40|$|This paper submits {{investigation}} on the tensile and bending {{properties of the}} <b>flat</b> <b>braided</b> thermosetting composites made using jute yarns. Combining <b>flat</b> <b>braided</b> jute yarns (untreated and coated) and vinylester resin, composite specimens were manufactured by hand lamination method. Tensile and 3 point bending tests were conducted. Test samples were polished and pre- and post-failure examinations were carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopy in order to analyze the test results and their relationships {{to the state of}} resin impregnation into the fibre bundles, fibre/matrix interfacial properties and the fracture and failure mechanisms. While tensile properties were slightly degraded due to coating treatments, bending properties of the composite showed improvement when coated yarns were used. These variations in the mechanical properties were broadly related to the state of resin impregnation into the fibre bundles and/or fibre/matrix interfacial interactions...|$|R

25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} {{plaiting}} the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are plaited as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with <b>flat</b> <b>braids</b> or a woven net. The remainder of the sling is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|R

The <b>braided</b> <b>flat</b> bar with <b>braided</b> hole has more superior tensile properties than that with machined hole fabricated for compari-son. For the numerical analysis, the estimated results well agree with the experimental results, and it is clear that this analysis method may be applied to the estimations of the mechanical properties of structural members with braiding construction...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used is the bull rope. The bull rope is a braided rope made of polypropylene, grass, or some combination. A handle is braided {{into the center of}} the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One side of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the size of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a <b>flat</b> <b>braid</b> and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider's hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs directly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell produces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted.|$|R

She is lying on a simple couch, with a hound at her feet; not on the side, but with the head laid straight and simply on the hard pillow, in which, let it be observed, there is no effort at deceptive imitation of pressure.--It is understood as a pillow, but not mistaken for one. The hair is bound in a <b>flat</b> <b>braid</b> over the fair brow, the sweet and arched eyes are closed, the tenderness of the loving lips is set and quiet; there is that about them which forbids breath; something which is not death nor sleep, but the pure image of both. The hands are not lifted in prayer, neither folded, but the arms are laid at length upon the body, and the hands cross as they fall. The feet are hidden by the drapery, and the form of the limbs concealed, but not their tenderness.|$|R

We also give reduced presentations for the virtual braid group and for the <b>flat</b> virtual <b>braid</b> group (as well as for other categories).

60|$|When {{we first}} {{caught sight of}} Grendon House our spirits fell many degrees, and when we entered its solemn portals we felt terribly awed and uncomfortable. We were, of course, shown up into that dreadful drawing-room, and I think papa was as much {{affected}} by it as we were; he certainly was not a bit like himself, and he stayed {{a very short time}} talking to Miss Pilgrim, who came up in great state, and in a very stiff silk dress, which rustled alarmingly as she walked, to receive us. Miss Pilgrim was small but stately, almost overpoweringly so. Her hair was arranged in little stiff ringlets on each temple; her nose was very prominent; her lips thin and rather pinched; her eyes bright and searching; she was, on the whole, in good keeping with the room, and yet I thought that, although she looked so sharp, and spoke so shortly and decidedly, that she was kind at heart, and that I should like her. And I may say I did; she was, although strict and sharp with us girls--as indeed she had need to be--kind-hearted and thoughtful, and I parted with her when I left school with regret. Her sister Isabella was so exactly the counterpart of herself that one description will do for the two; and, except that she wore her hair in <b>flat</b> <b>braids</b> instead of in ringlets, and that she was not quite so sharp and decided, although equally kind, she might have been easily mistaken for her elder sister.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the cohomology of four groups related to the virtual braids of [Kauffman] and [Goussarov-Polyak-Viro], namely the pure and non-pure virtual braid groups (PvB_n and vB_n, respectively), and the pure and non-pure <b>flat</b> <b>braid</b> groups (PfB_n and fB_n, respectively). The cohomologies of PvB_n and PfB_n admit an action of the symmetric group S_n. We give {{a description of the}} cohomology modules H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) as sums of S_n-modules induced from certain one-dimensional representations of specific subgroups of S_n. This in particular allows us to conclude that H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) are uniformly representation stable, in the sense of [Church-Farb]. We also give plethystic formulas for the Frobenius characteristics of these S_n-modules. We then derive a number of constraints on which S_n irreducibles may appear in H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q). In particular, we show that the multiplicity of the alternating representation in H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) is identical, and moreover is nil for sufficiently large $n$. We use this to recover the (previously known) fact that the multiplicity of the alternating representation in H^i(PB_n,Q) is nil (here PB_n is the ordinary pure braid group). We also give an explicit formula for H^i(vB_n,Q) and show that H^i(fB_n,Q) = 0. Finally, we give Hilbert series for the character of the action of S_n on H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q). An extension of the standard `Koszul formula' for the graded dimension of Koszul algebras to graded characters of Koszul algebras then gives Hilbert series for the graded characters of the respective quadratic dual algebras.
