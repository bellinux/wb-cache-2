5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in <b>herby</b> or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in <b>herby</b> or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
25|$|The {{ankle injury}} kept Coen {{out of the}} next match {{and he was not}} {{recalled}} to the Test team until the final match of the series, which South African won to square the rubber. In this game, Coen opened the innings with <b>Herby</b> Taylor and scored 28 in the first innings and an unbeaten 25 in the second when South Africa, set just 69, won the game by eight wickets. With two not-outs in his four Test innings, Coen topped the South African batting averages for the series, and his average of 50.50 was higher than his highest score, which was only 41 not out.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Bournemouth based Exeter Falcons riders Tommy Crutcher and Charlie Hayden {{created a}} consortium, which also {{included}} Crutcher's brother Jack and <b>Herby</b> Hayden, {{with the aim}} of opening a speedway club closer to their home. The consortium applied to Poole Borough Council in 1947 to stage speedway racing in the town and the council approved their request on 6 January 1948. The Pirates lined up for their inaugural season as members of the National League Division Three. Tony Lewis was signed in 1949 and Ken Middleditch signed from Hastings in 1950, and they formed an effective pairing for the Pirates. Poole won their first title in 1951 and were promoted to the National League Division Two. Brian Crutcher signed for Poole in 1951 and the following year he became the first Poole rider to reach a World Speedway Final in 1952. Poole won the Division Two title at the first attempt, but were denied First Division status by the Speedway Control Board, who claimed that Poole were not a big enough club to be able to sustain top flight racing. The following two years (1953 and 1954) saw the Pirates narrowly finishing as Division Two runners up and Brian Crutcher left Poole to sign for National League team Wembley {{at the start of the}} 1953 season.|$|E

500|$|On November 15, 1974, the Mint {{began taking}} {{orders for the}} silver clad pieces, at a price of $15 for proof sets and $9 for uncirculated, with a {{deadline}} for orders of January 31, 1975. [...] Uncirculated coins are like those newly released into circulation; proof coins have a mirror finish. [...] Buyers were initially limited to five sets per person. [...] On January 19, 1975, Brooks announced that the silver proof set price was cut to $12, and the order limit was waived. [...] Buyers who had paid the higher price were sent refunds by check. [...] Brooks stated that the price reduction was because of production efficiencies, the benefit of which she wished to pass along to the public. [...] Numismatic columnist Ed Reiter noted, though, that the reduction came amidst protests from the numismatic community that the price was too high. Coin dealer <b>Herby</b> Skelton suggested in 1977 that the initial high price for the sets followed by the reduction, together with the large mintage of silver sets made the public suspicious and contributed to lagging sales. On August 20, 1975, the price for the uncirculated silver sets was reduced to $7 when bulk purchases of 50 or more were made. [...] A bank in Taiwan ordered 250,000sets at this price.|$|E

2500|$|Deane hit {{good form}} {{early in the}} tour, with 42 in the first {{first-class}} match against Worcestershire and 68 in the second against Leicestershire. The first Test was a dull and even draw on a pitch that Wisden said was [...] "devoid of life": Deane made 29 out of 44 in his only innings in the game. The second Test at Lord's was also drawn, but was a much more exciting game in which the South Africans, having matched England in the first innings, were saved from what Wisden saw as likely defeat by bad light in the second innings; Deane failed in both innings. Depleted by injuries, the South Africans were beaten in the third Test despite a last-wicket stand of 103 between Tuppy Owen-Smith and Sandy Bell, with Deane again making little impression as a batsman, and the fourth Test was a heavier defeat, with England losing only seven wickets and winning by an innings. With the series now lost, Deane came into better form himself, making his only century of the tour, an unbeaten 133, in the game against Hampshire, scoring his runs in 140 minutes. That innings led to him batting at No 5 in the fifth and final Test; in South Africa's only innings of the match, {{he came to the}} wicket to join <b>Herby</b> Taylor with the score at 25 for three, and the pair added 214 in 190 minutes before Deane was out for 93, his best Test innings; the game finished as a draw. Wisden wrote: [...] "The batting of both men reached a very high standard and, coming as it did in such circumstances, was easily the best in point of class and skill shown by the South Africans in the whole series of Tests." [...] Deane finished the tour with 1239 first-class runs and an average of 34.41.|$|E

60|$|It so {{happened}} {{about this}} time that poor Aunt Keziah, {{in spite of her}} constant use of that bitter mixture of hers, was in a very bad state of health. She looked all of an unpleasant yellow, with bloodshot eyes; she complained terribly of her inwards. She had an ugly rheumatic hitch in her motion from place to place, and was heard to mutter many wishes that she had a broomstick to fly about upon, and she used to bind up her head with a dishclout, or what looked to be such, and would sit by the kitchen fire even in the warm days, bent over it, crouching as if she wanted to take the whole fire into her poor cold heart or gizzard,--groaning regularly with each breath a spiteful and resentful groan, as if she fought womanfully with her infirmities; and she continually smoked her pipe, and sent out the breath of her complaint visibly in that evil odor; and sometimes she murmured a little prayer, but somehow or other the evil and bitterness, acridity, pepperiness, of her natural disposition overcame the acquired grace which compelled her to pray, insomuch that, after all, you would have thought the poor old woman was cursing with all her rheumatic might. All the time an old, broken-nosed, brown earthen jug, covered with the lid of a black teapot, stood {{on the edge of the}} embers, steaming forever, and sometimes bubbling a little, and giving a great puff, as if it were sighing and groaning in sympathy with poor Aunt Keziah, and when it sighed there came a great steam of <b>herby</b> fragrance, not particularly pleasant, into the kitchen. And ever and anon,--half a dozen times it might be,--of an afternoon, Aunt Keziah took a certain bottle from a private receptacle of hers, and also a teacup, and likewise a little, old-fashioned silver teaspoon, with which she measured three teaspoonfuls of some spirituous liquor into the teacup, half filled the cup with the hot decoction, drank it off, gave a grunt of content, and for the space of half an hour appeared to find life tolerable.|$|E
