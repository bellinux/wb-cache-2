Drying is one of the methods used for preserving foods, based on the removal of water to a level that minimizes microbial spoilage and deterioration reactions [3]. Pears of the variety S.

With relation to texture it has been possible to deduce that the skin is harder than the peel in the fresh product, and that increasing drying temperature increases the hardness of the peel. In terms of ashes it was possible to verify that all values are similar but the value more similar to the fresh product was the one dried at 40 ºC. The sugars contents (reducing, non reducing and total), were higher for the freeze drying and the trials for air drying at 60 ºC (chamber and tunnel).

Even though {{it is quite a}} cheap drying method, it has many important disadvantages, such as: slowness of the process; dependency from weather conditions; deficient quality of the product due to many types of contaminations.

In some gloomy, dark cave, two four soldiers, knee-deep in water, are carrying the Sistine Madonna upright, slung on cloths, very easily, barely using two fingers. But it couldn’t have been lifted like this even by a dozen healthy fellows... because it was framed.... Everything connected with this imaginary rescue is simply a lie.ARTnews also indicated that {{the commander of the}} brigade that retrieved the Madonna also described the stories as [...] "a lie", in a letter to Literaturnaya Gazeta published in the 1950s, indicating that [...] "in reality, the ‘Sistine Madonna,’ like some other pictures, ...was in a <b>dry</b> <b>tunnel,</b> where there were various instruments that monitored humidity, temperature, etc." [...] But, whether true or not, the stories had found foothold in public imagination and have been recorded as fact in a number of books.|$|R
60|$|There is a dry {{bituminous}} wood {{upon the}} plateau--a species of araucaria, {{according to our}} botanist--which is always used by the Indians for torches. Each of us picked up a faggot of this, and {{we made our way}} up weed-covered steps to the particular cave which was marked in the drawing. It was, as I had said, empty, save for a great number of enormous bats, which flapped round our heads as we advanced into it. As we had no desire to draw the attention of the Indians to our proceedings, we stumbled along in the dark until we had gone round several curves and penetrated a considerable distance into the cavern. Then, at last, we lit our torches. It was a beautiful <b>dry</b> <b>tunnel</b> with smooth gray walls covered with native symbols, a curved roof which arched over our heads, and white glistening sand beneath our feet. We hurried eagerly along it until, with a deep groan of bitter disappointment, we were brought to a halt. A sheer wall of rock had appeared before us, with no chink through which a mouse could have slipped. There was no escape for us there.|$|R
