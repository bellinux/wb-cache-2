5|$|On November 12, 1995, Boeing {{delivered}} {{the first model}} with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways, which entered service five days later.

5|$|The Bakerloo line's Watford service {{frequency}} was gradually reduced and from 1965 ran only during rush hours. In 1982, the service beyond Stonebridge Park was ended {{as part of}} the fall-out of the cancellation of the Greater London Council's Fares Fair subsidies policy. A peak hours service was restored to Harrow & Wealdstone in 1984 and a <b>full</b> <b>service</b> was restored in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} certificates {{were granted}} on 10 April, {{and the first}} trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the dining car. The initial price was NOK 422, and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. The trains have four cars, of which three are regular open seating, and one is a dining car. From 15 June, <b>full</b> <b>service</b> was introduced. The company stated that the service {{was meant to be}} more luxurious than with SJ, including wider seating (three instead of four abreast) and a wooden interior. The company markets the service as all first-class seating. The trains also had Wi-Fi. After the <b>full</b> <b>service</b> was introduced, the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was still operating only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, not close to the capacity of 84, or the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} <b>full</b> <b>service</b> {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities.

An order was given in 1650 for Bayard's Cove Fort to be repaired and brought back into <b>full</b> <b>service.</b> Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted the Dartmouth defences to the control of town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and overseen by Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677.|$|E

The train service was replaced by buses during closures. Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period. By 12 March, the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened, with <b>full</b> <b>service</b> being restored on 31 March.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The additional cost included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer shape than originally thought, and night and weekend work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 million in federal funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; <b>full</b> <b>service</b> began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ferry's six {{proposed}} routes {{were originally}} {{supposed to be}} operational in June 2017, but the implementation date was later moved to May 1. Under the 2015 plan, the whole system is expected to come into <b>full</b> <b>service</b> by 2018. The system includes routes that were formerly under NY Waterway, most notably the East River route. There {{would be at least}} 18 boats needed for rush-hour operation. Twelve boats would be deployed in 2017, while the other six would be put in service the next year. The number of boats was later revised slightly to 20, including three boats that would be upgraded later.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, the North British Railway {{opened a}} line from Edinburgh through Midlothian as far as Hawick in the Scottish Borders; a further {{extension}} in 1862 brought the line to Carlisle in England. The line, known as the Waverley Route after the novels {{of the same name}} by Sir Walter Scott whose stories were set in the surrounding countryside, was controversially closed in January 1969 following the recommendation for its closure in the 1963 Beeching Report as an unremunerative line. According to information released by the Ministry of Transport, the potential savings to British Railways from the line's closure were at least £536,000. In addition, an estimated grant of £700,000 would have been required to maintain a <b>full</b> <b>service</b> on the line. The last passenger train over the Waverley Route was the Edinburgh- sleeper on 5 January 1969 worked by Class 45 D60 Lytham St Anne's which arrived two hours late into Carlisle due to anti-closure protesters blocking the line.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company (a {{predecessor}} to today's Consumers Energy Company) {{built the}} Croton Hydroelectric Plant in 1906 - 1907. The plant and its 110,000-volt transmission line (the highest voltage in use at that time) attracted international attention. Curious spectators rode excursion trains to the site, were {{they received a}} tour of the dam and powerhouse, as well as a grand dinner. When the plant went into <b>full</b> <b>service</b> in September 1907 it represented the latest advances in electric power generation and transmission. Engineers from Russia, England, France, Italy, Japan, and India came to tour the plant when it opened. The facility is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only <b>full</b> <b>service</b> restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
