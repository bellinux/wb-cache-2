Five others were prepared in longitudinal section. Twelve spindles of the superior rectus muscle from three sheep orbits were studied in a similar manner to provide a comparison. The human spindles contained a total of 90 (42 %) nuclear chain and 5 (2 %) nuclear bag fibres with the usual complement of sensory endings, and 120 (56 %) fibres were anomalous with continuous, unattenuated myofibrils throughout their length, a constant width and peripherally placed nuclei. Eight anomalous fibres received sensory terminals similar in form to those of chain and bag fibres. Most (26) spindles contained at least one chain and one anomalous fibre. The periaxial space was limited or absent and the inner capsule was often segmented and in contact with the outer capsule. Abrupt termination of some chain fibres including several with one pole missing, together with evidence of fibre fragmentation and other structural anomalies, were indicative of degeneration. Eight further encapsulated fibre groups were identified as <b>false</b> <b>spindles</b> containing only anomalous fibres; associated nerves failed to terminate in the encapsulations. Sheep spindle content was of regular form, all spindles containing several chain and at least one bag fibre enclosed by an inner capsule and surrounded by a substantial periaxial space equatorially. The human extraocular muscle spindles have lost, either by aging or phylogenetically, the privilege of contractile chambers isolated by a fluid periaxial space from extrafusal fibre activity and sensory terminals are subject to the direct mechanical influences of anomalous intrafusal fibres. These, and the other departures from normal structure described, must jeopardize monitoring of muscle activity in the manner normally attributed to spindles and their capacity to provide useful proprioceptive information is questionable...|$|R

It non-linearly separates the raw EEG signal into non-oscillatory transient and sustained rhythmic oscillation components using {{long and short}} windows for the short-time Fourier transform. The processor utilizes the fact that sleep spindles can be sparsely represented via the inverse of a short-time Fourier transform. Five sleep spindle detectors were tested on the EEG database with and without the proposed EEG processor. We achieved an improvement of 13. 3 % in the by-sample F 1 score, and 13. 9 % in the by-sample Matthews Correlation Coefficient score of these algorithms when the processed EEG was used for spindle detection. The processor was able to improve the scores by {{reducing the number of}} <b>false</b> positive <b>spindles</b> and increasing the number of true positive spindles detected.

3000|$|Sleep {{spindles}} {{are thought}} to be related to some sleep diseases and {{play an important role in}} memory consolidation. They were traditionally identified by physiology experts based on rules and recently detected by automatic algorithms. However, many automatic approaches were validated on the different electroencephalogram (EEG) using various assessment methods, making it difficult to appraised a method objectively and fairly. In this paper, we proposed a sliding window-based probability estimation (SWPE) method for sleep spindle detection. We performed a continuous wavelet transform with Mexican hat wavelet function, following by a sliding window to find out the candidate spindle points corresponding to the large wavelet coefficients at the frequencies of spindles and estimated their probabilities. To enhance the results, we used the envelope of the rectified signal to reject some <b>false</b> sleep <b>spindle</b> candidates. This was an enhanced method and we called it SWPE-E in this paper. Finally, we compared our approaches with four approaches on the same public available EEG database, and the result showed the significative improvement of our proposed approaches.|$|R
