The sensor system comprises a single LED source and no optical fiber junctions. The emission spectrum of an LED depends on its temperature. The reference is provided by controlling the temperature of an LED source and transmission measurements with different emission spectra. The entire process is controlled by a microprocessor unit.

Our pump-probe system divides an incident s-polarized MIR-FEL (Mid-Infrared Free Electron Laser) into two beams of equal intensity, and simultaneously crosses the two beams.

Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy using this technique provides us with information about the vibrational dynamics of molecules.

In human spine monitoring application, static and dynamic assessments of the spine bending are important and are generally preferrable as routine diagnostic procedures among chronic and acute low back pain patients. Many accurate and highly reliable devices are widely available for this application, such as computer tomography, fluoroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging technology, but they are potentially hazardous for repetitive use {{as well as being}} expansive for wide application. Alternatively, various non-invasive devices have been introduced, which are aimed for human spine assessment. They offer diverse characteristics and measurement performance, but most of them do not provide 2 D continuous measurement that is required for spine assessment in sagittal and frontal planes.
