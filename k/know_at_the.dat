25|$|The Upper Palaeolithic period {{covers the}} end of the last {{glaciation}} Devensian Stage and the immediate post-glacial period Flandrian. At the beginning of this period Britain was a part of the European landmass and settlement in Norfolk was just an extension of the settlement of the North European Plain, while by {{the end of}} this period it had become more or less the island that we now <b>know.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the Devensian the sea-level was about 30 m below present with most of the land becoming forested with the ameliorating climate. In the mid-9th millennium BP, with the breaching of the land bridge, East Anglia became cut off from the rest of north-west Europe. Sea levels rose rapidly and peat formation commenced in low-lying areas.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Concord, Sauer {{branched}} out and began experimenting with Vitis vinifera including Sémillon and Chenin blanc. These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties {{to see what kind of}} grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to full ripeness.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reasons were}} {{initially}} posited by media sources {{and family members}} for why Menezes may have run from police, as indicated by initial reports. A few weeks prior, he had been attacked by a gang and may have perceived {{that he was in}} a similar situation upon seeing plainclothes officers chasing him. Several sources have speculated that irregularities about his immigration status may have given him reason to be wary of the police; evidence that emerged {{during the course of the}} criminal trial into the Health and Safety charge showed that Menezes was lawfully in the country on 22 July 2005. This is mentioned in the Stockwell One report, at footnote 4 on page 21. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a colleague believed that Menezes ran simply because he was late for his job. It was later indicated by the leaked IPCC documents that Menezes may have run across the platform to get a seat on the train, and did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that he was being watched or pursued.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the anti-stall to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

500|$|Hughes then {{phoned the}} police {{and told them that}} Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on valium. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up to the bedroom. They later {{reported}} that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him. Evans had previously been awarded the badge of [...] "Honorary Sheriff of Los Angeles County", but in the Los Angeles Times, he was referred to as a “jobless former road manager for the Beatles”.|$|E

[...] Weiner said this allowed them to [...] "show Joan going through with it 24 hours beforehand, and then show Don giving this pitch that the audience is convinced is a great pitch. Then you slowly dissolve back {{to the reality of}} Don coming in [...] pretty happy, Joan asking how it went, and Roger having this dead response—'it was one of his good ones'—and Don wondering why Joan's not more excited." ...|$|E

But, you <b>know,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave {{a preview of what}} viewers could expect.

500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Well {{before he}} finally sought {{treatment}} for alcoholism, Mantle admitted that his hard living had hurt both his playing and his family.

As the years passed, and he outlived all the men in his family by several years, he frequently used a line popularized by football legend Bobby Layne, a Dallas neighbor and friend of Mantle's who also died in part due to alcohol abuse: [...] "If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I'd have taken a lot better care of myself." ...|$|E
