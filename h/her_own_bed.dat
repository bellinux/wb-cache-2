25|$|She {{maintained}} a highly theatrical lifestyle {{in her house}} on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, eat on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> or in secret, or consume dried meat of any kind or the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, the child would lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E
2500|$|Gilford {{was last}} seen alive {{on the evening of}} 11 December, when she, Parry and McLauchlan held an [...] "early Christmas party" [...] in her bedroom. She failed to report for work the {{following}} morning, and when guards were sent to her bedroom to investigate, they found her dead. There were signs of a struggle in which Gilford had been stabbed 13 times, though the ultimate cause of her death was ascertained to have been asphyxiation by <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> pillow. Within the next week, Parry and McLauchlan were arrested on suspicion of the murders after allegedly using Gilford's bank card to make a series of withdrawals totalling approximately $1,000.|$|E
6000|$|It deepened {{and lasted}} so that Harold carried her upstairs still asleep, and laid <b>her</b> on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed.</b> Then {{he came out}} with me into my dear old sitting-room, where, without another word, he knelt in the old place and said, [...] "That psalm, please Lucy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm to go! I'm to go! I can't believe it--but here it is! How kind, {{how very}} kind, every {{one is to}} me!" [...] and down she went upon <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed</b> to hide her face and laugh and cry till Ethel ran to rejoice with her.|$|R
5000|$|Vegetation is a 2009 quilt by Gee's Bend quilter Loretta Pettway Bennett {{designed}} {{in the style of}} the quilts of Gee's Bend, which uses recycled household and thrift store clothing. This quilt consists of strips and squares of fabric in shades of blue, green, brown, and cream that, together, create a large rectangle measuring 98.5" [...] x 83", framed. Bennett originally created Vegetation for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>bed.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Penguin Social History of Britain {{noted that}} [...] "by the 1920s {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' {{which would have been}} classed as indecent a generation earlier". Thus, in Ben Travers' comic novel Rookery Nook (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, [...] "Combies. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...", while in Agatha Christie's thriller, The Seven Dials Mystery (1929), the aristocratic heroine, Lady [...] "Bundle" [...] Brent, wore only [...] "a negligible trifle" [...] under her dress; like many real life [...] "it girls" [...] of her class, she had been freed from the [...] "genteel expectations" [...] of earlier generations. In Hollywood the actress Carole Lombard, who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and [...] "avoided panties". However, she famously declared that though [...] "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick" [...] Coincidentally, sales of men's undershirts fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, Clark Gable, was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with Claudette Colbert in the film It Happened One Night (1934). According to Gable, [...] "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> {{on the other side of}} the blanket [...] ". However, he [...] "gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility" [...] More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the Hays Production Code in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck in Night Nurse, 1931) had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the Depression such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.|$|E

60|$|At length {{she slipped}} from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> {{and came over}} to him. He {{remained}} rigid, his back to her. He was all but unconscious.|$|E
60|$|When Dorothy bade them good-night {{she kissed}} them all good-bye {{at the same}} time. For Ozma had agreed that while Dorothy slept she and Toto should be transported {{by means of the}} Magic Belt to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed</b> in the Kansas {{farmhouse}} and the little girl laughed as she thought how astonished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em would be when she came down to breakfast with them next morning.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, as {{she spoke}} she fell down insensible, and when she {{recovered}} {{she found herself in}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed</b> at home; how she got there she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair, which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it off.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{came home}} at night worn out, {{discouraged}} and dumb as an Indian. She had submitted to her fate, but she was mentally sore, lame and confused. She no longer cared whether Josie saw her poverty or not, {{and she went to}} sleep out of utter fatigue, her eyes wet with tears of homesickness. All she hoped for seemed impossible and of no account, and sleep in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> attic <b>bed</b> appeared to be the sweetest thing in the world.|$|R
60|$|We {{laid her}} upon <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> still robed {{in the little}} nightgown, for the long sleep that had closed at last the wakeful eyes.|$|E
60|$|Before {{they could}} answer, Miss Verinder called to me softly. She met {{me at the}} door of her room, with a light shawl, and with the counterpane from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Grey went to bed, as did also Dolly; {{but she was}} not at all {{surprised}} at being summoned to his couch after she had been an hour in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Right in {{the middle}} of her meditations she fell asleep and dreamed she was at home again in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed.</b> She seemed to wake and see her father bending over her; to hear him say, [...] "My little Rose"; to answer, [...] "Yes, papa"; and then to feel him take her in his arms and kiss her tenderly. So sweet, so real was the dream, that she started up with a cry of joy to find herself in the arms of a brown, bearded man, who held her close, and whispered in a voice so like her father's that she clung to him involuntarily, ...|$|R
60|$|While she ate, the man {{sent word}} {{to her father}} that she was found; and, when both papa and mamma came hurrying in all out of breath with joy, there sat Miss Poppy talking merrily, with her face well daubed with molasses, her gown torn, her hands very dirty, and her shoes--ah, the pretty new shoes!--all spoiled with mud and dust, scratched, and half worn out, the buttons dull, and the color quite gone. No one cared for it that night; for little runaway was kissed and petted, and taken home to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> cosey <b>bed</b> as tenderly {{as if she had}} done nothing naughty, and never frightened her parents out of their wits in her life.|$|R
6000|$|His father, he observed, with {{a feeling}} of relief, was absent from home--not a matter of {{uncommon}} occurrence, for that worthy man's avocations often called him out at untimeous hours. Mrs Maggot was in bed snoring, and wrinkling up her nose in consequence of a fly having perched itself obstinately on the point thereof. Zackey, with the red earth of the mine still streaking his manly countenance, was rolled-up like a ball in his <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> in a dark recess of the room, and little Grace Maggot could be seen in the dim perspective of a closet, also sound asleep, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> neat little <b>bed,</b> with her hair streaming over the pillow, and the [...] "chet" [...] reposing happily on her neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] {{answered}} Effie, {{and held}} it fast until the last smiling face was gone, the surprise all over, and she safe in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> too tired and happy for anything but sleep.|$|E
60|$|Florence dropped {{upon the}} stairs in a swoon; and was found there by Mrs Pipchin, she supposed. She knew nothing more, until she found herself lying on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> with Mrs Pipchin and some {{servants}} standing round her.|$|E
60|$|She {{went out}} of the room almost as quietly and quickly {{as if she had been}} a ghost; but once by the side of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> she threw herself on her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that filled her heart.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Emin had {{her first}} solo {{exhibition}} in the United States at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, entitled Every Part of Me's Bleeding. Later that year, she was a Turner Prize nominee and exhibited My Bed– a readymade installation, consisting of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> unmade dirty <b>bed,</b> {{in which she had}} spent several weeks drinking, smoking, eating, sleeping and having sexual intercourse while undergoing a period of severe emotional flux. The artwork featured used condoms and blood-stained underwear.|$|R
50|$|In Carry On Emmannuelle, the {{beautiful}} Emmannuelle Prevert just cannot get <b>her</b> <b>own</b> husband into <b>bed.</b> A spoof of Emmanuelle, the film {{revolves around the}} eponymous heroine (Suzanne Danielle) and her unsuccessful attempts {{to make love to}} her husband, Emile (Kenneth Williams), a French ambassador. Emile grants Emmannuelle permission to sleep with anyone she likes, and her promiscuity turns her into a celebrity and a frequent talk show guest. Meanwhile, Theodore Valentine is besotted by her and wants them to get married. But Emmannuelle is obsessed with arousing her husband's sexual desire at almost any cost. This was the last of the original Carry On films.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{during the}} weeks which Mrs. Thompson had passed at La Puy, the {{acquaintance}} {{which she had}} formed with M. Lacordaire had progressed beyond the prolonged meals in the salle a manger. He had occasionally sat beside her evening table as she took her English cup of tea in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> room, <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> being duly screened off in its distant niche by becoming curtains; {{and then he had}} occasionally walked beside her, as he civilly escorted her to the lions of the place; and he had once accompanied her, sitting on {{the back seat of a}} French voiture, when she had gone forth to see something of the surrounding country.|$|R
60|$|Rilla hopped out. She picked Jims {{out of his}} {{basket and}} took him into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b> His hands were cold, poor mite. But he had {{promptly}} ceased to cry. And then, as she held him close {{to her in the}} darkness, suddenly Jims laughed--a real, gurgly, chuckly, delighted, delightful laugh.|$|E
60|$|She {{was out of}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> at {{the first}} sound of his voice; and bending over his pillow immediately, sang him to sleep again. Mrs Wickam shaking her head, and letting fall several tears, pointed out the little group to Berry, and turned her eyes up to the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} clever of her, but unluckily the horse had warned the princess what to expect, {{and when the}} house was silent, she stole very softly to the genius's room, and {{exchanged}} his faded flowers for those she held. Then she crept back to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> and fell fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|Every {{time she}} looked at the neat, pure little <b>bed,</b> beside <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> that <b>bed</b> hallowed by so many prayers, and saw her boy, with his glowing cheeks and long and dark lashes, {{sleeping}} so innocently and trustfully, her heart died within her, as she thought of a dirty berth on the canal boat, and rough boatmen, swearing, chewing tobacco, and drinking; and should she take her darling from her bosom and throw him out among these? Ah, happy mother! look at your little son of ten years, and ask yourself, if you were obliged to do this, should you not tremble! Give God thanks, therefore, you can hold your child to your heart till he is old enough to breast the dark wave of life. The poor must throw them in, to sink or swim, as happens. Not for ease--not for freedom from care--not for commodious house and fine furniture, and all that competence gives, should you thank God so much as for this, that you are able to shelter, guide, restrain, and educate the helpless years of your children.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1860 Booth {{was indicted}} on a morals charge. Fourteen-year-old {{babysitter}} Caroline Cook claimed that during an overnight stay caring {{for his children}} that Booth had [...] "seduced" [...] her, getting into her bed naked and fondling her, and later carrying <b>her</b> to his <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> and raping <b>her.</b> During the subsequent trial Booth did not testify but his lawyers described Cook as a [...] "little gipsy" [...] and [...] "strumpet." [...] Cook's father testified that Booth had admitted he had done a [...] "great injury" [...] to him and that he wished to settle out of court, but was refused. Ultimately, the jury could not come to an agreement, and seven voted for conviction and five for acquittal. As a result, Booth's wife left him, and {{his reputation as a}} moral authority was diminished.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' said Good Mrs Brown, taking <b>her</b> <b>own</b> {{seat on the}} bones, 'don't vex me. If you don't, I {{tell you}} I won't hurt you. But if you do, I'll kill you.

6000|$|... "The game is {{not worth}} the candle. And yet it was a triumph to have both the duke and Tom Towers. You must confess that I have not managed badly." [...] Soon after that the Greshams went away, and in an hour's time or so, Miss Dunstable was allowed to drag herself to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{should not}} be here now," [...] he said, shuddering. [...] "I wish he had been moved before I came. I will not have this room any more; {{remember}} that." [...] She led {{him up to the}} foot of the little cot, which stood close by the head of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed,</b> and then she removed a handkerchief which lay upon the child's face.|$|E
60|$|Next {{she insisted}} upon my getting into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>bed</b> {{in the wagon}} to sleep, forbidding me to smoke, which she said made the hand shake. Thither, then, I went, after a brief {{conversation}} with Hans, whom I directed to clean my rifle thoroughly. For I wished to be alone and knew that I had little chance of solitude outside of that somewhat fusty couch.|$|E
60|$|He {{ran down}} {{and told the}} porter that she was {{certainly}} in the room. He had had a letter from her and feared a terrible accident. He suggested breaking open the door. The porter, who had been sullen and disinclined to listen, became alarmed; he could not take the responsibility of breaking into the room; they must go for the commissaire de police. They walked together to the bureau, and then they fetched a locksmith. Philip found that Miss Price had not paid the last quarter's rent: on New Year's Day she had not given the concierge the present which old-established custom led him to regard as a right. The four of them went upstairs, and they knocked again at the door. There was no reply. The locksmith set to work, and at last they entered the room. Philip gave a cry and instinctively covered his eyes with his hands. The wretched woman was hanging with a rope round her neck, which she had tied to a hook in the ceiling fixed by some previous tenant {{to hold up the}} curtains of the bed. She had moved <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>bed</b> {{out of the way and}} had stood on a chair, which had been kicked away. It was lying on its side on the floor. They cut her down. The body was quite cold.|$|R
60|$|The {{surgeon and}} ensign retired, and Warley had an {{opportunity}} of looking about him more at leisure, and with {{a better understanding of}} the nature and feelings of the group collected in the cabin. Poor Hetty had been placed on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> simple <b>bed,</b> and was reclining in a half seated attitude, with the approaches of death on her countenance, though they were singularly dimmed by the lustre of an expression in which all the intelligence of her entire being appeared to be concentrated. Judith and Hist were near her, the former seated in deep grief; the latter standing, in readiness to offer any of the gentle attentions of feminine care. Deerslayer stood at the end of the pallet, leaning on Killdeer, unharmed in person, all the fine martial ardor that had so lately glowed in his countenance having given place to the usual look of honesty and benevolence, qualities of which the expression was now softened by manly regret and pity. The Serpent was in the background of the picture, erect, and motionless as a statue; but so observant that not a look of the eye escaped his own keen glances. Hurry completed the group, being seated on a stool near the door, like one who felt himself out of place in such a scene, but who was ashamed to quit it, unbidden.|$|R
