He said <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> contribute {{as much time as}} he can spare to assisting Head Coach Mark Nelson in the development of Fylde's senior squad. Fylde won National League 2 North 10/11 and Ashton signed for Fylde for the 2011/12 season as Technical Director.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From {{what he says}} there, {{it is clear that}} he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E
500|$|Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim: A mining magnate {{traveling}} in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) {{to his fellow}} passengers while {{his wife and three}} daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a [...] "bohemian". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go down as a gentleman.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the Raffles stories patriotism runs as an {{intermittent}} theme—to such {{an extent}} that the writer William Vivian Butler describes him as a [...] "super-patriot". In the course of the short story [...] "A Jubilee Present" [...] Raffles, celebrating Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, steals a gold cup from the British Museum and sends it to the queen, telling Manders that [...] "we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely the finest monarch in the world". In [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles volunteers for service in the Second Boer War, changing his name and hair colour—he jokes to Manders that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> [...] "dye for his country"—and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy.|$|E
500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go to create an {{alliance}} between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option {{he has got to}} keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
500|$|The Season Two DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim doing impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam, Dwight noting that he is so determined to find the culprit that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pray [...] "to Thor himself", Toby saying {{that he does not}} think Michael is taking drugs, Jim secretly doing an impression of Dwight right in front of him, Dwight talking about Jim and concluding that, [...] "If that were my life, I'd do drugs", Pam toying with Dwight by admitting that she [...] "was a teensy bit high... in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy", Meredith coming to Jim because Pam told her he had something to tell her. Jim is under the jinx and says nothing, Kelly putting a customer on hold when she is called by Dwight and forgetting to return, Dwight taking notes during the conference, Pam showing the camera the flyer that Michael made up for the conference, and Lee and Gino, the workers at Vance Refrigeration, discarding a joint in the parking lot.|$|E

2500|$|Members of the Rastafari {{movement}} accused Tatchell {{of racism}} and extremism, saying, [...] "He has gone over way over the top. It's simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla {{in the same bracket}} and just shows how far <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|Cope regrets that he {{has allowed}} Amy to believe that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> marry her, having only tried to respond with tact when she pressed him. He has [...] "a {{crushing}} sense of his predicament"(196) and asks her to tell no one. In a letter, Arthur tells Cope he must end the engagement promptly: [...] "This thing can't go on, {{and you know it}} as well as I do. Nip it. Nip it now. Don't think that our intimacy is to end in any such fashion as this, for it isn't..."(197) ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and I wonder how hard <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> work at his batting at this stage.|$|E

2500|$|Arlott spoke passionately {{against the}} motion stating that [...] "It is {{political}} commitment and political belief {{that can make}} a man think that his opponent's views are so obnoxious that he will abstain from playing any game with him as a protest against what the other man believes. Any man's political commitment, if it is deep enough, is his very personal philosophy and it governs his whole way of life, it governs his belief, and it certainly governs the people with whom <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> mix." [...] The motion was duly defeated by 334–160. Despite their opposing positions over the issue, Arlott was drinking with Wooller in the Cambridge Union Bar shortly after the debate had finished.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} column, Sheldrake again {{attacked}} Rose for following [...] "materialism", {{and argued that}} quantum physics had [...] "overturned" [...] materialism, and suggested that [...] "memories {{may turn out to}} depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces". [...] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's [...] "latest muddled diatribe", defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an [...] "absurd rhetorical comparison", asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism and argued that [...] "being roughly right about great many things has given [...] the confidence to be far more open minded than <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give them credit for".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} innings, the batting team may score quickly {{to set a}} large target to the opposition. This {{scenario}} usually occurs {{on the fourth day}}'s play. [...] The batting captain decides how many overs <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> allow the opposition to chase his total in their fourth innings. He usually declares his team's innings at a predetermined time on the fourth day so that they can bowl at least 20 overs on that day and 90 overs on the last day. A good number of overs to bowl at the opposition team in the fourth innings is essential because usually on the fourth and fifth days of a Test match conditions are good for bowling (especially slow bowling), with the pitch having experienced a fair degree of wear and tear. Thus, to make the target as difficult as possible, the batting side speeds up the run rate (runs per over) till the captain declares.|$|E
50|$|Callanan {{also contributed}} {{translations}} of Irish verse to Blackwood's Magazine before traveling to Lisbon {{to work as}} a tutor in 1827. Jeremiah Callanan died in Lisbon in 1829, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> return to Ireland.|$|R
