6000|$|At this I {{was moved}} by a sudden fear for Kerner to a softer and more {{pleading}} mood. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the gray man's sleeve and besought him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two beers," [...] said I nonchalantly to the barkeeper, {{and while}} he drew them, the Swede and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the bar and yearned {{secretly}} for the arm-chairs by the stove.|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} from my face, I {{made my way}} to {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the railing to review the situation.|$|E
50|$|Dongting Lake, {{inscribed on}} the Deer Antler Temple WallRains clear and clouds disperse,A bright moon fills the river.Winds subside and waves die down;A single leaf of a ship.Mind awake at midnightWith dreams of past, present and future.Thousands of miles parted;Sadly <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the ship’s windowAnd sleep a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{intonation}} is awful," [...] {{said the}} Actor. [...] "But listen. In my interpretation I use no words at all. I merely carry the skull quietly in my hand, very slowly, across the stage. There <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> a pillar at the side, with the skull {{in the palm}} of my hand, and look at it in silence." ...|$|R
25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entrée that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> the wall on my inside banquette {{and looked at}} him in frank astonishment.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the wall, and a sob {{broke from}} me. Then, in an instant, the passage {{was flooded with}} light, and in the open doorway Giuliana stood all white before me, her arms held out.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> my gun still angry-hot, [...] And my lids tingled {{with the}} tears held back: [...] 20 This scorn methought was crueller than shot: [...] The manly death-grip in the battle-wrack, Yard-arm to yard-arm, were more {{friendly}} far [...] Than such fear-smothered war.|$|E
60|$|I stood helplessly {{rooted to}} the spot which I had first {{selected}} upon entering the room. Too weak to stand unsupported, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the table. My perverse silence must have astonished the woman, but she talked on loquaciously, appearing not to notice my lack of interest.|$|E
6000|$|The breath sighed itself away. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{my cheek}} <b>against</b> the unanswering hand, and chafed it with mine. Where now? Where now? ...|$|R
60|$|The wall {{of marble}} block was four feet six high now, and hope rose in my teeth as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> there <b>against</b> it a miserable {{helpless}} log, and ground my teeth, and watched that glorious struggle. I {{could do no}} more for I had lost my revolver in the battle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in the African forest," [...] Maxwell replied simply, as though that were {{sufficient}} explanation. [...] "Thank you, but <b>I</b> would rather <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the railing here." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus we {{gained the}} gallery. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the stout oaken balustrade, {{and looked down}} into the black pit of the hall, broken in the centre by the circle of light from the two tapers that burnt upon the table. The other torches had all been quenched.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Jean Marie, {{to be out}} of the way, clambered on to one of the cross- beams that {{supported}} the roof, whilst <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the side wall, as near as I could get to the aperture that served for a window, to avoid the smells, which were overpowering.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{possible}} that either the Indians or Simon Kenton had attempted to cross such a place where one must flounder around with noise enough to proclaim his every movement, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> {{the trunk of a}} tree fully realizing all the mischief I had wrought.|$|E
60|$|Po-Po's {{seat was}} in a snug corner; and it being {{particularly}} snug, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of one of the Palm pillars supporting the gallery, <b>I</b> invariably <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> it: Po-Po and his lady on one side, the doctor and the dandy on the other, and the children and poor relations seated behind.|$|R
60|$|I stood {{leaning over}} the gaff of the {{mainsail}} and thinking--yes, thinking, dear reader, of my mother. I {{hope that you will}} think none the less of me for that. Whenever things look dark, <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> up <b>against</b> something and think of mother. If they get positively black, I stand on one leg and think of father. After that I can face anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't I sleep?" [...] he {{retorted}} indignantly. [...] "Why, I daren't {{sit down}} upon a seat, <b>I</b> daren't <b>lean</b> up <b>against</b> a tree. If I did I'd be asleep {{in half a}} second." ...|$|R
60|$|My hand closed {{suddenly}} upon it, {{and again}} I looked searchingly around. There {{was not a}} soul in sight. I slipped the ring into my waistcoat pocket and {{moved back to the}} white railings. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> them, and, taking a pipe and tobacco from my pocket, began to smoke.|$|E
60|$|That {{finished}} him, and I am free {{to admit}} that I was mighty glad of it. There was a great tree close behind me, and, stepping within its shade, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> it, wiping the perspiration from my face, for the day was hot, and the exertion and excitement left me exhausted.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the rail, dismissing premonitions of disaster, I {{could not}} help {{thinking}} of Miss West below, bustling and humming {{as she made her}} little nest. And from her my thought drifted on to the everlasting mystery of woman. Yes, I, with all the futuristic contempt for woman, am ever caught up afresh by the mystery of woman.|$|E
60|$|Mironsac, Castelroux, and La Fosse stood {{babbling}} around me, but I paid no heed {{either to}} Castelroux's patois or to La Fosse's misquotations of classic authors. The combat had been protracted, {{and the methods}} I had pursued had been of a very exhausting nature. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> now <b>against</b> the porte-cochere, and mopped myself vigorously. Then Saint-Eustache, who was engaged in binding up his principal's arm, called to La Fosse.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my face <b>against</b> the bed, his feeble hand {{could just}} move itself {{enough to touch}} me. I hope the touch was penitent. It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak to close.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{lifted the}} three-hundred-pound stone god, {{and carried him}} {{into the back room}} of the café--the temple, <b>I</b> mean--and <b>leaned</b> him <b>against</b> the wall. It was more work than {{bouncing}} three live ones from an all-night Broadway joint on New-Year's Eve.|$|R
6000|$|As it was, {{she caught}} {{me about the}} waist as any mother might have done her son. [...] "What ails you?" [...] she inquired, her newly-aroused anxiety {{contrasting}} sharply with her joyous cry of a moment earlier. [...] "Are you faint, my friend?" [...] It needed no confession on my part. My condition was all too plain as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> her frail body for support.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the {{balustrade}} all numb, {{watching them}} depart. I saw Cosimo come upon her {{other side and}} lean over her as he moved, so slim and graceful, beside her own slight, graceful figure. Then I sank to the cushions of the seat she had vacated, and stayed there with my misery until the night had closed about the place, and the white marble pillars looked ghostly and unreal.|$|E
60|$|But {{presently}} {{the wall}} of fire rolled by and took the roar with it. Dense billows of smoke followed, and hid everything in opaque darkness. I heard the hiss of failing sparks and the crackle of burning wood, and occasionally the crash of a failing branch. It was intolerably hot, but I could stand the heat better than the air. I coughed and strangled. I could not get my breath. My eyes smarted and burned. Crawling close under the bank, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> it and waited.|$|E
60|$|I {{had gone}} {{not more than}} a quarter of the way when, finding an {{interest}} in the antics of a family of lizards which dwelt thereabout and seemed full of reptilian joy for their immunity from the ills incident to life at the Brownville House, I sat upon a fallen tree to observe them. As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> wearily <b>against</b> a branch of the gnarled old trunk the twilight deepened in the somber woods and the faint new moon began casting visible shadows and gilding the leaves of the trees with a tender but ghostly light.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1972, Gray and Smith had lunch. According to Smith, {{during this}} lunch Gray {{mentioned}} details of Donald Segretti and John Mitchell's {{involvement in the}} Watergate burglaries. Smith quotes Gray:"Gray {{told me about a}} guy who burned his palm, and about Donald Segretti (by name).And when he intimated over the entrée that the wrongdoing went further, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> the wall on my inside banquette and looked at him in frank astonishment."The attorney general?" [...] I asked.He nodded.I paused."The president?" [...] I asked.He {{looked me in the eye}} without denial—or any comment. In other words, confirmation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall help me,--to-morrow." [...] The morrow {{came and}} Lily {{was still very}} patient; but she had {{prepared}} herself, and had prepared the time also, {{so that in the}} hour of the gloaming she was alone with her mother, and sure that she might remain alone with her for an hour or so. [...] "Mamma, sit there," [...] she said; [...] "I will sit down here, and then <b>I</b> can <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> you and be comfortable. You can bear as much of me as that,--can't you, mamma?" [...] Then Mrs. Dale put her arm over Lily's shoulder, and embraced her daughter. [...] "And now, mamma, we will talk about this wonderful letter." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall}} and cried. It {{was the first time}} in many years that I had cried. I {{remember}} noting, even in my extremity, the warmth of the tears on my cheeks and the salt taste when they reached my lips. Then I had a chill, and for a time shook as with an ague. Abandoning the openness of the yard as too impossible a feat for one in my condition, still shaking with the chill, crouching close to the protecting wall, my hands touching it, I started to skirt the yard.|$|E
60|$|I was so terror-stricken by {{this fight}} in the dark that <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the ladder, {{trembling}} and unable to ascend. And upon me was that old sickness at the pit of the stomach, caused always by the spectacle of physical violence. In this instance I could not see, but I could hear {{the impact of the}} blows—the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking forcibly against flesh. Then there was the crashing about of the entwined bodies, the laboured breathing, the short quick gasps of sudden pain.|$|E
60|$|The Zulus grew excited, and {{the odds}} went down a little. The Boers {{stretched}} out their white faces {{and stared at}} me; I saw {{them out of the}} corner of my eye as I loaded again. Another vulture came; seeing one of its companions on the ground, if in a somewhat unnatural attitude, perhaps it thought that there could be nothing to fear. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> my rock, aimed, and fired, almost carelessly, so sure was I of the result. This time I did not shut my eyes, but watched to see what happened.|$|E
40|$|I SAT IN T H E BARN WINDOW. It was Friday night - {{the first}} night I 2 ̆ 7 d been home for three months—{{the first night}} for three months that I 2 ̆ 7 d seen my brother, Rog, or helped him with the chores or sat in the barn window like this with my knees propped {{up in front of}} me. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my head <b>against</b> the pitted side sill and looked up [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my bicycle <b>against</b> a {{tree and}} went in-doors. The place did not seem so quiet as when I first saw it. I had noticed a lady sitting under a tree {{in front of the}} house. There was a nurse-maid {{attending}} a child who was playing on the grass. Entering the hall, I glanced into the large room which I had called the [...] "office," [...] and saw a man there writing at a table.|$|R
60|$|How {{she came}} there I did {{not at the}} moment trouble to reflect. She was there. That was the hideous fact that made me doubt the sight of my own eyes, made me {{conceive}} almost that I was at my disordered visions again, the fruit of too much brooding. I felt {{as if all the}} blood were being exhausted from my heart, as if my limbs would refuse their office, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> for support <b>against</b> the terminal of the balustrade by which I stood.|$|R
