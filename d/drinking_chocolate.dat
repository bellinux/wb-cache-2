[...] However, chocolate {{was part of a}} number of seventeenth century palace rituals offered to visitors, as part of the [...] "entertainment". This ritual was that the ladies of the Court offered their female visitors a dose of cocoa along with various sweets (cakes, sweetened bread, muffins and brioches) and a vase of snow.

2500|$|Gin {{drinking}} in England rose significantly {{after the government}} allowed unlicensed gin production, {{and at the same}} time imposed a heavy duty on all imported spirits such as French brandy. This created a larger market for poor-quality barley that was unfit for brewing beer, and in 1695-1735 thousands of gin-shops sprang up throughout England, a period known as the Gin Craze. Because of the low price of gin, when compared with other drinks available at the same time, and in the same geographic location, gin began to be consumed regularly by the poor. Of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London, not including coffee shops and <b>drinking</b> <b>chocolate</b> shops, over half were gin shops. Beer maintained a healthy reputation as it was often safer to drink the brewed ale than unclean plain water. Gin, though, was blamed for various social problems, and it may have been a factor in the higher death rates which stabilized London's previously growing population. The reputation of the two drinks was illustrated by William Hogarth in his engravings Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751), described by the BBC as [...] "arguably the most potent anti-drug poster ever conceived." [...] The negative reputation of gin survives today in the English language, in terms like [...] "gin mills" [...] or the American phrase [...] "gin joints" [...] to describe disreputable bars, or [...] "gin-soaked" [...] to refer to drunks. The epithet [...] "mother's ruin" [...] is a common British name for gin, the origin of which is the subject of ongoing debate.|$|E
