Instead of announcing <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> and sales later on the same week, WME decided to reveal the shows in an unconventional way. Consequently, {{two days after the}} Grammy's performance, the cities were unveiled. A couple of days later the dates and venues were announced. Finally, the tickets were made available two-and-a-half weeks later after the cities were disclosed. A promotional trailer and behind-the-scenes footage of the tour were released through Mars' official YouTube channel and website to further promote the tour.|$|E
5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold <b>everything</b> <b>together.</b> He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, the path that will be followed here, was completed by Élie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935–38 {{largely responsible for the}} {{development of}} the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.|$|E

In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess Lakshmi) are described as inseparable, that they pervade <b>everything</b> <b>together.</b> Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.|$|E

25|$|The optimal way {{to store}} {{deuterium}} in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope {{is also the}} raw material for tritium production, and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D-T fusion reaction without any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

500|$|The {{last six}} months of {{production}} were spent by Whyte [...] "trying to glue <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> so it made sense as an album." [...] This involved adding intros to some tracks and other motifs to [...] "make it make more sense". Whyte created around one hundred tracks for the album and whittled down the album to a final selection of fourteen. These tracks were sent {{back and forth between}} himself and Warp which Whyte described as a [...] "long process" [...] as he found it difficult having people critique the music he wanted to release. Prior to the release of Glass Swords and any single, Whyte released the EP Sunburst in 2010. Several tracks originally planned for the album were described by Whyte as [...] "a lot weirder and more ambient", but that Warp [...] "didn't really want that".|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts. Writer Jeff Vlaming combined two additional concepts that he had developed; the first involved a lottery {{in a small town}} and the other concerned corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. When the initial script for [...] "Hell Money" [...] was submitted, Carter merged the three stories into one. Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you think it must be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode {{would be one of the}} rare entries where Scully's version of the events would be vindicated, but in the end Mulder, once again, put <b>everything</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a {{relatively}} positive review. He wrote, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' was Duchovny's nudge-nudge, wink-wink writing-directing effort for this season. [...] Duchovny did not fail to deliver an episode that truly reflected his own wit and intelligence. All the while remaining true {{to the spirit of}} the show that made him famous." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that it [...] "is muddled and frequently so in love with just being weird for weird’s sake that everybody forgets we need at least a little justification to pull <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> in the end." [...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E

500|$|Much of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} its substitution of mostly unrelated quests over a main storyline. GamePro, while praising the Land Make system, {{found that the}} [...] "focus of Legend of Mana is obscured by the over-abundance of subplots". Similarly, Game Revolution's Johnny Liu commented that the game lacked depth and felt like {{a collection of short}} quests rather than a single game, while Vestal of GameSpot noted that the game's use of miniquests will likely disappoint those seeking an action-RPG classic, and said that, although fun, the gameplay had a [...] "schizophrenic and disjointed nature". Next Generation agreed, saying that the Land Make system was an [...] "innovative feature" [...] but that it left the game disjointed without a solid plot to keep <b>everything</b> <b>together.</b> The Japanese Weekly Famitsu reviewers felt that the system was ambitious, but left the game feeling disconnected, and that the divided plotlines kept the beginning of the game from having the charm of the end.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with little interference from upper management; programmer Obbe Vermeij said that [...] "only after 18 months {{was there a}} push to get <b>everything</b> <b>together</b> into a finished game". Space Station Silicon Valley entered beta in August 1998, and was first released for Nintendo 64 on 21 October 1998. Baglow attributed the lengthy development cycle to {{the scale of the}} game, stating that [...] "it's got to be fun". A Game Boy Color version of the game—a 2D remake of the original version—was released in Europe in late 1999; IGN's Tim Jones was critical of the port, criticising the gameplay and level design. The game was also ported to the PlayStation by Runecraft in June 2000, under the title Evo's Space Adventures, although the original development team had little input besides providing the models, codes and textures; a review by [...] criticised the port's poor gameplay and graphics, and it has elsewhere been described as [...] "one of the laziest ports in the history of video games".|$|E
500|$|Though each story's title notes one character, {{there are}} a total of over [...] named in the book, some {{appearing}} only once and some recurring several times. According to literary scholar Forrest L. Ingram, [...] "George Willard [...] in all but six stories; 33 characters each appear {{in more than one}} story (some of them five and six times). Ninety-one characters appear only once in the cycle (ten of these are central protagonists in their stories)." [...] Within the stories, characters figure in anecdotes that cover a relatively large time period; much of the action takes place during George's teenage years, but {{there are a}}lso episodes that go back several generations (particularly in [...] "Godliness"), approximately twenty years ("Hands"), and anywhere in between. Indeed, the climactic scenes of two stories, [...] "The Strength of God" [...] and [...] "The Teacher", are actually juxtaposed over the course of one stormy January evening. As Malcolm Cowley writes in his introduction to the 1960 Viking edition of Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson's [...] "...instinct was to present <b>everything</b> <b>together,</b> as in a dream".|$|E
