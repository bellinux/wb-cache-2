500|$|Barbery {{incorporates}} several themes {{into the}} novel. References to philosophy, for instance, abound throughout, getting increasingly dense {{as the story}} progresses. Barbery confesses to having [...] "followed a long, boring course of studies in philosophy", and comments that [...] "I expected it to help me understand better that which surrounds me: but it didn't work out that way. Literature <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> more. I was interested in exploring the bearing philosophy could really have on one's life, and how. I wanted to illuminate this process. That's where the desire to anchor philosophy to a story, a work of fiction, was born: to give it more meaning, make it more physically real, and render it, perhaps, even entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from her}} autobiography, Bondfield {{contributed to a}} {{collection}} of essays entitled What Life <b>Has</b> <b>Taught</b> <b>Me,</b> in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her [...] "strength to meet defeat with a smile, to face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one's best without hope of reward [...] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness". In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.|$|E
500|$|Despite Netflix {{confirming}} {{multiple times}} within the month {{that there was}} nothing they could do for the show to return, fans continued to heavily campaign for it. On June 29, 2017, the official social media accounts of the show posted a letter by Lana Wachowski which announced the release of a two-hour special targeting 2018. In her letter, Lana thanked the fans, writing that it's only thanks to their strong collective voice that this was made possible. She also acknowledged the logistics of the show have always been challenging for Netflix. While Netflix billed the special in their announcement as the series finale, Lana left open the future of Sense8 past the special's release, writing about it, [...] "if this experience <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> anything, you NEVER know." [...] In August 2017, Sarandos said that at first Lana had rejected Netflix's offer of a two-hour special, as her preference was to continue with a new season. She eventually agreed to it, having been influenced by the fans asking for more. Later in August, porn site xHamster wrote an open letter to the Wachowskis, offering to produce the third season, and a few days later received a call from Lana to whom they proposed to be the distribution platform. Screen Rant has criticized the move as one of the many publicity stunts that porn companies set out to do to advertise themselves, while Inverse wrote the Wachowskis would never take their show to a platform that uses pejoratives to refer to transgender people.|$|E

2500|$|Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon. The novel {{involves}} British intelligence {{attempting to}} avert and predict V-2 rocket attacks. The work even includes a gyroscopic equation for the V2. The first {{portion of the}} novel, [...] "Beyond The Zero", begins with a quotation from von Braun: [...] "Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. Everything science <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me,</b> and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Bankhead {{nearly died}} {{following}} a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to venereal disease, which she claimed she had contracted from George Raft. Only 70 lb (32kg) {{when she left}} the hospital, she stoically said to her doctor, [...] "Don't think this <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> a lesson!" [...] In 1934, after recuperating in Alabama, she returned to England. After only a short stay, she was called back to New York to play in The Little Foxes. Although Bette Davis played the leading character in the 1941 film version, she openly admitted in later years that she had emulated Bankhead in the role. Bankhead continued to play in various performances over the next few years, gaining excellent notices for her portrayal of Elizabeth in a revival of Somerset Maugham's The Circle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} after the {{severity}} of his illness became apparent, Atwater said he had converted to Roman Catholicism, through the help of Father John Hardon And, {{in an act of}} repentance, Atwater issued a number of public and written letters to individuals to whom he had been opposed to during his political career. In a June 28, 1990, letter to Tom Turnipseed, he stated, [...] "It {{is very important to me}} that I let you know that out of everything that has happened in my career, one of the low points remains the so-called 'jumper cable' episode", adding, [...] "My illness <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> something about the nature of humanity, love, brotherhood, and relationships that I never understood, and probably never would have. So, from that standpoint, there is some truth and good in everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{is a story}} which relates {{that when}} the son of Johanan ben Zakai was very sick, the father {{solicited}} the prayers of Hanina. Hanina readily complied, and the child recovered. The overjoyed father could not refrain from expressing his admiration for his wonderful pupil, stating that he himself might have prayed the whole day without doing any good. His wife, astonished at such self-abasement {{on the part of}} her famous husband, inquired, [...] "Is Hanina greater than thou?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "There is this difference between us: he is like the body-servant of a king, having at all times free access to the august presence, without even having to await permission to reach his ears; while I, like a lord before a king, must await an opportune moment" [...] (Berakhot, 34b). Another tale states that, at the solicitation of Gamaliel II, Hanina entreated mercy for that patriarch's son, and at the conclusion of his prayers assured Gamaliel's messengers that the patient's fever had left him. This assurance created doubt {{in the minds of the}} messengers, who promptly asked, [...] "Art thou a prophet?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but experience <b>has</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> that whenever my prayer flows freely it is granted; otherwise, it is rejected." [...] The messengers thereupon noted down Hanina's declaration, and the exact time when it was made; on reaching the patriarch's residence they found that Hanina had spoken truly (ibidem; compare Berakhot, v. 5 and Yerushalmi Berakhot, v. 9d).|$|E
