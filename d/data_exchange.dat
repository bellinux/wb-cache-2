5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei {{was first}} {{released}} on the Super Famicom on October 30, 1992 in Japan; it remained exclusive to that region for 22 years. It {{was the first}} Megami Tensei title not {{to be published by}} Namco. Instead, it was published by Atlus, which caused some complaints as to why Namco was not publishing the game. A fan translation of the Super Famicom version has been developed. Subsequent ports were released on the PC Engine (December 25, 1993), Mega-CD (February 25, 1994), the PlayStation (May 31, 2001), and Game Boy Advance (March 28, 2003). Atlus was responsible for the PlayStation port, and the staff were divided on whether to make it a complete port or something new. Those who wanted a direct port won through. The PC Engine port included added story scenes. SIMS Co., Ltd. {{was in charge of the}} Mega CD port, which included additional demons. The Game Boy Advance version, which was the first time Shin Megami Tensei appeared on a portable platform, included the ability to exchange demons and items using the platform's <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> capacities. It also featured remastered music and alterations to ease the playing experience. The game was released in February 2012 for iOS and November of that year for Android. These mobile ports were based on the Game Boy Advance version, including all the port's features. The iOS port was localized and released in North America and Europe in March 18, 2014.|$|E

25|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols {{according to the}} scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> for applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific <b>data</b> <b>exchange.</b> The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end {{services that are}} independent {{of the structure of}} user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the {{transport layer}} can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP.|$|E
25|$|The FAT {{file system}} is a legacy file system which is simple and robust.

25|$|For example, {{the session}} and {{presentation}} {{layers of the}} OSI suite {{are considered to be}} included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like Telnet and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Session layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the presentation layer are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the MIME standard in <b>data</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{standards}} {{describe a}} framework {{known as the}} Internet protocol suite. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the application layer, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|The PackML (Packaging Machinery Language) sub-committee’s {{focus was}} to develop a method to quickly {{integrate}} a line of machines without concern on what field bus (protocol & media-the domain of the PackConnect sub-committee) was going to carry the data set between machines, SCADA and MES. After several iterations the approach taken was to extend the ISA S88 Part 1 State Model concept to the Packaging Industry. Later in the development process, the concept of PackTags was introduced to provide a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements used within the state model. PackTags are used for machine-to-machine communications; for example between a Filler and a Capper. In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations. PackTags can be used to provide <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> between machines and higher level information systems like Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems.|$|E

25|$|Chromium 12.0 was {{released}} on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version. Initial changes in the first versions of Chromium 12 included about:flags updates of test features, incorporating an fps counter for hardware acceleration benchmarks, a P2P API interface that may indicate future platform <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> features, an enhanced URL bar and small changes to the tabs. Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 javascript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher will be added during the development cycle. Chromium 12 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D style logo used from the project since its inception. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the history quick provider was introduced. This feature automatically searches the browser history for websites visited in the past 72 hours looking for matching page titles and URLs. It also searches through URLs that have been typed {{at least twice as}} well as URLs that have been visited at least four times ever.|$|E
25|$|When {{creating}} Bullet Witch, {{the team}} were {{pleased with the}} shift to high-definition graphics, but this and the game's identity as a new intellectual property meant they were taking financial risks. The move to next-generation hardware meant the team could include more destructible environments. They used 64-bit computing at a few points to speed up <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> and improve visual effects. The game used the NoviceX physics engine. Working with the next-generation hardware was both exhilarating and difficult, as the team wanted to create something new rather than rely on existing code resources. The team wanted players {{to be able to}} navigate large areas with few or no loading screens, but these ambitions were originally muted by the console's limited power, and it was only during the later stages of development that they started resolving the issues. Due to the console's limitations, some potential effects and touches such as breaking glass, bullet marks in surfaces like building walls, and having Alicia's feet adjust to the slope of terrain had to be left out to increase processing power for the large-scale environments. While the team had wanted to achieve 60 frames per second, the team needed to reduce the framerate to 30 per second so all the effects would run smoothly.|$|E
500|$|United States {{officials}} said that [...] "one of the few effective elements of the 's military" [...] was air defence, with the analysts crediting the SA-11 Buk-1M with shooting down a Tupolev-22M bomber and contributing {{to the loss of}} some Su-25s. This view was supported by independent Russian analysis. Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Russian deputy chief of general staff, said the Soviet-made Tor and Buk anti-aircraft missile systems, bought by Georgia from Ukraine, were responsible for downing Russian aircraft during the war. A Russian assessment, reported by Roger McDermott, said that Russian losses would have been significantly higher if the Georgians had not left behind a portion of their Buk-M1 systems near Senaki in western Georgia and several Osa missile launchers in South Ossetia. According to some reports, Georgia also possessed a battery of the Israeli-made SPYDER-SR short-range self-propelled anti-aircraft system. The Georgian air-defence early-warning and command-control tactical system was connected via Turkey to a NATO Air Situation <b>Data</b> <b>Exchange</b> (ASDE), which provided Georgia with intelligence during the conflict.|$|E
