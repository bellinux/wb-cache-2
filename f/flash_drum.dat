The IL selected for this assessment is trihexyl- (tetradecyl) phosphonium 2 -cyanopyrrolide ([P 66614][2 -CNpyr]), achieving a 1 : 1 and reversible chemical reaction between [2 -CNpyr]− and CO 2.

The performance model is linked to an engineering-economic model that estimates the capital cost, annual operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, and total levelized annual cost.

The preliminary results show that for 90 % CO 2 capture, the capture cost would be higher than the U. S.

40|$|During the {{generation}} of steam, most water impurities are not evaporated with the steam and thus concentrate in the boiler water. The concentration of the impurities is usually regulated by the adjustment of the continuous blowdown valve, which controls {{the amount of water}} (and concentrated impurities) purged from the steam drum.

Benfield Process is a chemical absorbing process by using Benfield solvent that consist of 30 % Potassium Carbonate (K 2 CO 3),water,DEA as activator and corrosion inhibitor.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{processes for}} acid gas removal (AGR), including CO 2 in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation facilities are: a chemical process, using methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA); a physical process, using chilled methanol (Rectisol) or a physical process, using mixtures of dimethylethers of polyetheleneglycol (Selexol). These conventional processes require cooling {{of the fuel}} gas streams for CO 2 capture and subsequent reheating before sending to turbines, which decreases the plant thermal efficiency and increases the overall cost. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing an economical process which can capture CO 2 from the hot fuel gas stream without significant cooling. The overall objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential use of physical solvents for selective capture of CO 2 from post water-gas-shift streams under relatively elevated pressures and temperatures. In order to achieve this objective, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to define an “ideal solvent” for CO 2 capture and to identify six different physical solvents which should obey such a definition. The first physical solvents identified were perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which are known to have low reactivity, high chemical stability and relatively low vapor pressures. Three different PFCs, known as PP 10, PP 11, and PP 25, were selected as potential candidates for CO 2 capture. The equilibrium solubilities of CO 2 and N 2 were measured in these PFCs under different operating conditions up to 30 bar and 500 K. These PFCs have relatively low viscosity at 500 K, very good thermal and chemical stabilities and showed high CO 2 solubilities; hence they were considered as “ideal solvents. ” The CO 2 solubilities in PP 25 were found to be greater than in the other two PFCs. Due to its superior behavior, PP 25 was selected for the development of a conceptual process for CO 2 capture form Pittsburgh No. 8 shifted fuel gas mixture using Aspen Plus simulator. Unfortunately, during the pressure-swing option for solvent regeneration, the solvent loss was significant due to the fact that the boiling point of PP 25 is 533 K which is close to the absorber temperature (500 K). Also, other drawbacks of PFCs include, high cost, and absorption of other gases (light hydrocarbons) along with CO 2. It was then decided to seek different physical solvents, which have negligible vapor pressure, in addition to the other attractive properties of the “ideal solvent” in order to use in the Aspen Plus simulator. Extensive literature search led to Ionic Liquids (ILs), which are known to have unique properties in addition to extremely low vapor pressures, and therefore they were considered excellent candidates for the CO 2 capture from fuel gas streams under elevated pressures and temperatures. Three ILs, namely TEGO IL K 5, TEGO IL P 9 and TEGO IL P 51 P, manufactured by Evonik Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation, were selected as potential solvents for CO 2 capture. The solubilities of CO 2, H 2, H 2 S and N 2 were measured in the TEGO IL K 5 and the solubilities of CO 2 and H 2 were measured in the TEGO IL K 5 at pressures up to 30 bar and temperatures from 300 to 500 K. Also, the density and viscosity of these three ILs were measured within the same pressure and temperature ranges, and the surface tension for TEGO IL K 5 and TEGO IL P 51 P were measured from 296 to 369 K. Due to their superior performance for CO 2 capture, the TEGO IL K 5 and the TEGO IL P 51 P were selected to be used in the Aspen simulator for the conceptual process development. The density and surface tension data for the TEGO IL K 5 and the TEGO IL P 51 P were used in Aspen Plus, employing the Peng-Robinson Equation of state (P-R EOS) to obtain the critical properties of the two ILs; and the measured solubility data were also used to obtain the binary interaction parameters between the shifted gas constituents and two ILs. The Aspen Plus simulator was employed to develop a conceptual process for CO 2 capture from a shifted fuel gas stream (102. 52 kg/s) generated using Pittsburgh # 8 coal for a 400 MWe power plant. The conceptual process developed consisted mainly of 4 adiabatic absorbers (2. 4 m ID) arranged in parallel and packed with Plastic Pall Rings of 0. 025 m for CO 2 capture; 3 <b>flash</b> <b>drums</b> arranged in series for solvent regeneration using the pressure-swing option; and 2 pressure-intercooling systems for separating and pumping CO 2 to the sequestration sites.

However, the commercial methanol synthesis catalyst offers a poor efficiency in CO 2 feedstock because of a low conversion of CO 2 and its deactivation resulting from high water production during the process. To overcome these barriers, an efficient process consisting of three stage heat exchanger reactors was proposed for CO 2 hydrogenation. The catalyst volume in the conventional methanol reactor (CR) {{is divided into three}} sections to load reactors. The product stream of each reactor is conveyed to a <b>flash</b> <b>drum</b> to remove methanol and water from the unreacted gases (H 2, CO and CO 2). Then, the gaseous stream enters the top of the next reactor as the inlet feed. This novel configuration increases CO 2 conversion almost twice compared to one stage reactor.

The proposed process was compared with one stage reactor and CR from coal and natural gas. Methanol is produced 288, 305, 586 and 569 ton/day in CR, one-stage, three-stage and three-stage membrane reactors (MR), respectively.

The production process of green diesel consists of two reactors in series. Both reactors are followed by a <b>flash</b> <b>drum.</b> The first reactor, removes oxygen by hydrotreating the triglycerides. The result is a paraffin mix with high cetane number and cloudpoint. The second reactor lowers both cetane number and cloudpoint by isomerization and cracking of the paraffins. The latter is a beneficial change, the former is not. Therefore, a trade-off in either good combustion properties vs. good cloud point emerges. The objective of this thesis is to deduce a kinetic model for both reactors, using Klein research group in-house software. The software is on a molecular level. Both models are fit to experimental data. First, a reaction network is composed. The extent of this reaction network is controlled by specifying reactant for every specific reaction and by adding a max rank restriction on isomerization. The rank of the reaction {{is equal to the}} number of reaction steps from the feed molecules. Together, both models consists of 959 reactions. Second, properties of all species are computed. Third, for all reactions, a reaction rate constant is determined. The number of parameters is drastically reduced from 1918 to 39 (98 % less) by using Linear Free Energy Relationships (LFER). Because a catalyst is involved, Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) kinetics are applied. The parity plot for the product distribution of the 1 st reactor has a R 2 value of 0. 9979. This model does not include temperature dependency. The parity plot for the product distribution of the 2 nd reactor has R 2 value of 0. 8291. Also, it concludes temperature dependency, its R 2 value for the temperature dependent data is 0. 9885. By increasing temperature, the isoparaffin content increases. At about 365 °C it reaches a maxima and starts to decrease. This can be related with an increasing thermal cracking and therefore a reduced isoparaffin content.

40|$|Biodiesel {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the effective, green, renewable and sustainable fuels. It is derived from renewable living resources either animal fats or vegetable oils. Biodiesel production in the absence of catalyst using supercritical methanol has recently been receiving significant attention. Non-catalytic transesterification reaction eliminates the difficulties of catalyst preparation and separation processes. Although it has shown high conversion for the reactants with relatively short reaction time in comparison with the conventional catalytic transesterification processes, it has some disadvantages including higher reaction temperature and pressure, large excess of methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio and higher energy consumption. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, an experimental study followed by process design/integration for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) has been performed. A low-quality WCO collected from local restaurants has been selected as a feedstock for the reaction. The experimental phase of the transesterification reaction together with an optimisation procedure resulted in the optimised conditions of M:O molar ratio of 37 : 1, reaction temperature of 253. 5 oC, reaction pressure of 198. 5 bar in 14. 8 min. The maximum yield was 91 %. In addition, kinetics of the reaction has been studied concluding an irreversible pseudo first order reaction with a reaction rate constant of 0. 0006 s- 1. Moreover, thermodynamics of the reaction has been studied at a temperature range of 240 - 270 oC with resulting frequency factor and activation energy of 4. 05 s- 1 and 50. 5 kJ/mol. A kinetic reactor has been simulated using the experimentally determined kinetic and thermodynamic data. The enthalpy content of the reactor product stream has been used to separate most of the unreacted methanol in an adiabatic <b>flash</b> <b>drum.</b> Finally, a scheme has been developed for an energy integrated process in order to maximise the heat recovery. Energy savings resulted from the developed heat exchanger network (HEN) have been concluded as 32. 2 % and 23. 8 % for both heating and cooling energies respectively, in comparison with an existing process energy requirements in the literature. The amount of heat exchanged for each unit has been determined in addition to composition, temperature and pressure of the streams. Vacuum distillation column has been designed to separate the unreacted triglycerides from biodiesel in order to fulfil the quality restrictions of the final biodiesel product...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though the}} use of {{renewable}} energy in electricity generation has significantly increased over time, coal is projected to remain as the primary fuel in electricity generation worldwide in the next decades due to its availability, stability of supply and cost. However, coal-fired power plants are the largest stationary sources of CO 2 emissions that contribute to global warming. Several technologies {{have been developed to}} mitigate CO 2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Oxy-combustion is a promising pathway to capture CO 2 from coal fired power plants that competes favourably with other CO 2 capture technology pathways such as post-combustion and pre-combustion. Oxy-combustion has attracted attention because it provides a CO 2 -enriched flue gas stream which can be further purified using a relatively simple multi-stage compression and cooling processes. Currently, there is no oxy-coal-fired power plant in commercial-scale operation. Thus, the transition towards commercial scale operation is the main challenge for this technology. The CO 2 capture and purification unit (CO 2 CPU) is an important unit in oxy-coal-fired power plants that determine the quality of the CO 2 product and energy consumption of the power plants. Several studies published on the CO 2 CPU process have evaluated the performance of this system at steady state. Insight regarding the dynamic behaviour of the CO 2 CPU process is very limited and a mechanistic dynamic model of the CO 2 CPU is not available in open literature. Thus, research on dynamic modelling and control system development is still required to demonstrate the operability and controllability of this technology. This study aims to develop, test and validate a dynamic model of the CO 2 CPU for oxy-coal-fired power plants. Detailed mathematical models of each unit operation in the CO 2 CPU are provided in this study. The main challenge was to develop a dynamic model of a multi-stream heat exchanger that involves multiple process streams and encounters both condensing and boiling two phase flows. A dynamic model that is not computationally intensive, to slow down the entire CO 2 CPU plant model, and that can predict reasonable fluid temperatures in the multi-stream heat exchanger was developed in this study. The proposed multi-stream heat exchanger model was based on a shell and tube configuration that considers only axial changes in flow, i. e., a 1 D model. Likewise, the two phase region in this unit was modelled using a homogenous model, which is a simplified discretized two-phase flow model that reduces the computational effort and complexity of the multi-stream heat exchanger process model. The homogenous model takes into account the changes in the fluid properties in the two phase region to calculate the heat transfer coefficients of the multi-stream heat exchanger models. To the author’s knowledge, the model presented in this study represents the first mechanistic process model that describes the transient behaviour of a CO 2 CPU for oxy-fired power plant. Two design configurations of the CO 2 CPU were considered in this study, i. e. the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU and the CanmetENERGY’s proprietary CO 2 CPU (CanCO 2). Both plants are designed based on a two-stage flash separation process. The CanCO 2 is an extended design of the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. The presence of an external recycle stream, recycling a portion of the CO 2 rich effluent gas stream from the first <b>flash</b> <b>drum</b> to the compressor train, in the CanCO 2 is a major distinction between the two CO 2 CPU configurations and enhances the CO 2 capture rate for the CanCO 2 process. Nevertheless, the addition of this recycle stream makes the CanCO 2 plant model convergence more challenging than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU since it adds natural feedback into the system. A systematic procedure to perform the process integration of all the unit operations considered in the CO 2 CPU flowsheets was developed and presented in this study. Stand-alone unit operation models were developed, coded and then connected together one at a time. Dynamic models of the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU and the CanCO 2 were developed and validated at steady state using design data. Reasonable agreement between the developed models and the design data were obtained for both CO 2 CPU configurations. Several dynamic tests were performed to gain insight into the transient behaviour of the CO 2 CPU. The results obtained from the transient analyses clearly demonstrate that both CO 2 CPU plants are highly nonlinear processes. The CO 2 recovery and the CO 2 product purity obtained from the base case of both plants are similar, approximately at 89 wt% and 95 mol% respectively. The operating conditions of the first <b>flash</b> <b>drum</b> were found to play a key role on the CO 2 CPU performance of both plants. In addition, both models indicate that the CO 2 recovery is more sensitive to the operating conditions than that of the CO 2 product purity. The CO 2 purity is more sensitive to the flue gas composition and responds to all changes performed in this study faster than the CO 2 recovery. Because of the recycle stream, the CanCO 2 response to all changes is slower than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. Nevertheless, {{the use of}} a recycle stream improves the CO 2 recovery and increases the number of manipulated variables in the CanCO 2, thus this system has more alternative control structures than the Air Products’ CO 2 CPU. The models developed in this study can be extended to include the controllability analysis and the control structure design for the CO 2 CPU; and the integration of oxy-boiler, steam cycle and also air separation unit (ASU) into a complete dynamic model of the oxy-fired power plant that will be very useful for oxyfuel combustion technology scale-up...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to current}} {{changes in the}} global market with {{increasing}} competition, strict bounds on product specifications, pricing pressures, and environmental issues, the chemical process industry has a high demand for methods and tools that enhance profitability by reducing the operating costs using limited resources. Real time optimization (RTO) strategies combine process control and economics, and have gone through much advancement {{during the last few}} decades. A typical real time optimization application is model based and requires the solution of at least three (usually) nonlinear programming problems, such as combined gross error detection and data reconciliation, parameter estimation and economic optimization. A successful implementation of RTO requires fast and accurate solution of these stated nonlinear programming problems. Current real time optimization strategies wait for steady state after a disturbance enters the process. If, during this wait, another disturbance enters into the system, it will increase the transition time significantly. An alternative, real time evolution (RTE), calculates the new set-points using only disturbance information and the new set-points are implemented in small step changes to a supervisory control system such as model predictive control (MPC) or can be implemented directly to the regulatory control layer. RTE ignores the important part of data screening therefore there is no surety that the calculated set-points represents current plant conditions. The main contribution of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of implementing new set-points without waiting for steady state. Two case studies, the Williams-Otto reactor and an integrated plant (the Williams-Otto reactor extended to include <b>flash</b> <b>drum</b> and large recycle stream), were used for analysis. The application of RTE, RTO and MPC were discussed and compared for the case studies to evaluate the performance in terms of the theoretical profit achieved. A new strategy, dynamic-RTO (D-RTO), based on modified dynamic data reconciliation (DDR) strategy and translated steady state model, was also developed for systems with significant bias and process noise. In the D-RTO strategy, the residual terms of the steady state model were calculated from the reconciled values. These residual terms were translated subsequently into the steady state model. Due to the translation {{there is no need for}} calculating set-point changes in small steps. The formulation of the DDR strategy is based on control vector parameterization techniques. D-RTO was compared with RTE and RTO for the two case studies. The results obtained show that RTE can lead to an unstable control if used without taking into account process and controller dynamics. For measurements having bias, the DDR strategy can be used with the assumption that the variables with bias are unmeasured and are calculated implicitly. The D-RTO strategy is able to deal with constant and changing bias, and is able to decrease profit losses during transitions. D-RTO is a good alternative to steady state RTO, for processes with frequent disturbances, where RTO implementation due to its steady state nature may not be justifiable...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this program {{was to develop a}} liquid disiccant-based flue gas dehydration process technology to reduce water consumption in coal-fired power plants. The specific objective of the program was to generate sufficient subscale test data and conceptual commercial power plant evaluations to assess process feasibility and merits for commercialization. Currently, coal-fired power plants require access to water sources outside the power plant for several aspects of their operation in addition to steam cycle condensation and process cooling needs. At the present time, there is no practiced method of extracting the usually abundant water found in the power plant stack gas. This project demonstrated the feasibility and merits of a liquid desiccant-based process that can efficiently and economically remove water vapor from the flue gas of fossil fuel-fired power plants to be recycled for in-plant use or exported for clean water conservation. After an extensive literature review, a survey of the available physical and chemical property information on desiccants in conjunction with a weighting scheme developed for this application, three desiccants were selected and tested in a bench-scale system at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC). System performance at the bench scale aided in determining which desiccant was best suited for further evaluation. The results of the bench-scale tests along with further review of the available property data for each of the desiccants resulted in the selection of calcium chloride as the desiccant for testing at the pilot-scale level. Two weeks of testing utilizing natural gas in Test Series I and coal in Test Series II for production of flue gas was conducted with the liquid desiccant dehumidification system (LDDS) designed and built for this study. In general, {{it was found that the}} LDDS operated well and could be placed in an automode in which the process would operate with no operator intervention or adjustment. Water produced from this process should require little processing for use, depending on the end application. Test Series II water quality was not as good as that obtained in Test Series I; however, this was believed to be due to a system upset that contaminated the product water system during Test Series II. The amount of water that can be recovered from flue gas with the LDDS is a function of several variables, including desiccant temperature, L/G in the absorber, <b>flash</b> <b>drum</b> pressure, liquid-gas contact method, and desiccant concentration. Corrosion will be an issue with the use of calcium chloride as expected but can be largely mitigated through proper material selection. Integration of the LDDS with either low-grade waste heat and or ground-source heating and cooling can affect the parasitic power draw the LDDS will have on a power plant. Depending on the amount of water to be removed from the flue gas, the system can be designed with no parasitic power draw on the power plant other than pumping loads. This can be accomplished in one scenario by taking advantage of the heat of absorption and the heat of vaporization to provide the necessary temperature changes in the desiccant with the flue gas and precipitates that may form and how to handle them. These questions must be addressed in subsequent testing before scale-up of the process can be confidently completed...|$|E
