25|$|As {{is common}} with Taiwanese elections, an {{important}} issue in the election is the future political status of Taiwan and maintenance of good cross-straits relations and avoidance of war with China (PRC). In general, the DPP favors Taiwan independence; the KMT, on the other hand, promotes the one-China principle and desires eventual unification of Taiwan with mainland China, as the KMT still regards the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China. The KMT's main objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> closer economic relationship with mainland China. It was widely recognized that no candidate could win without supporting the status quo of de facto autonomy and ambiguous legal status (as they did in 2004) {{in order to attract}} centrist voters. Also, in 2004, both mainstream candidates recognized eventual unification and independence as a possible option as a means to attract the center. The strategy of both sides, {{as was the case in}} 2004, was to persuade voters that it can best maintain the status quo and protect Taiwan from coerced unification by China.|$|E

Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to be able to say. For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues.

2500|$|Aggression between conspecifics {{in a group}} {{typically}} involves {{access to}} resources and breeding opportunities. One of its most common functions <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> dominance hierarchy.

In test situations, most of the conspecific aggression ceases about 24 hours after the group of animals is brought together. Aggression has been defined from this viewpoint as [...] "behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms". Losing confrontations may be called social defeat, and winning or losing {{is associated with a}} range of practical and psychological consequences.|$|E
