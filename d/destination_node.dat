25|$|We {{introduce}} four {{schemes to}} decode the signal at the <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> {{which are the}} direct scheme, the non-cooperative scheme, the cooperative scheme and the adaptive scheme. Except the direct scheme, the <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> uses the relayed signal in all other schemes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} phase, the relay can {{transmit}} its received {{signal to the}} <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> except the direct transmission mode.|$|E
25|$|While the {{advantage}} of the direct scheme is its simplicity in terms of the decoding processing, the received signal power can be severely low if the distance between the source node and the <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> is large. Thus, in the following we consider non-cooperative scheme which exploits signal relaying to improve the signal quality.|$|E
30|$|Saturated power {{increasing}} at {{larger number}} of destination nodes: When in smaller number of <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> (e.g., 100 to 200 nodes), the transmission power is almost linearly increasing. When the number of <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> {{are close to the}} broadcasting case (e.g., 1, 900 to 2, 000 nodes), the transmission power will be saturated to an upper value especially in high SNR requirements (i.e., 64 QAM modulation). It is intuitive to have this result at {{larger number of}} <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> since most of the nodes in the network are transmitted at the maximum power so that the <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> could meet the SNR requirements.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} two hop networks with multiple source, relay and <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> In particular, we investigate systems with different processing capabilities at the relay and <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> We derive new closed-form outage probability expressions when zero forcing processing is {{used at the}} i) relay, ii) relay and destination and iii) <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> only. Our results indicate significant decreases in outage probability for certain node configurations. We confirm our results through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that cooperative diversity can increase the diversity gain {{at the cost of}} losing the wireless resource such as frequency, time and power resources for the relaying phase. Wireless resources are wasted since the relay node uses wireless resources to relay the signal from the source to the <b>destination</b> <b>node.</b> Hence, it is important to remark that there is trade-off between the diversity gain and the waste of the spectrum resource in cooperative diversity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Challenging {{issue in}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is {{assessment}} {{of energy and}} lifetime at different nodes within the networks. Various methods may be employed to improve lifetime (reduce energy consumption). One such method involves balancing loads on nodes when data is being transmitted from source to <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> Multi-path routing techniques {{can be used for}} this purpose. In these techniques no global information is available regard the path, making it difficult to create multi-path routes from sources <b>nodes</b> to <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> Another problem with these networks is a routing applied to source nodes independently from that applied used for <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> This creates energy loss and reduces lifetime. To overcome this problem, the present paper makes use of clustering by selecting virtual nodes to gather information from sources and sending it to <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> The New Protocol for Enhancing Nods Lifetime (PENL) is implemented through NS- 2...|$|R

40|$|In {{wireless}} ad hoc networks, protecting {{source and}} <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> location privacy is a challenging task due to malicious traffic analysis and privacy attacks. Existing solutions, such as incorporating fake source destination pairs in the network, provide some privacy of real source and <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> against attackers. Moreover, ad hoc networks need stronger privacy protection against powerful global attacker which has knowledge of overall network topology and, {{that can also}} eavesdrop and visualize network wide data transmissions. In this paper, we present a novel privacy technique, (EXTROUT) Route Extrapolation to camouflage the real source and <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> along an extended path in an ad hoc network. We demonstrate that the privacy level achieved with EXTROUT is higher and more effective against a global attacker, when compared to fake source <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> privacy scheme.

30|$|The system {{scenario}} and {{the system}} model are introduced in this section. A source node has packets {{that need to be}} delivered to different destinations. There are multiple relay nodes, some of which might have better channels to the destination than the channel between the source and the destination. After the source broadcasts the packets, some packets may not reach their <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> successfully, and it is needed to retransmit the missing packets. Since some <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> overhear the packets which are sent to other <b>destination</b> <b>nodes,</b> network coding can be effective in this scenario. With network coding and relay selection, the best intermediate node for retransmission is selected.|$|R
50|$|A {{multicast}} session {{requires a}} “point-to-multipoint” connection {{from a source}} <b>node</b> to multiple <b>destination</b> <b>nodes.</b> The source node {{is known as the}} root. The <b>destination</b> <b>nodes</b> are known as leaves. In the modern era, it is important to protect multicast connections in an optical mesh network. Recently, multicast applications have gained popularity as they are important to protecting critical sessions against failures such as fiber cuts, hardware faults, and natural disasters.|$|R

50|$|A {{source node}} (DANP) sends {{simultaneously}} {{two copies of}} a frame, one over each port. The two frames travel through their respective LANs until they reach a <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> (DANP) with a certain time skew. The <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> accepts the first frame of a pair and discards the second (if it arrives). Therefore, {{as long as one}} LAN is operational, the destination application always receives one frame. PRP provides zero-time recovery and allows to check the redundancy continuously to detect lurking failures.|$|E
50|$|WRP, {{similar to}} Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing (DSDV), {{inherits}} {{the properties of}} the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. To counter the count-to-infinity problem and to enable faster convergence, it employs a unique method of maintaining information regarding the shortest distance to every <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> in the network and the penultimate hop node on the path to every <b>destination</b> <b>node.</b> Since WRP, like DSDV, maintains an up-to-date view of the network, every node has a readily available route to every <b>destination</b> <b>node</b> in the network. It differs from DSDV in table maintenance and in the update procedures. While DSDV maintains only one topology table, WRP uses a set of tables to maintain more accurate information. The tables that are maintained by a node are the following: distance table (DT), routing table (RT), link cost table (LCT), and a message retransmission list (MRL).|$|E
