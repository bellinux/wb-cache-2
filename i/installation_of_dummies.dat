40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in 2015 in the setting up of the multi-turn extraction (MTE) in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). A key ingredient in this novel extraction technique is the beam splitting in transverse phase space. This manipulation is based on adiabatic trapping in stable islands of transverse phase space and requires mastering a number of devices in the PS ring. In addition, an in-depth review of all fast extractions schemes in the PS had been required due to the development and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dummy</b> septum to shield the actual magnetic septum. In this paper, the current performance of the beam splitting and of the extraction including the shadowing effect is presented. Future lines of development will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Following a {{successful}} commissioning period, the multiturn extraction (MTE) at the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) {{has been applied}} for the fixed-target physics programme at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) since September 2015. This exceptional extraction technique was proposed to replace the long-serving continuous transfer (CT) extraction, which has the drawback of inducing high activation in the ring. MTE exploits the principles of nonlinear beam dynamics to perform loss-free beam splitting in the horizontal phase space. Over multiple turns, the resulting beamlets are then transferred to the downstream accelerator. The operational deployment of MTE was rendered possible by the full understanding and mitigation of different hardware limitations and by redesigning the extraction trajectories and nonlinear optics, which was required due to the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dummy</b> septum to reduce the activation of the magnetic extraction septum. This paper focuses on these key features {{including the use of}} the transverse damper and the septum shadowing, which allowed a transition from the MTE study to a mature operational extraction scheme...|$|R
40|$|High {{activation}} of the magnetic extraction septum of the CERN PS machine was observed due to the losses of the continuous beam extracted via the Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) method. The resulting activation is however incompatible with safe operation so a mitigation measure was required and found, namely the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a passive <b>dummy</b> septum to protect the actual one seems to provide the required reduction in activation in the extraction area. The shielded dummy septum is intended to absorb particles during the rise time of the MTE extraction kickers, avoiding the beam impact on the blade of the active magnetic extraction septum. The principle of the proposed modifications of the PS layout will be presented together with the studies aimed at finalising the new configuration...|$|R

30|$|TR {{technique}} {{is one of}} the promising approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems[5, 23 – 25], where the transmitter mitigates the PAPR problem by sending dummy symbols (i.e., symbols not conveying information) in some reserved subcarriers[26].

However, one problem with TR techniques lies on the computationally efficient determination <b>of</b> <b>dummy</b> symbols that effectively minimizes the PAPR[23].

We measured burial depth and visibility <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> equipped with two different brands of avalanche airbags (ABS and Snowpulse), the avalanche ball and <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> with no additional equipment. The burial depth <b>of</b> <b>dummies</b> equipped with an airbag was significantly lower compared to dummies which carried an avalanche ball or no additional equipment. Moreover, based on a qualitative validation the airbag systems were rated better than dummies without airbag. Both brands of airbags and the avalanche ball were visible in all cases {{on the surface of}} the avalanche deposits – partly due to the avalanche size and the path topography.
