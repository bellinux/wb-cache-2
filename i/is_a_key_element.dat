5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Common ways to {{implement}} the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing 'good citizenship' and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element.</b> Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E

5|$|The program {{originally}} focused {{almost exclusively}} on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

25|$|Accurate secondary-structure {{prediction}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in {{the prediction}} of tertiary structure, {{in all but the}} simplest (homology modeling) cases. For example, a confidently predicted pattern of six secondary structure elements βαββαβ is the signature of a ferredoxin fold.|$|E
25|$|A {{landscape}} with structure and pattern implies {{that it has}} spatial heterogeneity, or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape. Heterogeneity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of landscape ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{shipping}} industry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of Greek {{economic activity}} {{dating back to}} ancient times. Today, shipping {{is one of the}} country's most important industries. It accounts for 4.5% of GDP, employs about 160,000 people (4% of the workforce), and represents ⅓ of the country's trade deficit.|$|E

25|$|Communication <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of {{negotiation}}. Effective negotiation {{requires that}} participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is {{better equipped to}} interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.|$|E

25|$|Shakespeare's writing (especially his plays) also feature {{extensive}} wordplay {{in which}} double entendres and rhetorical flourishes are repeatedly used. Humour <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> {{in all of}} Shakespeare's plays. Although {{a large amount of}} his comical talent is evident in his comedies, some of the most entertaining scenes and characters are found in tragedies such as Hamlet and histories such as Henry IV, Part 1. Shakespeare's humour was largely influenced by Plautus.|$|E
25|$|A {{hydrogen}} vehicle is {{a vehicle that}} uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of a proposed hydrogen economy.|$|E

Sally, a larger-than-life {{character}} with outrageous {{clothes and a}} sizable red coiffure, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> in both comedic and dramatic story-lines, {{with the help of}} ditzy receptionist Darla Einstein, and fashion designer Clarke Garrison, who fathered CJ Garrison, Sally's son. Though, at first, Sally and Stephanie Forrester are bitter enemies, in later years, they develop a friendship; Sally even ends up working at Forrester Creations after she finally makes the decision to shut down her own company.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} types of ribbed vault, the first known examples {{are found in the}} Great Mosque of Córdoba in the 10th century. Rather than meeting {{in the center of the}} dome, the ribs characteristically intersect one another off-center, forming an empty polygonal space in the center. Geometry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the designs, with the octagon being perhaps the most popular shape used. Whether the arches are structural or purely decorative remains a matter of debate. The type may have an eastern origin, although the issue is also unsettled. Examples are found in Spain, North Africa, Armenia, Iran, France, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Placement of {{the sample}} stage {{into one of the}} {{interferometer}}'s arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak near-field signal due to interference with the strong reference field, helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude s and phase φ spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for soft matter samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), φ directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional absorption spectra {{of the sample}} material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.|$|E
500|$|Passing is a {{novel by}} American author Nella Larsen, first {{published}} in 1929. Set primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s, the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friends—Clare Kendry and Irene Redfield—and their increasing fascination with each other's lives. The title refers {{to the practice of}} racial [...] "passing", and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>element</b> of the novel; Clare Kendry's attempt to pass as white for her husband, John (Jack) Bellew, is its most significant depiction in the novel, and a catalyst for the tragic events.|$|E
