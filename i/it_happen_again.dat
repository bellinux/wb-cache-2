25|$|In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted {{unanimously}} to erect a memorial for the ‘comfort women’ of World War II. The memorial itself would stand {{as a reminder that}} the event did in fact happen, despite repeated denials by the Japanese government, {{and it would be a}} reminder never to let another atrocity like <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> However some Japanese members of the community showed concerns over the memorial, believing that it would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community. One of these critics was Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, a large city in Japan. Hashimoto claims in his letter written to the Board of Supervisors that the memorial should be “broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world”. Japanese residents of the area have also shown concerns over the memorial as many believe that it projects hatred towards the Japanese and focuses solely on an event in committed by the Japanese during wartime instead of promoting awareness and future prevention.|$|E
