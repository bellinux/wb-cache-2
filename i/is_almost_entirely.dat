5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E

Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to {{in the shape of}} ritual offerings, symbolizing the Blood of Christ and the Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous chalchihuite.|$|E

The Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal forms its northeastern and northwestern boundaries.

As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, {{as may be}} seen on the Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E

Median income is slightly higher than the country's average and {{the unemployment rate is}} slightly lower.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E

The opera <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> set inside Samson's prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera Samson and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire {{in which the}} entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E
5|$|P. d. bactrianus Zarudny and Kudashev, 1916, {{described}} from Tashkent, {{is found}} in southern Kazakhstan to the Tian Shan and northern Iran and Afghanistan. It intergrades with persicus in Baluchistan and with indicus across central Afghanistan. Unlike most other house sparrow subspecies, it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> migratory, wintering in the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. It {{is found in}} open country rather than in settlements, which are occupied by the Eurasian tree sparrow in its range. There is an exceptional record from Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Tacitus' major {{historical}} works, including The Histories and Agricola's biography, {{were all}} written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, {{the part of}} Tacitus' Histories dealing with {{the reign of the}} Flavian dynasty <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.|$|E

Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E

Nearly all {{the woodwork}} and decoration {{in this area}} dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E

The population <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> native to England—94.9 percent of residents are of white British ethnicity, well above the England and Wales average of 80.5 percent. The average price of a detached house on Portland in 2010 was £194,200; terraced houses are cheaper, at £149,727, and an apartment or maisonette costs £110,500.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} and popular green space is Póvoa de Varzim City Park, an urban park hosting leisure activities. It <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> landscaped including hills, a large island, a lake, ponds and a stream. The city park and other minor parks in Póvoa de Varzim were designed by Sidónio Pardal, a well-known Portuguese landscape architect. It also includes great lawn areas, rustic buildings, amphitheatres and playground structures. It is a popular place for jogging, cycling and birdwatching. It stretches from the A28 motorway to Pedreira Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster, Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster, is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> {{surrounded}} by water; the Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, {{which opened in}} 1894, its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic, so {{in the early days}} the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. British Westinghouse was the first major company to move in, and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000workers then employed in the park, which {{became one of the most}} important engineering facilities in Britain.|$|E
