25|$|A {{lump-sum}} tax <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> {{that is a}} fixed amount, {{no matter}} the change in circumstance of the taxed entity.

25|$|An {{income tax}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> imposed on {{individuals}} or entities (taxpayers) that varies with their respective income or profits (taxable income). Many jurisdictions refer to income tax on business entities as companies tax or corporate tax.

Most jurisdictions exempt locally organized charitable organizations from tax.|$|E

25|$|An {{expatriation}} tax <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> {{on individuals}} who renounce their citizenship or residence. The tax is often imposed {{based on a}} deemed disposition of all the individual's property. One example is the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act, where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|A poll tax, {{also called}} {{a per capita}} tax, or {{capitation}} tax, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> that levies a set amount per individual. It {{is an example of}} the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11–16) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the 'Poll Tax Riots'.|$|E
500|$|As of January 1, 2016, Massachusetts has a {{flat-rate}} {{personal income}} tax of 5.1%, after a 2002 voter referendum to eventually lower the rate to 5.0% as amended by the legislature.
