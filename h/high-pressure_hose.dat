500|$|In {{the next}} stage, by 1853, {{hydraulic}} mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the goldfields. In a modern style of hydraulic mining first developed in California, and later used around the world, a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> directed a powerful stream or {{jet of water}} at gold-bearing gravel beds. The loosened gravel and gold would then pass over sluices, with the gold settling to the bottom where it was collected.

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of a tense period and {{following}} the accidental death of an 11-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of La Courneuve in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out [...] "with a Kärcher" [...] (a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose).</b> Two days before the 2005 Paris riots he referred to young criminals of nearby housing projects as [...] "" [...] ("thugs") and [...] "", a slang term which can be translated into English as [...] "rabble", [...] "scum" [...] or [...] "riff-raff", in answer to resident who addressed Sarkozy with [...] "Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille?" [...] ("When will you rid us of these ?") The French Communist Party publication, L'Humanité, branded this language as inappropriate. Following Sarkozy's use of the word racaille many people in the banlieues identified him as a politician of the far right. His period as Interior Minister saw the use of police as shock troops in the [...] "banlieues", and a police [...] "raid" [...] on the suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in October 2005 led to two boys being electrocuted in a power sub-station. The riots began that night.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 2 [...] "Medium" [...] {{appliance}} {{is used in}} both {{urban and}} rural areas. It has the same features as the Type 1, but has an additional <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> reel and around 1.3 m2 extra locker space. New appliances are typically built on Iveco Eurocargo chassis.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire hose}} (or firehose) is a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> that carries water or other fire {{retardant}} (such as foam) to a fire to extinguish it. Outdoors, it attaches either to a fire engine or a fire hydrant. Indoors, it can permanently attach to a building's standpipe or plumbing system.|$|E
50|$|The Old City Special Services District has {{a program}} of {{sidewalk}} cleaning with uniformed crews to vacuum the sidewalks every morning, and to sweep and clean sidewalks by <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> during the day. These uniformed crews also remove graffiti from buildings, poles and signs. The District also encourages and responds to complaints about graffiti from the public. The Philadelphia Streets Department cleans the cart-ways from curb line to curb line and empties the public trash receptacles.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{significant}} test of Falcón's mettle {{as chief of}} police was the Tenants' Strike of 1907. Falcón initiated dialogue with strike organizers, who were mainly women and whose demands centered around rising rents and deteriorating conditions in the city's estimated 2,000 tenements. Ultimately, however, talks broke down, and protests associated with the strike was quelled {{with the use of}} mounted police armed with sabres. Rent strikers themselves were evicted from their homes in July (a winter month in the Southern Hemisphere) with the use of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> and cold water.|$|R
50|$|The oil spilled {{from the}} Tanio was of low toxicity; thus, {{environmental}} effects were somewhat mitigated. Nevertheless, about 1,700 dead birds were found, oyster beds were contaminated, and the seaweed harvest was disrupted.Further contamination was mainly {{due to a}} speedy and thorough cleanup process. Within two months of the disaster, cleanup had switched removing oil with skimmers and pumps {{to the use of}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> in rocky areas. In addition, cleanup was not restricted to tourist areas and collection areas, but also included efforts to clean removed or isolated areas, as well as locations where a relatively quick natural cleanup could be expected.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 3 [...] "Heavy" [...] {{appliance}} is used {{in urban}} areas. It has a mid-mounted 3800 L/min pump with two <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> reels, and a 1400 L onboard water tank. Since 2015, new appliances have typicallybeen built on MAN TGM chassis; prior to this they were typically built on Scania P-series chassis.|$|E
50|$|The kelly hose is the flexible, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> {{connected}} {{from the}} standpipe to a gooseneck pipe on a swivel above the kelly {{and allows the}} free vertical movement of the kelly while facilitating {{the flow of the}} drilling fluid down the drill string. It generally is of steel-reinforced rubber construction but also assemblies of Chiksan steel pipe and swivels are used.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, the LFB {{announced}} {{they would be}} replacing the older-generation (currently used) Mercedes-Benz Atego pump appliances with brand new Mercedes-Benz Ategos which include new features such as: an improved 'crew cab' for the comfort and safety of firefighters, new <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> which can deliver twice as much water as previous models, a brand new electronically-controlled pump, and a more economical and environment-friendly EURO VI engine, which will be compatible with London's low-emission zones. In 2017, 52 initial appliance orders are being rolled out across London ready for operational use, replacing the older 2002-2004 pumps, and later replacing the newer 2006-2008 pumps. The primary reason for {{the replacement of the}} older Ategos was due to their age (some being 15 years old) and poor economy.|$|R
5000|$|Today, pirates {{armed with}} {{automatic}} weapons and rocket propelled grenades use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that {{takes advantage of}} the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships. They also use larger vessels, known as [...] "mother ships", to supply the smaller motorboats. The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice, as these attacks often occur in international waters.Also, a number of nations have used their naval forces to protect private ships from pirate attacks and pursue pirates. As well, some private vessels are taking steps to defend their vessels and their crews from piracy, such as using armed security guards, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> or sound cannons to repel boarders, or using radar to avoid potential threats.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{pressure}} washer {{consists of a}} motor (either electric, internal combustion, pneumatic or hydraulic) that drives a high-pressure water pump, a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hose</b> and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of water, a {{pressure washer}} creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements.|$|E

50|$|Local {{residents}} {{became aware}} of the site by the early 1960s, at which time collectors were finding projectile points on the beach; however, it was first published in 1982. Between these years, the site was greatly damaged by human activity: some intentionally, and some unintentionally. Realizing that large numbers of artifacts were buried under the soil, some individuals began to dig with shovels {{on the side of the}} alluvial deposits, while others brought <b>high-pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> to wash away the top of the deposits. By the time that professional archaeologists discovered the site in the early 1980s, extensive vandalism had removed large amounts of soil and large numbers of artifacts. Moreover, changes in 1974 to the management of the Cannelton Locks and Dam, downstream from the site, caused the water level to rise, eroding the riverbank rapidly. By the mid-1990s, the riverbank had eroded more than 20 m from its previous location.|$|R
