40|$|To {{promote the}} early onset of {{lactation}} by frequent breast stimulation. To discourage {{the use of}} devices that interfere {{with the establishment of}} breastfeeding To nurture a mother’s confidence in her ability to breastfeed. KEY POINTS 1. Dummies should not be promoted during the initiation of breastfeeding. The need to suck is very strong in babies and this will be satisfied primarily at the breast. A dummy should not be used as a substitute for the breast. 2. Infants who use pacifiers / dummies will have fewer daily breastfeeds. When breast stimulation and milk removal are reduced engorgement will occur and milk production decreases. This can lead to early termination of breastfeeding. Pacifier use is strongly correlated with a short duration of breastfeeding and is often an indication of an underlying breastfeeding difficulty. 3. <b>For</b> these reasons, <b>dummies</b> are not supplied to the obstetric wards. Parents wishing to provide a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> their <b>baby</b> should be informed of the risks of introducing a dummy whilst breastfeeding is being established. 4. The midwife must document that the mother has made an informed choice if she opts to use a teat or dummy...|$|R

As we discussed in Sect.  2, individuals spending more time on housework may select themselves into less demanding jobs or jobs with more flexible working conditions and thus negative compensating wage differentials. To control for this sort of selection, we further include a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> flexible working hours and a set of <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> the (one-digit) occupation.|$|R
30|$|In all {{specifications}} {{the control}} variables are {{the age of}} household head and its square, the number of members in the households (or the number of dependant children), a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> marital status (1 if married, 0 otherwise), a time <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> 2009, and a constant. Other specifications were estimated but those reported here are the best ones in terms of econometric guarantees and economic sense. Particularly, regional dummies, the log of expenditures in clothes, cars, health, and other household spending items, <b>dummies</b> controlling <b>for</b> {{the size of the}} city, and time <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> others years were included but they were not statistically significant. Additionally, among the rejected variables as potential instruments, we have <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> housing ownership (if financed with a mortgage, if rented), the number of labour active members, a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> sex of household head, the log of durable goods for housing expenditures and the log of durable goods for leisure expenditures.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{functional}} forms to operationalize {{the interaction between}} age at arrival and the <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> non-Spanish-speaking country of origin. These are described in Table A 2 in Bleakley and Chin’s paper. Specifically, the <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> non-Spanish-speaking country can be interacted with (i) age at arrival, (ii) age at arrival—critical period threshold, (iii) age at arrival dummy variables, and (iv) a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> age at arrival before critical threshold. We have chosen (i) for reasons of simplicity. We found that alternative parameterizations yielded very similar results.|$|R
30|$|Almost {{all other}} control {{variables}} in specification 5 (and across the other specifications) have insignificant coefficient estimates. Exceptions are the <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> short programme (which is always marginally significant and positive) and the <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> published paper (which is positive {{and at least}} marginally significant in most specifications). The <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> migrant-specific programmes is insignificant. While this implies that these programmes are equally (in)effective as general ones, this result has to {{be interpreted with caution}} as the number of studies analysing migrant-specific programmes is small.|$|R

The coefficient β 0  is a vector of unknown parameters to be estimated representing the impact of certain factors on the propensity. Finally ε 0 i, represents error term.|$|R

Overall, the results changed only slightly compared with when we included those <b>dummy</b> variables. <b>For</b> example, the coefficient of skills transferability (Transfer [...]...|$|R

30|$|The {{effects of}} foreign {{ownership}} on bargaining {{power over the}} wage negotiation are unclear, however: half of the <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> owner’s domicile have positive and half have negative effects on wages, but few are statistically significant. The only exceptions are Denmark, which is positively significant, and Norway and Finland, which are both significantly negative; the <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> all other countries are insignificant. In the partial model, where all foreign-owned firms are studied jointly, the <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> foreign ownership is not statistically significant.

30|$|Using {{each of the}} {{measures}} of subjective well-being as the dependent variable, I first estimated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions by gender. In the baseline model, I control for the following respondents’ characteristics: age and its square; three <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> race/ethnicity; five education dummies; number of disabilities 7; an immigrant dummy; number of children; a metropolitan status dummy; two season dummies; a holiday dummy; six <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> {{the days of the}} week; year dummies; <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> the DWS year; and state dummies. When the responses to the Cantril ladder or self-rated health status are used as the dependent variable, I exclude a holiday dummy, and six <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> the days of the week. 8 Then, in another set of analyses, I additionally included independent variables that are likely to have been affected by the incident of job displacement: two marital-status dummies; two employment-status dummies; and four <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> family income during the last 12  months as of the last CPS interview date 9 (Charles and Stephens 2004; Doiron and Mendolia 2012; Eliason 2012; Jacobson et al. 1993; Stevens 1997). These additional analyses would sort out whether the link between job displacement and subjective well-being is only through the changes of employment status, marital status, and income or through other mechanisms beyond the changes in employment, marital status and income.|$|R
30|$|We {{include a}} number of {{covariates}} in the model. Given {{the limited number of}} observations and characteristics available in the survey, and since most of the characteristics are observed {{at the time of the}} survey rather than at the time of leaving school (i.e., at the onset of risk), we are constrained in the number of variables that we can include in the model. The model includes a gender <b>dummy,</b> a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> urban/rural location, <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> father’s educational level (up to primary, up to secondary, and higher), <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> three school-leaving age groups (less than 16, between 16 and 18, and greater than 18), 9 a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> whether or not the individual ever worked while in school and (a 3 -year average of) per capita GDP growth at the time of leaving school, in order to account for the possible impact of initial labor market conditions on the subsequent probability of finding employment. Finally, we include <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> missing values of all included variables. Note that not all variables (or not all values of these variables) are available for all the countries in the sample, so we report associated coefficients for the variables (or the categories of variables) for which data are available. As for the descriptive statistics, estimates are weighted by sampling weights.|$|R
