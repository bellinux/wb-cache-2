25|$|According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, {{strategic}} {{decision making in}} organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel {{strategic decision}} making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding <b>information,</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives {{are based on the}} knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.|$|E
25|$|With the 1950s came {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval.</b> As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, {{as well as other}} professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous special interest groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.|$|E
2500|$|Like other writing systems {{derived from}} the Arabic script, Urdu uses the 0600–06FF Unicode range. Certain glyphs in this range appear {{visually}} similar (or identical when presented using particular fonts) even though the underlying encoding is different. This presents problems for <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval.</b> For example, the University of Chicago's electronic copy of John Shakespear's [...] "A Dictionary, Hindustani, and English" [...] includes the word '' (India).

This is because the medial form of the Urdu letter do chashmi he (U+06BE)—used to form aspirate digraphs in Urdu—is visually identical in its medial form to the Arabic letter hāʾ (U+0647; phonetic value [...] ).

2500|$|Jean-François Lyotard {{identified}} in The Postmodern Condition {{a crisis in}} the [...] "discourses of the human sciences" [...] latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the [...] "computerized" [...] or [...] "telematic" [...] era (see information revolution). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, <b>information</b> <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval,</b> such knowledge becomes increasingly [...] "exteriorised" [...] from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as [...] "data"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites. Furthermore, the [...] "diversity" [...] of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.|$|E

We propose a geographic location free double-ruling-based scheme for large-scale 3 D sensor networks. The proposed approach does not require a 3 D sensor network with a regular cube shape or uniform node distribution. Without the knowledge of the geographic location and the distance bound, a data query simply travels along a simple curve with the guaranteed success to retrieve aggregated data through time and space with one or different types across the network. Simulations and comparisons show the proposed approach with low cost and a balanced traffic load. I...|$|R

30|$|LC 4 MP {{argues that}} one of the {{automatic}} cognitive selection mechanisms for <b>information</b> encoding, <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> is the orienting response, or OR (Lang 2000). OR refers to humans’ automatic physiological and behavioral reactions that occur in response to novel stimuli, or the “what-is-it?” response (Stern et al. 2001, p. 57). When an OR occurs, the viewer orients his or her sensory receptors toward the stimulus that caused the response. This orienting response results in an organized set of physiological responses as well as behavioral responses (Lynn 1966). One type of physiological response to a novel stimulus, an essential component of the orienting response, is heart rate deceleration (Bolls et al. 2001; Leshner et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{growth of}} <b>information</b> acquisition, <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> {{capacity}} {{has led to}} the development of the practice of lifelogging, the undiscriminating collection of information concerning one’s life and behaviour. There are potential problems in this practice, but equally it could be empowering for the individual, and provide a new locus for the construction of an online identity. In this paper we look at the technological possibilities and constraints for lifelogging tools, and set out some of the most important privacy, identity and empowerment-related issues. We argue that some of the privacy concerns are overblown, and that much research and Lifelogging 2 commentary on lifelogging has made the unrealistic assumption that the information gathered is for private use, whereas, in a more socially-networked online world, much of it will have public functions and will be voluntarily released into the public domain...|$|R
