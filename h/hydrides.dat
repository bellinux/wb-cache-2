5|$|Neptunium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{in a similar}} manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the <b>hydrides</b> NpH2+x (face-centered cubic) and NpH3 (hexagonal). These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium <b>hydrides,</b> although unlike PuH2+x, the lattice parameters of NpH2+x become greater as the hydrogen content (x) increases. The <b>hydrides</b> require extreme care in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at 300°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{reacts with}} calcium and magnesium <b>hydrides</b> in tetrahydrofuran forming tetrahydroaluminates.|$|E
5|$|In {{inorganic}} chemistry, <b>hydrides</b> {{can also}} serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron <b>hydrides)</b> and aluminium complexes, {{as well as in}} clustered carboranes.|$|E
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{are reduced}} by strong <b>hydride</b> donors such as lithium aluminium <b>hydride</b> and diisobutylaluminium <b>hydride</b> to give primary alcohols. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminium <b>hydride,</b> a bulky <b>hydride</b> donor, reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, {{as does the}} Rosenmund reduction using hydrogen gas over a poisoned palladium catalyst.|$|R
40|$|The stress {{fields of}} {{expanding}} (precipitation) and contracting (dissolution) <b>hydride</b> plates were computed by {{finite element method}} using Zr–H solid solution and <b>hydride</b> properties at 25, 200 and 400 °C for fully and semi-constrained <b>hydride</b> plates. For the first time simultaneous <b>hydride</b> expansion and matrix contraction and vice-versa have been considered in a simulation of <b>hydride</b> precipitation and dissolution, respectively. It was observed that a fully constrained expanding <b>hydride</b> plate exerts a tensile stress field in the matrix {{close to the edge}} of the <b>hydride</b> plate while a partially contracting <b>hydride</b> plate exerts a tensile stress field in the <b>hydride</b> plate as well as a large compressive stress in the surrounding matrix close {{to the edge of the}} <b>hydride</b> plate. It is suggested that a compressive stress component in the matrix acting normal to a partially shrinking <b>hydride</b> plate could possibly explain an enhanced resistance to <b>hydride</b> embrittlement of Zr-alloy at elevated temperature...|$|R
5000|$|Mercury(II) <b>hydride</b> {{undergoes}} {{the typical}} chemical reactions of a molecular metal <b>hydride.</b> Upon treatment {{with a standard}} acid, mercury(II) <b>hydride</b> converts to a mercury salt and elemental hydrogen. Oxidation of mercury(II) <b>hydride</b> gives mercury(II) oxide.|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal <b>hydrides,</b> where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing <b>hydrides,</b> complex metal <b>hydrides,</b> or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lithium and its complex <b>hydrides,</b> such as Li, {{are used}} as high-energy {{additives}} to rocket propellants. Lithium aluminum hydride {{can also be used}} by itself as a solid fuel.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} boranes are diborane B2H6 {{and two of}} its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. A large number of anionic boron <b>hydrides</b> are known, e.g. 2−.|$|E

50|$|Amorphous copper <b>hydride</b> is also {{produced}} by anhydrous reduction. In this process copper(I) and tetrahydroaluminate react to produce molecular copper <b>hydride</b> and triiodoaluminium adducts. The molecular copper <b>hydride</b> is precipitated into amorphous copper <b>hydride</b> {{with the addition}} of diethyl ether. Amorphous copper <b>hydride</b> is converted into the Wurtz phase by annealing, accompanied by some decomposition.|$|R
50|$|Uranium {{zirconium}} <b>hydride</b> (UZrH), {{a combination}} of uranium <b>hydride</b> and zirconium(II) <b>hydride,</b> {{is used as a}} fuel/moderator in the TRIGA-class reactors.|$|R
5|$|Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and {{nitrides}} are refractory materials, as {{are those}} of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium <b>hydrides</b> ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The <b>hydrides</b> are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E
5|$|From the {{structural}} perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the <b>hydrides.</b> Included {{in this series}} are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B12H122−), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric <b>hydrides.</b> Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
50|$|Metal hydride-oxidizer {{mixtures}} {{replace the}} metal with its corresponding <b>hydride.</b> They are generally safer to handle than the corresponding metal-oxidizer compositions. During burning they also release hydrogen, which {{can act as}} a secondary fuel. Zirconium <b>hydride,</b> titanium <b>hydride,</b> and boron <b>hydride</b> are commonly used.|$|R
25|$|Mechanisms 1 and 2 {{represent}} <b>hydride</b> gain, {{in which}} the molecule gains what amounts to be one <b>hydride</b> ion. Mechanisms 3 and 4 radical formation and <b>hydride</b> loss. Radical species contain unpaired electron atoms and are very chemically active. <b>Hydride</b> loss is the inverse process of the <b>hydride</b> gain seen before. The final two mechanisms show nucleophilic addition and a reaction using a carbon radical.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hydride</b> {{complexes}} are catalysts and catalytic intermediates in {{a variety}} of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic cycles. Important examples include hydrogenation, hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, hydrodesulfurization catalysts. Even certain enzymes, the hydrogenase, operate via <b>hydride</b> intermediates. The energy carrier Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reacts as a <b>hydride</b> donor or <b>hydride</b> equivalent.|$|R
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron <b>hydrides</b> and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group <b>hydrides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and <b>hydrides.</b> If the metal is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury(II) <b>hydride</b> can be {{produced}} by <b>hydride</b> generation. In this process, mercury(II) and tetrahydroborate or tetrahydroaluminate ions react to produce mercury(II) <b>hydride</b> according to the following equation: ...|$|R

50|$|In 1844, the French chemist Adolphe Wurtz {{synthesised}} copper <b>hydride</b> for {{the first}} time. This reaction consisted of the reduction of copper sulfate with hypophosphorous acid. In 2011, Panitat Hasin and Yiying Wu {{were the first to}} synthesise a metal <b>hydride</b> (copper <b>hydride)</b> using the technique of sonication. Copper <b>hydride</b> has the distinction of being the first metal <b>hydride</b> discovered. In 2013, it was established by Donnerer et al. that, at least up to fifty gigapascals, copper <b>hydride</b> cannot be synthesised by pressure alone. However, they were successful in synthesising several copper-hydrogen alloys under pressure.|$|R
5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal <b>hydrides.</b> The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{potential}} \mathit E_\frac{M^4+}{AnO2^2+} increases from −0.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction {{ability of the}} An4+ ion from americium to uranium. All actinides form AnH3 <b>hydrides</b> of black color with salt-like properties. Actinides also produce carbides with the general formula of AnC or AnC2 (U2C3 for uranium) as well as sulfides An2S3 and AnS2.|$|E
5|$|In <b>hydrides</b> and nitrides, {{protactinium}} {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
40|$|Aqueous normal phase {{chromatography}} possesses {{characteristics of}} both normal phase (NP) and also reverse phase (RP) chromatography. It can retain polar {{as well as}} non-polar compounds by carefully selecting the concentration ratio of organic solvent to water in the mobile phase. Silica <b>hydride</b> columns contain {{only a small percentage}} of silanol groups which are polar in nature and have an effect on the separation process. Diamond <b>hydride</b> columns consist of a small amount (~ 2 %) of carbon chemically bonded to a silica <b>hydride</b> surface. This research work characterized both hydride-based silica and diamond <b>hydride</b> stationary phases under isocratic and gradient conditions. Both columns were compared using the same conditions, and their efficiencies and symmetries were calculated. Diamond <b>hydride</b> showed different selectivity than the silica <b>hydride</b> column because of the 2 % carbon on the silica <b>hydride</b> surface. This research work shows that both the silica <b>hydride</b> and diamond <b>hydride</b> columns can be used in aqueous normal phase conditions...|$|R

5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} <b>hydrides</b> are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms <b>hydrides</b> on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and <b>hydrides</b> that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
