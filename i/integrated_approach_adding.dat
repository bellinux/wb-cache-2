40|$|A joint {{initiative}} of NLR, DLR, and TU Delft has been initiated {{to streamline the}} process of generating audible impressions of novel aircraft configurations. The <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> <b>adds</b> {{to the value of}} the individual tools and allows predicting the sound of future aircraft before they actually fly. Hence, an existing process for the aircraft design and system noise prediction at DLR has been upgraded to generate the required input data for an aircraft auralization framework developed by NLR and TU Delft. This paper presents the new process and an initial application towards the fully automated auralization of novel aircraft configurations within the conceptual aircraft design phase. Such an early auralization of the new designs enables the aircraft designer to assess the success of selected low-noise measures in an intuitive way in addition to the conventional measures, e. g. noise isocontour areas. The auralization result is able to capture all the predicted noise shielding measures used in the current application and indicates that, for an approach condition, drastically reduced ground noise exposure can be achieved.

30|$|The last {{stage in}} the CRISSIS program’s <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> brought <b>added</b> {{operational}} value to the project. Recent research on risk assessment in coastal areas – for instance in the Languedoc Roussillon region, the projects RNACC (“Risques Naturels, Assurances et Changement Climatique” [“Natural Risk, Insurance and Climate Change”], Yates-Michelin et al. 2011) and ANR MISEEVA (2008 – 2011, Vinchon et al. 2011; Meur-Férec et al., 2011) – did not {{go as far as}} integrating crisis management. And yet the preparedness of local authorities is essential. Any failings on their part can significantly amplify the impact of extreme phenomena in coastal areas, turning a crisis into a full-blown disaster (Daniels et al. 2011; Genovese et al. 2011). This is particularly true in regions where the stakes are high and diverse, and where a crisis can involve multiple public and private stakeholders. Local players should therefore be trained in crisis management, including by organizing crisis exercises (Lagadec 1993, 2001, 2012; Stern 2014).|$|R
40|$|Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is effecting a {{fundamental}} change throughout the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and educational institutes have taken different approaches in response. A few have adopted an <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> which <b>adds</b> VDC into existing curricula, others have concentrated on delivering separate content via dedicated subject or {{have focused more on}} the technology, Building Information Modelling (BIM), or taken a wider approach by also including the VDC process. Under these differing scenarios, appropriate assessment modes come into question, and need to be centred around intended learning outcomes. This paper focusses on the challenges of setting up and conducting assessments for VDC in a tertiary construction project management (CPM) education setting. A developmental action research methodology was adopted leading to a documented case study, built around an undergraduate level BCons CPM course (Planning and Organisation 2) at Unitec. VDC was used as a central delivery and assessment vehicle. The main challenges encountered were twofold, firstly, finding the balance between CPM knowledge and skills and BIM software skills, and secondly, the unfamiliarity of the VDC environment for both the students and the teaching staff...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{large body}} of {{research}} addresses the best methods and practices to treat individuals with aphasia. Much of this research focuses on individuals who have aphasia secondary to stroke. While {{the most common cause}} of aphasia is stroke, aphasia can also result from other brain diseases or injury. Relatively little research has focused on oncological aphasia resulting from brain cancer. This research examined aphasia treatment efficacy in an individual with aphasia following removal of a brain tumor. Methods: Standardized testing was used to evaluate the clinical profile of an individual with oncological aphasia. An <b>integrated</b> language treatment <b>approach</b> was implemented with one participant with fluent aphasia using a multiple baseline across behaviors design. CIUs/utterances and percentage of CIUs produced were compared across baseline, treatment and post-treatment phases with four different conversational partners. Treatment effect size was calculated with each conversational partner. Standardized assessments were also administered before and after treatment. Results: Small treatment effect sizes were found with three of the four conversational partners. The participant showed generalization of skills acquired on standardized motor speech, spoken language, memory, and functional communication measures. Discussion: Findings add to evidence in support of <b>integrated</b> treatment <b>approaches</b> and <b>add</b> to the knowledge of the baseline performance of individuals with aphasia due to brain tumor removal. Findings suggest that effects of integrated treatment extend to functional communication...|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots for {{rough terrain}} are of {{interest}} to researchers as their range of possible uses is large, including exploration activities for inhospitable areas on Earth and on other planets and bodies in the solar system, searching in disaster sites for survivors, and performing surveillance for military applications. Nature generally achieves land movement by walking using legs, but additional modes such as climbing, jumping and rolling are all produced from legs as well. Robotics tends not to use this <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> and <b>adds</b> additional mechanisms to achieve additional movements. The spherical device described within this thesis, called Jollbot, integrated a rolling motion for faster movement over smoother terrain, with a jumping movement for rougher environments. Jollbot was developed over three prototypes. The first achieved pause-and-leap style jumps by slowly storing strain energy within the metal elements of a spherical structure using an internal mechanism to deform the sphere. A jump was produced when this stored energy was rapidly released. The second prototype achieved greater jump heights using a similar structure, and added direction control to each jump by moving its centre of gravity around the polar axis of the sphere. The final prototype successfully combined rolling (at a speed of 0. 7 m/s, up 4 ° slopes, and over 44 mm obstacles) and jumping (0. 5 m cleared height), both with direction control, using a 0. 6 m spherical spring steel structure. Rolling was achieved by moving the centre of gravity outside of the sphere’s contact area with the ground. Jumping was achieved by deflecting the sphere in a similar method to {{the first and second}} prototypes, but through a larger percentage deflection. An evaluation of existing rough terrain robots is made possible through the development of a five-step scoring system that produces a single numerical performance score. The system is used to evaluate the performance of Jollbot. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> for synthesis, {{design and}} {{operation}} of separation schemes is presented. This <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> is based on driving forces that promote the desired separation for different separation techniques. A set of algorithms needed by the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> for sequencing and design of distillation columns and for generating hybrid separation schemes are presented. The main feature of these algorithms is that they provide a "visual" solution which {{also appears to be}} near optimal in terms of energy consumption. Several illustrative examples highlighting the application of the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> are also presented. Introduction Synthesis and design of process flowsheets involve generation and identification of feasible alternatives, process/solvent design, determination of optimal condition of operation together with the optimal process flowsheet and many more. In an <b>integrated</b> <b>approach,</b> the objective is to consider various aspects related to, for example, synthesis [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{researcher}} {{wanted to}} find out how the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> to corporate governance enhances company performance. In the past periods many corporations collapsed and this was attributable to failure to keep in pace with corporate governance evolution trend. On contrary the performance of Delta Beverages proved to be well and it is in that same period that it appreciated and adopted the evolution in corporate governance leading to its adoption of an <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> to corporate governance. In light of this, the researcher was then prompted to find out how this <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> enhances company performance. The study looked into many sources of literature on the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> to come up with more informed scientific outcomes on the effectiveness of risk management in GRC, how GRC enhances company performance and the benefits accruing from the adoption of GRC. Conclusions were drawn from a total sample of 33 respondents consisting of directors, managers and general employees.

40|$|Combining Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) and Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) is now of {{increasing}} interest. The customary {{approach is the}} sequential approach, where ASP is optimised before ALB. Recently, interest in the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> has begun to pick up. In an <b>integrated</b> <b>approach,</b> both ASP and ALB are optimised at the same time. Various claims have been made regarding the benefits of integrated optimisation compared with sequential optimisation, such as access to a larger search space that leads to better solution quality, reduced error rate in planning and expedited product time-to-market. These benefits are often cited but no existing work has substantiated the claimed benefits by publishing a quantitative comparison between sequential and <b>integrated</b> <b>approaches.</b> This paper therefore compares the sequential and <b>integrated</b> optimisation <b>approaches</b> for ASP and ALB using 51 test problems. This is done so that the behaviour of each approach in optimising ASP and ALB problems at different difficulty levels can be properly understood. An algorithm named Multi-Objective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimisation (MODPSO) is applied in both approaches. For ASP, the optimisation {{results indicate that the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> is suitable to be used in small and medium-sized problems, according to the number of non-dominated solution and error ratio indicators. Meanwhile, the sequential approach converges more quickly in large-sized problems. For pure ALB, the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> is preferable in all cases. When both ASP and ALB are considered, the <b>integrated</b> <b>approach</b> is superior to the sequential approach...|$|R
