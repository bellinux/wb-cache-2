40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the production planning of a manufacturing system capable of producing several types of part. The demands are known {{at the end of}} each <b>elementary</b> <b>period</b> ({{at the end of each}} day or week for instance). The objective function (i. e. the criterion) is the sum of inventory, backlogging and sep-up costs on a finite horizon. We use the concept of lot to simplify management decisions: instead of launching in production parts type by type, we launch lots. A lot is a mix of parts of different types. The drawback is the definition of the manufacturing times of the lots. We consider that the manufacturing time of a lot is its manufacturing time in steady state: it is a way to associate a manufacturing time to each lot, independently from the work-in-process and the set-up times. As a consequence, we have to launch identical lots in series to reduce the error made by introducing this hypothesis. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm and a branch-and-bound approach to solve this problem. Numerical examples are provided...|$|E

Metsämuuronen (2013) showed with an experimental study that the overall achievement level in a secondary language enhanced statistically significantly whit repeated testing design. Previously, Tuvling (1967) and Karpicke & Roediger (2008) showed with a laboratory experiment that remembering the material studied is the most efficient with repeated testing sessions rather than with repeated studying sessions. An explanation for this, given by Lasry, Levy and Tremblay (2008), is that the repeated testing leads to multiple traces to the memory, which optimizes recall.

Randomized, matched-pairs (N = 7 + 7) of students with the same teacher, the same lessons and the same routines participated in the experiment. The intervention for the experimental group consisted of a set of short, ten-minute tests during each three-hour study session held twice weekly. IRT modeling with linking items served to equate the test scores. ANOVA was used to analyze the gain score between the pre-test and post-test. The experimental group improved statistically significantly more than did the control group. The learning curve was a nonlinear, wide U or J shape after the first <b>elementary</b> <b>period</b> of learning the letters and basic vocabulary. The repeated testing sessions helped the students raise their language proficiency level more than without the repeated testing sessions.

40|$|Background: Self-esteem {{has been}} the focus of a vast body of {{literature}} over the last decades because of its association with psychopathology (e. g. Baumeister, 2003). Most of the research into self-esteem focused on explicit self-esteem. Recently, however, it has been proposed that implicit self-esteem and the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem are important concepts to further explain the relationship between self-esteem and psychopathology (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Bosson, 2000, 2003). Although research is still scarce, discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem seem to be related to psychological maladjustment. Moreover, the direction of this discrepancy seems to be associated with distinct patterns of problems (Bosson, 2003; Schroder-Abe, 2007). High levels of explicit self-esteem and low levels of implicit self-esteem (fragile self-esteem) are linked to e. g. narcissism and defensiveness (Jordan, 2003; Zeigler-Hill, 2006) whereas low levels of explicit and high levels of implicit self-esteem (damaged self-esteem) seem to be related to e. g. depressive symptoms (Creemers, 2012). To date, no studies into these associations and patterns of self-esteem in children exist. The aim of the present study is therefore to analyze the relationship between implicit self-esteem, explicit self-esteem, the discrepancy between the two and emotional, behavioral and social problems in children across the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period.</b> Method: Children (623) from elementary schools in the Netherlands were followed annually from kindergarten until fifth grade. Emotional, behavioral and social problems were obtained annually from multiple informants using a peer nomination procedure (Coie, Dodge et al., 1982) and the Problem Behavior at School Interview (Erasmus MC, 2000). The strength and difficulty questionnaire was used to measure self-reported problems. Implicit self-esteem was assessed using the self-esteem BIAT (Brief Implicit Association Test) (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Results: A significant association was found between the discrepancy of implicit and explicit self-esteem and self-reported problems measured at age 12. Additionally, initial results show significant associations between self-esteem discrepancy and teacher and peer reported emotional, behavioral and social problems over the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period.</b> Moreover, associations seem to be dependent on the direction of the discrepancy; fragile self-esteem seems to be related to different problems than damaged self-esteem. Conclusion: This study showed that the discrepancy between children’s implicit and explicit self-esteem is negatively associated with emotional, behavioral and social problems, measured through multiple informants over the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{temporal}} aggregation in production planning is addressed. A single facility with multiple part types is considered.

We consider a two-level hierarchy composing a sub- problem at each level, and we propose an iterative technique which solves these sub-problems in sequence.

30|$|By {{means of}} this {{short-term}} trading, the preallocated resources can be accurately {{adapted to the}} actual demand situation on the cell level. However, the further into the future a given trading period lies, the more uncertain the estimation becomes. Operators can only make rough, averaged estimations, including recurrent variations over a day, and generic corrections, for example, before upcoming events with presumably higher traffic demand. However, if an operator expects a high traffic period for a longer time than one <b>elementary</b> trading <b>period,</b> he may desire to acquire more transmission resources in advance for that longer period and not just before each short trading period.

However, in the way discussed up to here, operators still face some uncertainty about their allocation in future time frames. After each frame, allocation is reverted to the initial allocation and an operator cannot be sure to acquire a certain number of additional resources again for the upcoming frame which he perhaps had acquired for the current frame.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: One {{feature of}} literate language, noun phrase elaboration, was {{examined}} in the oral fictional narratives of school-aged children. Method: Two narratives were elicited from 5 -, 8 - and 11 -year-old children, 1 {{in response to a}} picture sequence and 1 in response to a single picture. Noun phrases were categorized into 4 types. Results: Simple designating noun phrases were produced by all children at age 5, simple descriptive noun phrases by all children at age 8, and noun phrases with postmodification by all children at age 11. All noun phrase types were produced by more children in object than in subject position and in the single picture than in the picture sequence context. Conclusion: There are important developmental changes in noun phrase elaboration in the elementary school years as children learn to manage narrative contexts. Even within picture tasks, variations in visual depiction can affect the use of elaborated noun phrases (ENPs), with more descriptive language more likely to occur in narratives based on a single picture fantasy context than on a realistic picture sequence context.

Poor and better readers were defined to belong to the lowest 30 % and to the higher 70 % of a longitudinal sample, respectively. It appeared that for word recognition the developmental curves for the groups were very distinct and followed similar patterns. For reading comprehension, vocabulary and spelling, the developmental curves showed similar patterns with decreasing differences across grades, however. Clear seasonal effects were found for reading comprehension, vocabulary and spelling, while the seasonal effect for word recognition was restricted to the early grades. It appeared that students with initially poor abilities in word recognition and reading comprehension showed greater improvement over time on reading comprehension, vocabulary and spelling than students with initially better abilities in word recognition and reading comprehension. These findings contradict the existence of a Matthew effect for these skills. For word recognition, a clear differential effect could not be found: the groups did not differ systematically in mean development. The gap between the poor and better decoders did not widen over time for this skill; so a Matthew effect for word recognition was not supported...|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} study (Sekine & Furyama, 2009), which investigated {{the development of}} discourse in Japanese elementary school children, found {{that the number of}} gestures produced basically increases with age during the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period,</b> however, the number of gestures decreases temporarily in the middle grades (9 - and 10 -years-olds). To understand why middle graders produce fewer gestures than other ages fully, it is necessary to look at their speech hand gestural production closely. Adult speakers sometimes stop making a gesture in the process of production and change it to an adaptor, such as touching their hair or scratching an eye, which seems a socially preferable movement, and that satisfies personal needs an helps one adapt to the environment. I termed this behavior a disguised adaptor, which is defined as a gesture that is altered to an adaptor, before or while the stroke of gesture is executed. Since this disguised adaptor might be related to the temporal decrease of gesture production in the Japanese middle graders, it is important to examine the appearance of disguised adaptors during the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period.</b> This study investigates whether elementary school children produce disguised adaptors, and if so, when and how they produce them. Sixty school aged children and their parents participated in this study. Out of sixty children, there were ten children in each grade, from first to sixth grade (7 - to 12 -year-olds), half were boys and the other half were girls. Each child watched a seven-minute animated color cartoon from the Tweety and Sylvester series in a quiet room. After watching it, the child was instructed to retell the story to their parent. However, the listener was not allowed to ask any questions or provide any prompts such as 'Then?' or 'Next?' unless the child appeared stalled or distracted. Disguised adaptors were found in elementary school children. Disguised adaptors produced were categorized into two types; an adaptor that occurred by itself without a gesture after it, and an adaptor where a gesture was produced immediately after the adaptor finished within a gesture unit. The result showed that children did not produce either type of disguised adaptor until the age of 8. As for the number of children who produced disguised adaptors without after-gesture, out of ten children for each age group, there was one 9 -year-old, three 10 -year-olds, and five 11 -year-olds, and two 12 -year-olds. Emergence of disguised adaptors implies that children start to notice that a listener pays attention to a speaker's gestures. Such awareness begins from 9 -, 10 -year-olds. Why do children produce disguised adaptors from the middle grades? There are two possible hypotheses. One is that children start having knowledge 1) that gestures can be seen as informational recourse by others, or 2) that gesturing is an undesired behavior in specific situations. Considering the fact that older children produce gestures after a disguised adaptor, children start to see gestures as an informational source with age...|$|R

40|$|Production {{management}} and control of job shops is an important and complex problem. This dissertation proposes a two-level hierarchical method for tactical production planning in such environments. We first develop a scheme to design the planning hierarchy by aggregating parts into families and resources into manufacturing cells; a priori aggregation of <b>elementary</b> time <b>periods</b> into aggregate time periods is assumed. Based {{on the results of}} the design stage, the medium- and short- term production planning problems are formulated. The objective of the production planning problems consists of minimizing the holding costs for the work-in-process and finished goods inventory and the backlogging costs for unfulfilled demand. The formulations are complemented by capacity constraints, inventory state equations, and constraints that ensure feasibility of the aggregate production plan. We decompose the global production planning problem such that the short-term planning sub-problems can be computed in parallel. An efficient solution algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problems of the hierarchy. The algorithm has been shown to converge to near-optimal solutions in a finite number of iterations. Furthermore, the algorithm provides optimal solutions for a special case of the planning problem. The hierarchical approach is evaluated with respect to computational complexity, memory requirements, {{and the quality of the}} resulting production plans. The hierarchical approach is also tested on an industrial case and the resulting plan is compared with the one obtained from the company's Manufacturing Resource Planning system...|$|R

40|$|Specific {{effects of}} word decoding, {{vocabulary}} and listening comprehension abilities {{on the development}} of reading comprehension were longitudinally examined for a representative sample of 2143 Dutch children throughout the <b>elementary</b> school <b>period.</b> An attempt was made to test two theoretical frameworks for the prediction of the development of reading comprehension: the lexical quality hypothesis in which word decoding and vocabulary are assumed to be critical determinants of reading comprehension and the simple reading view in which reading comprehension is assumed to be the product of word decoding and listening comprehension. The results showed significant progress across grades on all of the predictor and criterion measures. The stability of the measures was also high across time, which shows the individual differences between students to remain across grades. Word decoding exerted a substantial effect on early reading comprehension and a small effect on later sixth grade reading comprehension. The data provide empirical support for the lexical quality hypothesis as they show knowledge of word forms and word meanings (i. e. vocabulary) to predict the development of reading comprehension. Support for the simple reading view was also found in that word decoding and listening comprehension significantly predicted reading comprehension as well. A combined structural model with word decoding, vocabulary and listening comprehension as predictors of reading comprehension showed a substantial impact of the three predictors on reading comprehension at first grade. In subsequent grades, vocabulary is still predicting reading comprehension directly whereas listening comprehension shows a reciprocal relationship with vocabulary.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s and early 2000 s, China’s Ministry of Education {{embarked}} on an ambitious program of elementary school mergers by shutting down small village schools and opening up larger centralized schools in towns and county seats. The goal {{of the program was}} to improve the teacher and building resources in an attempt to raise the human capital of students in poor rural areas, although it was recognized that students would lose the opportunity to learn in the settings of their own familiar villages. Because of the increased distances to the new centralized schools, the merger program also entailed building boarding facilities and encouraging or mandating that students live at school during the week away from their family. Given the magnitude of the program and the obvious mix of benefits and costs that such a program entails there has been surprisingly little effort to evaluate the impact of creating a new system that transfers students from school to school during their <b>elementary</b> school <b>period</b> of education and, in some cases, making student live in boarding facilities at school. In this paper, our overall goal is to examine the impact of the Rural Primary School Merger Program on academic performance of students using a dataset from a survey that we designed to reflect transfer paths and boarding statuses of students. We use OLS and Propensity Score Matching approaches and demonstrate that there is a large “resource effect” (that is, an effect that appears {{to be associated with the}} better facilities and higher quality of teachers in the town and county schools) that appears to be associated with the transfers of students from less centralized schools (such as, village schools) to more centralized schools. Boarding, however, is shown to have negative impacts on academic performance. However, students who transfer to county school benefit from the transfer no matter where they start and whether they board or not. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{correlational}} study profiles morphosyntactic {{awareness in}} children struggling with reading comprehension in grades 5 to 7. The research is underpinned by two theoretical frameworks {{of reading and}} word identification. According to the Simple View of Reading, reading comprehension {{is the product of}} decoding and language comprehension. The Lexical Quality Hypothesis proposes that words stored in long term memory vary in the degree to which semantic, orthographic and phonological features are interlocked in long term memory. Students completed measures of intelligence, reading and morphosyntactic awareness which were both oral and written to investigate a) the students’ strategic use of morphemes in sentence-based tasks, b) whether difficulties with oral versus written tasks were more predictive of reading comprehension ability, and c) whether measures of morphosyntactic awareness could be differentiated {{on the basis of their}} usefulness in predicting comprehension ability. Results showed that while word identification was the strongest predictor of reading comprehension, oral measures of morphosyntactic awareness were useful in a model of prediction. Results are examined in light of both theoretical frameworks. Difficulties for this sample of poor comprehenders likely originate in struggles with word identification. The finding that oral measures of morphosyntactic measures predict comprehension for poor and typical comprehenders demonstrates the importance of considering sensitivity to morphologically complex words in oral language in late <b>elementary</b> school, a <b>period</b> of dramatic growth in knowledge of morphologically derived word forms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how Japanese students’ past {{language}} studies, in formal classroom settings during their elementary school years and their overseas experiences before entering university, affected their affective and strategic aspects of English learning in university level English classes within the framework of Goal Theory (Dweck 1986). The participants consisted of 556 EFL learners at two national universities, who were asked to report their age, gender and experience – or lack thereof – with English learning during <b>elementary</b> school, the <b>period</b> of overseas experiences, goal orientations, learning strategy preferences, beliefs, anxiety, and how much time they spent learning English outside the classroom per week. The results of a categorical regression analysis indicate that, as Goal Theory presumes, students’ goal orientation types determine their beliefs, anxiety, and behaviors. The results also suggest that the English learning experience in formal classrooms during elementary schools in Japan had little impact on the learners’ current English learning at the university level. Conversely, overseas experiences not only had an effect on minimizing the fear of using English, but also act to predict the average time devoted to learning English outside the classroom. In summary, this study found that the real experience of using the target language overseas was a more significant factor than the age at which the participants actually started learning English...|$|R
