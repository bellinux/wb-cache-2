40|$|This paper qualitatively {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} enhance curriculum design and delivery processes in universities through the development and introduction of new information systems and procedures. It examines the experiences of 5 out of the total 27 institutions involved in the UK JISC Curriculum Design and <b>Delivery</b> <b>programme</b> as they attempted to implement campus-wide changes. Common themes that emerged across all 5 projects were the interconnectedness of university systems, proliferation of alternative ‘feral’ systems, a tendency for project remits to drift, resistance {{from other parts of}} the institution, planning imperatives, staff turnover and dependency failures. Conclusions are that cultural change underpins effective innovation and that cultural change is harder than technical innovation. It is best achieved through participatory, campus-wide approaches, although a “submarine” strategy may be necessary to deflect opposition. Stakeholders should be kept informed about benefits to them and it is important for projects to be responsive and adaptive and to recognise that participatory approaches may be institutionally risky. It concludes with practical recommendations for achieving lasting large scale change in the higher education environment.

The significance of the RLDP lies not only in its marginal success, but also in its failures. It brought to the surface the intractable ideologies and vested interests behind the patterns of property ownership in South African cities, as well as the lack of policies or procedures to challenge them. As a result, urban development in general, and in Greater Johannesburg in particular has, since 1994, reinforced rather than confronted apartheid geography. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2003. The {{water sector}} in South Africa {{is in the}} {{delivery}} phase of its transformation process, with transformation having commenced in 1994. This transformation is not unlike developments in this sector in other developing countries. South Africa is facing huge backlogs {{in the provision of}} basic rural water and sanitation services (DWAF, 2002 a, p. 3), typical of the scenario facing international developing countries. The SA Government has committed itself to eliminate the basic water supply backlogs by 2008, and the basic sanitation backlogs by 2010 (DWAF, 2002 b, p. ii). These targets are more ambitious than the international Millennium Development Goals of halving the world's population without adequate or safe drinking water, or access to basic sanitation by 2015 (WSSCC, 2002 a, p. l). The research investigates whether the targets set by Government are achievable in the Province of Kwazulu-Natal (KZN). The South African targets were set ahead of the completion of the Water Services Development Plans or the planning required of the Water Services Authorities (WSAs) in KZN. Although some Municipalities, in their capacity as Water Services Authority, have completed their Water Services Development Plans, others are {{still in the process of}} doing so. The deficiency in the provision of basic water and sanitation services in KZN, has been ascertained in this investigation. Also ascertained are the costs and financial resources needed to address the backlogs in service provision and the constraints to delivery of the needed services. The research findings have shown that the backlog in basic water supply in KZN is approximately 3, 66 million people, representing 38, 2 % of the KZN population, whilst the backlog in basic sanitation services is 4, 94 million persons, representing some 51, 4 % of the KZN population. In a rural context only, these figures are appreciably higher. This investigation has shown that the targets set by Government to address rural backlogs in basic services in KZN are ambitious. In terms of planned programmes at Water Services Authority level, it will take an estimated average of 12 years to eliminate the basic water supply and sanitation backlog. The earliest and longest water supply delivery programme ranges from 5 years to 20 years, whilst that for sanitation delivery, ranges from 6 years to 33 years. These programmes far exceed Government's target dates. In terms of the research findings, the backlogs in basic water services in KwaZulu-Natal will require financial resources of R 4, 87 billion to totally eradicate all basic water backlogs. Similarly, to address the basic sanitation backlog has been estimated at R 1, 44 billion. It has been recommended in this report that with relatively little additional annual funding that it will be easier to achieve the government target of 2010 (DWAF, 2002 b, p. ii) for sanitation delivery than it would for water supply. The planned level of sanitation service has been ascertained to be the VIP latrine in all cases, which does not require a water supply, and thus water and sanitation <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes</b> can be implemented separately. The investigation has revealed that there is sufficient grant funding available in South Africa to meet the planned basic water services <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes</b> of the WSAs, but their programmes exceed the target dates set by Government by many years. If the <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes</b> are accelerated to meet the Government's target dates, the current budget allocations of both DWAF and the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) are insufficient. In the short-term, the WSAs are not expected to have sourced donor funding to assist with their planned <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes.</b> Thus funding sources within South Africa will initially have to be relied upon. Whilst planned programmes have been developed for the alleviation of water services backlogs in KZN, it has been recommended in the report that they need to be monitored to ensure delivery of services in terms of these programmes. This monitoring and certification of the implementation of planned programmes are essential management tools, as the current planned programmes of the WSAs do not meet the Government's targets of 2008 and 2010 respectively for the elimination of the basic water and sanitation backlogs (DWAF, 2002 b,. ii). Financial budgets have been cited as being a problem area by most, but a higher priority problem appears to be the lack of institutional capacity at WSA level to ensure sustainability of projects/schemes in the post-construction phase. Should the projects/schemes not be adequately operated or maintained, it could lead to the implemented projects/schemes becoming defunct, which would negate the national initiatives aimed at backlog alleviation. It is fortunate that legislation such as the Municipal Systems Act (Act N° 32 of 2000) enables Local Government to implement a range of public and private water service provider options that can assist with the needed institutional capacity building, and to also render operations and maintenance services on a contract basis. It is evident from this investigation that a number of major obstacles may delay the achievement of either the planned <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes</b> of the WSAs, or the even greater challenges to meet the Government's targets. The successful, sustainable implementation of these programmes will be dependent on both sufficient funding being available and on solving the lack of institutional capacity. Umngeni Water...|$|E
30|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} to tackle freight parking congestion: one is improving the parking supply through infrastructure investments; the second one is to influence freight parking demand through policies and regulations such that the existing infrastructure is better utilised and congestion is lessened. To support the first approach, cities’ authorities often provide guidelines and regulations {{for the construction of}} adequate freight parking infrastructure. For instance, at least one loading/unloading bay for every 4000  m 2 of retail area is required in Singapore [3]; in the UK the requirement is set at a minimum of one lorry space per 750  m 2 of retail space [4]. The second approach consists of implementing urban logistics initiatives, i.e. policies and regulations enacted by the public sector to foster sustainable logistics practices [5].

40|$|Increasingly public {{institutions}} are {{making use of}} project management to implement service <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes.</b> Through the delivery of various non-formal certificate courses in Project Management at various {{public institutions}}, at local, provincial and national, it became evident that public managers to a considerable degree, fail to infuse project management {{as part of the}} functional operations, processes and structure of the institution. Furthermore, there is an apparent lack of understanding on how to utilise project management on an ongoing basis for the operationalisation of institutional strategies and objectives. This article proposes a process to address these two issues. The main recommendation is that senior management should establish a Management by Projects approach whereby all functional activities for service delivery are seen as projects. Guidelines will be proposed to implement this approach in public institutions. “Just being able to conceive bold new strategies is not enough.

40|$|Abstract Post-coital intravaginal {{cleansing}} (IVC) could {{counteract the}} protective {{effect of a}} vaginal microbicide. IVC less than 1 h after sex is discouraged in most micro- bicide trials. During a microbicide trial in KwaZulu-Natal, we collected quantitative data on post-coital IVC. We discussed IVC during in-depth-interviews (IDIs) and focus- group discussions (FGDs) with women enrolled in the trial, and during FGDs with community members. Nearly one- third (336 / 1, 143) of women reported IVC {{less than an hour}} after sex. In multivariate analysis, post-coital IVC was associated with younger age, larger household size, greater sexual activity, consistent gel use, and clinic of enrolment. During IDIs and FGDs, respondents described post-coital IVC as a common hygiene practice motivated by the need to remove semen, vaginal fluids and sweat, although this practice may be amenable to change in the context of microbicide use. We need to consider strategies for influencing post-coital IVC practices in future microbicide trials and <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes.</b> Keywords Microbicides, Acceptability, Adherence, Post-coital intravaginal cleansing, South Afric...|$|E

While government policies and <b>delivery</b> <b>programmes</b> are trying to meet the need, a number of challenges, including increasing urbanisation and levels of poverty are continuously raising the demand.

Despite a tradition of self-help housing in South Africa and a number of formal programmes to promote aided self-help housing, it has not gone to scale. This could be related to a number of challenges inherent in the particular South African context, including the significant role that the state plays in housing delivery, linked to an insufficient consideration of the local market, land supply patterns, land values and housing mix...|$|E
