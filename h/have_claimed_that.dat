He insisted on involving more theorists. but many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Fermi and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically infeasible and politically undesirable.

5|$|The Law of Prairial was the {{breaking}} point for opponents of Robespierre. Resistance to the Terror spread throughout the Convention, and Saint-Just was compelled to address the division. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> he proposed a dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he delivered his uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E

Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E

5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
5|$|Knight {{doubts that}} Clarence13X {{set out to}} build a {{movement}} or a culture, but after his death, the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States. Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence13X's birthday as a holiday, and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life. Numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group; some accounts <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> he gambled only {{as a means to}} reach others with his teachings. He did not leave behind a record of his teachings, and the group had few formalized tenets {{at the time of his}} death. In the following decades, the group's doctrine became more complicated.|$|E

5|$|The Congress Street Bridge was on Connecticut Historical Commission's list of bridges. Local {{businesses}} and residents <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> are experiencing reductions in traffic {{as a result}} of the closure of the bridge and that it has increased emergency response times. In 2002, Bridgeport's official historian, Charles W. Brilvitch, stated that the City of Bridgeport promised P. T. Barnum to keep the bridge open and free, forever. The promise was made when the city purchased the previous bridge from Barnum and annexed East Bridgeport in 1864. However, limited funds became a concern, with the money needing to be directed to more important projects.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E
5|$|Some historians <b>have</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> had German {{intruder}} operations been maintained over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, {{which produced}} {{the nucleus of}} the huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue intruder operations, in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence of an effective German intruder campaign at this time may have given the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors attributable to the OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|E
