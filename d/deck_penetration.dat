50|$|The Millennium gun is easy {{to install}} as it {{requires}} no through <b>deck</b> <b>penetration</b> and needs no supply of coolant, air or ship's power to operate. However, it does need a power supply to recharge its batteries. Installation can take as little as sixty minutes and requires only six square metres of deck space. A Millennium gun and 252 rounds weighs 3,200 kg. The gun's cupola is claimed to have a low radar cross section.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} use of precast, prestressed bridge deck panels on new and existing precast, prestressed concrete girders. The evaluation focuses on the ease of construction {{and the ability of}} the system to develop composite action with the concrete girders. A system developed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT) and Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute New England Region (PCINER) was chosen for testing from available systems because it is representative of the current geometry of precast bridge deck panels. The CDOT system was evaluated in a series of large scale tests in which the panels were placed on a 40 ft prestressed concrete girder and subjected to three point loading. The CDOT system is compared to a new system developed as part of the research program. The new system addresses durability and ease of construction issues that are problematic with current joint details. The strength and geometry of both the current and new joint details are evaluated and compared in a series of direct shear tests. A final, large scale specimen was designed, constructed, and loaded to evaluate the new system. It was concluded that the behavior of the new system is comparable to that of the CDOT system. In addition, the new system is easy to construct and minimizes <b>deck</b> <b>penetrations,</b> thereby enhancing durability. This research has the potential to impact {{the way in which the}} aging highway system is rehabilitated and replaced by reducing the associated time and costs of construction while decreasing disruption to the traveling public. ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1912 - An {{interior}} inspection at arch 7 {{occurred in}} late October. A large stone was removed to allow access and three platforms with ladders were erected inside to facilitate {{inspection of the}} walls and underside of the deck. There were no broken or cracked stones and all joints were still full of good hard mortar. A photo from the inspection shows the formation of stalactites under the <b>deck</b> indicating water <b>penetration</b> which may have caused the deck arch problems from freeze/thaw cycles resulting in frost disintegration.|$|R
50|$|Arnold Snyder is a {{professional}} gambler and gambling author. He was elected by professional blackjack players {{as one of the}} seven original inductees into the Blackjack Hall of Fame which is hosted at Barona Casino for his record as a blackjack player and his innovations in professional gambling techniques. He was the first blackjack authority to publish the importance of <b>deck</b> <b>penetration</b> (depth of the deal) in card counting, in his 1980 book The Blackjack Formula. He was also the first blackjack researcher to publish (in Blackjack Forum, 1981-1983) that radical simplification of blackjack card counting systems did not hurt earnings.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 8 weighed 121856 lb {{including}} the breech and {{was capable of}} an average rate of fire of 2.4 - 3 rounds a minute. It could throw a 1,140 lb. (517.093 kg) Mark 18 armor-piercing shell 38,573 yards (35,271 meters) at an elevation of 45°. The previous 12" [...] gun manufactured for the U.S. Navy was the Mark 7 version, used in the World War I era s, could only throw an 870 lbs kg shell 24000 yard m, at an elevation of 15° [...] The Mark 8's significant improvement in firing weight and range over the Mark 7 gave it the honor of [...] "by far the most powerful weapon of its caliber ever placed in service." [...] In fact, {{as a result of}} the decision to fire [...] "super heavy" [...] armor-piercing projectiles, the Mark 8's <b>deck</b> plate <b>penetration</b> was better and the side belt armor penetration equal to the older (but larger) 14"/50 caliber gun.|$|R

40|$|Intrusion of deicing {{materials}} and surface water into concrete bridge decks is a main contributor in deck reinforcing steel corrosion and concrete delamination. Salt, spread on bridge decks to melt ice, dissolves {{in water and}} permeates voids in the concrete deck. When the chloride content of the concrete in contact with reinforcing steel reaches a high enough concentration, the steel oxidizes. In Iowa, the method used to reduce bridge <b>deck</b> chloride <b>penetration</b> is {{the application of a}} low slump dense concrete overlay after the completion of all Class A and Class B floor repairs. A possible alternative to the use of dense concrete overlays, developed by Poly-Carb, Inc., is the MARK- 163 FLEXOGRID Overlay System. FLEXOGRID is a two component system of epoxy and urethane which is applied on a bridge deck to a minimum thickness of ¼ inch. An aggregate mixture of silica quartz and aluminum oxide is broadcast onto the epoxy at a prescribed rate to provide deck protection and superior friction properties. The material is mixed on site and applied to the deck in a series of lifts (usually two) until the desired overlay thickness has been attained...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed impact-echo (IE) method, which utilizes an impact and subsequent displacement {{monitoring of the}} concrete surface, appears promising for the inspection of concrete structures. IE {{has been shown to}} be particularly suitable for void, delamination, and cracking detection in hardened concrete structures including bridge <b>decks</b> since deep <b>penetration</b> into the structure and one-sided accessibility are obtained. For this method to be reliable, however, accurate measurements of peak frequencies in the magnitude spectrum of the frequency domain must be made. In addition, the interpretation of confusing spectrums may be required. The first part of this paper reviews the existing impact echo technique, including typical signal generation and capture possibilities as well as the accepted signal processing. Next, an alternative approach to signal processing is developed; this approach is based on a brief literature review and laboratory experiments. It is proposed that this approach, based on the spacing of peaks in the magnitude spectrum may reduce the uncertainty of impact echo signal analysis...|$|R
