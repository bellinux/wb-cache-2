5000|$|An offset SPUI {{is similar}} to a diamond {{interchange}}, however, by making two of the ramps flyovers or <b>flyunders,</b> all ramps are pushed {{to one side of the}} highway, where they meet the surface street at a single intersection.

50|$|Interstate 90 Business is a 1 mi {{business}} loop of Interstate 90 in Mullan. It {{runs from}} a westbound only <b>flyunder</b> interchange at exit 68 along River Road then Friday Avenue, and turns south onto Atlas Road to end at a diamond interchange for exit 69.|$|E
50|$|Later {{the turnpike}} passes the Tazewell High School and some gas {{stations}} {{mixed in with}} primarily a residential area, which becomes more commercial east of Perry Street. The road curves northeast as it intersects Ben Bolt Road, and later crosses a bridge over the South Fork of the Clinch River thus entering an eastern sliver of North Tazewell where it encounters a diagonal intersection with State Route 61. Only after this intersection does the road run parallel to the North Fork of the Clinch River and a former Norfolk and Western Railroad line. Briefly curving to the right, it uses a low bridge over that river which now runs along {{the south and east}} side of the road (sometimes even at the shoulder of the road), while the railroad line remains along the north and west side of it. The road ends at an eastbound on-westbound off <b>flyunder</b> interchange with US 19/460.|$|E
