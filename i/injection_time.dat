40|$|Electron {{injection}} from a photoexcited chromophore into semiconductor (TiO(2)) nanoparticles {{is one of}} the key {{electron transfer}} processes in dye-sensitized solar cells. We describe our model for calculations of electron <b>injection</b> <b>times,</b> which is based on partitioning the semiconductor chromophore system into fragments (TiO(2) slab with adsorbed chromophore's anchoring group, and an isolated chromophore), and calculating the imaginary part of the self-energy from the electronic properties of the fragments: density of states of TiO(2) slab, TiO(2) -anchoring group coupling, and chromophore's wave function coefficients. The electronic properties of the semiconductor and its interface with the chromophore's anchoring group are reused for all chromophores with the same anchoring group (carboxylic acid in this study), and only a calculation of the isolated chromophore's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is required for each chromophore. We use this model to calculate electron <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> for a large set of organic chromophores, including, e. g., perylene dyes and biisonicotinic acid, on TiO(2) rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces. The calculated <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> are in good agreement with reported experimental <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> or light conversion efficiencies of solar cells based on these dyes. Our model is computationally efficient and allows us to make reliable predictions of electron <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> for families of chromophores sharing the same adsorption chemistry...|$|R

Diluted ethylene was injected through a 2 -mm nozzle at a Reynolds number of 5, 000 into an open duct, with a slow oxidizer co-flow. Microgravity tests are conducted in NASA's 2. 2 Second Drop Tower. Flames with short <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> and high duty cycle exhibit a marked increase in the ensemble-averaged flame length due to the removal of buoyancy. The cycle-averaged centerline temperature profile reveals higher temperatures in the microgravity flames, especially at the flame tip where the difference is about 200 K. In addition, the cycle-averaged measurements of flame radiation were about 30 % to 60 % greater in microgravity than in normal gravity...|$|R

Approximate effective electronic coupling strengths for the heterogeneous electron-transfer interaction have been extracted from the calculated electronic structures and are used to estimate femtosecond electron-transfer times theoretically. Results are presented for perylenes attached to the TiO 2 via formic acid (Pe-COOH), propionic acid (Pe-CH 2 -CH 2 -COOH), and acrylic acid (Pe-CHdCH-COOH). The calculated electron transfer times are between 5 and 10 fs with the formic acid and the conjugated acrylic acid bridges and about 35 fs with the saturated propionic acid bridge. The calculated electron <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> are of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding experimental values and qualitatively follow the experimental trend {{with respect to the}} influence of the different substitutions on the <b>injection</b> <b>times.</b> 1...|$|R

Significant structural adjustments of both the dye and the nanocrystal are predicted to be induced by the strain imposed by the simultaneous formation of multiple dye−surface bonds. Electronic properties of the combined dye−nanocrystal system have also been calculated, including information about interfacial orbital mixing and the lowest excited singlet states. Ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer processes across the dye−nanoparticle interface in dye-sensitized solar cells are finally discussed in view of estimated electronic coupling strengths. The calculations predict <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> {{on the order of}} 10 fs for MLCT excitations to the ligand π* levels that interact most strongly with the TiO 2 conduction band, and an order of magnitude increase in the <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> for excitations to dye levels with poor spatial or energetic overlaps with the substrate conduction band...|$|R

50|$|This {{equation}} may be complemented {{with two}} conservation equations: A +C = A0 and B +C = B0 , A0 and B0 being the total concentrations of the compounds A and B {{at the beginning}} of the reaction. These two concentrations A0 and B0 vary during each injection of compound B (which typically lasts more than 0.5 s and less than 3 to 4 s), but are constant between two successive injections (separated by much longer times). We consider here a simplified situation where the short <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> is neglected, which means that A0 and B0 are constant during each titration step. In addition, the problem of the finite response time of the instrument is also neglected. It is explained in the following how these limitations can be suppressed.

50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|E

40|$|The {{co-injection}} {{moulding process}} was studied. The experimental work from several tools, such a square plaque plate moulding {{has led to}} an understanding of the mechanism of dual injection mould filling. Emphasis has been focussed the relationships between the rheological property of the polymers and the relevant moulding parameters. The skin-core formations, which cot-relate to these relationships, were also studied. Many factors were introduced for understanding the effect on the skin-core adhesion where the two polymers are incompatible. In this case a compatibiliser was found to be one of the most important factors. In the presence of compatibiliser, the chemical reaction between active functional groups of skill and compatibiliser in the core occurred. Suitable conditions were necessary to produce good bonding between skin and core. The greater thickness of skin layer and greater. simultaneous <b>injection</b> <b>times</b> led to more probability for the skin and core active functional groups to react with each other before the skin became no-flow layer.

Since the oil is injected by capillary phenomenon, the volume flow rate can be calculated by utilizing Kirchhoff&# 39;s pressure law. Then, we calculated the oil <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> of the FDBs with a tied shaft by dividing the volume flow rate by the clearance volumes of the journal bearing, the thrust bearing, and the recirculation channel (RC), respectively.

The total oil injection times of the FDBs with and without a RC were 0. 302 and 0. 335 s, respectively.

40|$|In this work, the {{decomposition}} {{behaviors of}} methane hydrate in the porous media are investigated in the three-dimensional cubic hydrate simulator (CHS) using the huff and puff method {{with a single}} well with the different injection temperatures and different <b>injection</b> <b>time.</b> The changes of the system pressure are analyzed by using the biggest increasing degree of the system pressure during injection stage (PII) and the biggest increasing degree of the system pressure during soaking stage (PIS), and the result shows that the <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> has more obvious effect on the system pressure than the injection temperature. The cumulative volume of the produced gas increases with the increases of the injection temperature and <b>injection</b> <b>time.</b> The higher injection temperature results in the smaller volume of the produced water; whereas the higher <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> results in the bigger volume of the produced water. In addition, increasing the injection temperature and <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> may not enhance the thermal efficiency and energy efficiency. The optimum period for the gas production is the first 4 - 5 cycles. The highest energy efficiency can be obtained at the injection temperature of 130 degrees C and the <b>injection</b> <b>time</b> of 5 min. Furthermore, the experiment verifies that a moving decomposition boundary occurs in the hydrate decomposition process, {{and there is a}} maximum decomposition boundary with the thermal huff and puff cycle.
