5|$|El Greco {{was born}} in Crete, which {{was at that time}} part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that {{tradition}} before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.|$|E

5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded.

The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about {{the conduct of the}} games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag {{to the president of the}} CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.|$|E

25|$|Born into an upper-class {{household}} {{with strong}} political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed {{in the world}} of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.|$|E
25|$|When Neo-Classicism {{started to}} go into decline by the 1830s, genre and {{portrait}} painting became the focus for the Realist and Romantic artistic revolutions. Many of the <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> of that period included still life in their body of work. The still-life paintings of Francisco Goya, Gustave Courbet, and Eugène Delacroix convey a strong emotional current, and are less concerned with exactitude and more interested in mood. Though patterned on the earlier still-life subjects of Chardin, Édouard Manet’s still-life paintings are strongly tonal and clearly headed toward Impressionism. Henri Fantin-Latour, using a more traditional technique, was famous for his exquisite flower paintings and made his living almost exclusively painting still life for collectors.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} {{areas where the}} <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> congregated, one of them being near Le Dôme at no. 10 rue Delambre called the Dingo Bar. It was the hang-out of artists and {{expatriate}} Americans and the place where Canadian writer Morley Callaghan came with his friend Ernest Hemingway, both still unpublished writers, and met the already-established F. Scott Fitzgerald. When Man Ray's friend and Dadaist, Marcel Duchamp, left for New York, Man Ray set up his first studio at l'Hôtel des Ecoles at no. 15 rue Delambre. This is where {{his career as a}} photographer began, and where James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau and the others filed in and posed in black and white.|$|E

25|$|Like all <b>great</b> <b>artists,</b> Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, lay in {{the fact}} that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

500|$|Boult {{was born}} in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a {{successful}} businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric {{and his family had}} [...] "a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs" [...] with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, [...] "Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by <b>great</b> <b>artists</b> as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford." [...] While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.|$|E
500|$|The BBC's Jon Lusk did {{not share}} the high {{opinions}} of other critics. He was [...] "not mad about" [...] vocalists Aziz Sahmaoui and Sabine Kabongo but found Alegre Corrêa [...] "agreeable enough". He liked [...] "In a Silent Way", calling it [...] "beautifully serene" [...] but wished there were other performances with similar [...] "reflective moments". The review in The Times by John Bungey was more positive. He noted {{that it was not}} a [...] "generally sad affair, hard-to-take document" [...] as are most final recordings of <b>great</b> <b>artists,</b> but instead [...] "a compelling last testament of a mighty group and a fine human being". Nick Coleman's review in The Independent was mixed; he wrote that the [...] "tempos border on the frantic, phrases are spat, the will to trade licks is never less than testosteronal" [...] but quipped that for [...] "every sublime passage there's a butch one". John Fordham of The Guardian contrasted the release to Zawinul's 2005 live album Vienna Nights. One difference he emphasized was [...] "the typhoon drumming of Paco Sery and a battalion of percussionists [...] gives Zawinul the option of letting long stretches of the music simply groove". He also noted that there was no comparable track with the duet with Shorter on Vienna Nights.|$|E
