40|$|Glued-laminated timber (glulam) is a {{wood product}} formed by <b>face</b> <b>bonding</b> lumber {{laminations}} in a prearranged {{order to create}} larger structural members. Capable of spanning greater lengths and carrying greater loads, glulam has advanced wood as a building material. Although glulam timber offers significant improvement over sawn timber, its ultimate bending strength often remains limited by strength reducing flaws, such as knots and finger joints, in the tension zone. Tensile reinforcement of glulam has been researched in the past, most commonly using metal reinforcement, without commercial success. Recent advances in high strength composites, such as pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), offer new opportunity to further engineer glulam. This project developed a pultruded, phenolic, E-glass FRP to be compatible {{with two of the}} most widely used glulam species, Douglas-fir (DF) and western hemlock (WH), using conventional wood laminating methods an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{possible}} {{physical and}} chemical forces controlling the volume change behavior of kaolinite were ascertained from the sediment volume of kaolinite in various solvents under no external oad condition and from conventional oedometer measurements of kaolinite in several pore fluids. The min-imum sediment volume of 14. 5 cmV 10 g clay occupied by kaolinite in water where repulsive (R) forces were dominant indicated that the R contribution was insignificant for kaolinite. The maximum sediment volume of 25. 0 cmV 10 g clay in benzene where coulombic attraction forces were significant suggested that electrostatic attraction between silicate sheets and midplane cations and van der Waals forces were not appreciable for kaolinite. The positive edge-negative <b>face</b> <b>bonding</b> of kaolinite particles in benzene was unlikely because the protons required to impart a positive charge to the edges were not available in the nonpolar solvent. The 3688 cm-l band in the infrared spectrum ofa kaolinite-dimethylamine sample decreased by 10 cm- 1 on H-bond formation of the solvent molecule with the exposed structural hydroxyls of the octahedral sheet. The adsorbed solvent molecules likely H-bonded with an adjacent clay particle. That such interparticle H-bonds controlled the sediment volume and interparticle attraction in kaolinite was indicated by the decrease in sediment volume with increase in dipole moment of the solvent molecule, i. e., 25. 0 cmV 10 g clay in n-heptane (dipole moment,/ ~ = 0), 23. 5 cmV 10 g clay in toluene ~ = 0. 36) ...|$|E

The minimum sediment volume of 14. 5 cm^ 3 / 10 g clay occupied by kaolinite in water where repulsive (R) forces were dominant indicated that the R contribution was insignificant for kaolinite. The maximum sediment volume of 25. 0 cm^ 3 / 10 g clay in C_ 6 H_ 6, where coulombic attraction forces were significant, suggested that electrostatic attraction between silicate sheets and midplane cations and van der Waals forces were not appreciable for kaolinite. The positive edge-negative <b>face</b> <b>bonding</b> of kaolinite particles in C_ 6 H_ 6 was unlikely. The 3688 cm^- 1 band in the IR spectrum of a kaolinite-dimethylamine sample decreased by 10 cm^- 1 on H-bond formation of the solvent molecule with the exposed structural hydroxyls of the octahedral sheet. The adsorbed solvent molecules likely H-bonded with an adjacent clay particle {{as indicated by the}} decrease in sediment volume with increase in dipole moment of the solvent molecule. In the oedometer tests with various pore fluids, a high void ratio of approximate 1. 3 was obtained for kaolinite in n-heptane, and hexane (μ≃ 0) at an external pressure of 1 kg/cm^ 2 probably because the weakly bonded kaolinite particles were randomly oriented. At the corresponding applied pressure, a lower void ratio of 0. 88 resulted in water (μ = 1. 84) where the stronger H-bond between flat layer surfaces of adjacent particles favored a parallel orientation of clay particles. The volume change behavior was essentially controlled by frictional forces and clay fabric. In nonpolar solvents the random arrangement of kaolinite particles and the frictional forces mobilized a high shear resistance on the application of a consolidation pressure, resulting in a lower compressibility. In a solvent with high dipole moment the parallel array of clay particles mobilized less shear resistance and produced a greater compression...|$|E
40|$|Globally {{there is}} a {{shortage}} in supply of rural health professionals. Tele-health was developed to help reduce distance barriers for health professionals in geographically isolated locations seeking continued medical education (CME). E-health includes all health information and health care delivered electronically. Further, telehealth defines all telecommunication technology used to transfer health information and health care. Tele-health comes in a variety of forms including videoconferencing. The use of videoconferencing to deliver medical education for rural health professionals is expanding area for health education. Videoconferencing provides a flexible method for rural GP registrars to access CME without travel. However, there is limited knowledge surrounding the use and success of telehealth for medical education. Each new telehealth project requires evaluation in order to ensure effectiveness of future programs. This study was based on one General Practice Education Year One (GPEP- 1) registrar training program trialling videoconferencing as a method of teaching rurally distant registrars. A qualitative health research thematic analysis was undertaken. All individuals involved in the study were included in this research including; three offsite registrars (who teleconferenced as they lived remotely from the seminars), three onsite registrars (who attended the face to face seminars), and three facilitators. Three focus group interviews were conducted to collect data, one for each respective group. The focus groups accounted for the participant’s individual and collective experience of teleconferencing. Seven main themes emerged from the focus groups including; group culture, facilitation, teleconferenced education, technology, personal priorities, travel, and rural/remote. These themes were further sorted into two groups; reasons for switching to teleconferencing and factors that determine {{the success or failure of}} a telehealth CME. The factors that influenced the offsite registrars reasons to switch to teleconferencing included; personal priorities, travel, and rural/ remote. Further, the other four themes determined the success or failure of the teleconferenced training including; group culture, facilitation, teleconferenced education, and technology. All seven themes were relevant for the offsite registrars and onsite registrars, however, for the facilitators only the factors that determined the success of teleconferencing were applicable. Overall, the pilot study there was no difference in the educational experience provided. This study outlined the key factors that are required for effective teleconferenced training including; face to <b>face</b> <b>bonding</b> prior to teleconferencing, a skilled facilitator that provides active facilitation, a well organised structure, good quality technology, and regular checkups with the learners teleconferencing to ensure satisfaction.

Compliant bonding is a unique method of forming this type of solid state bond between a gold lead and a gold surface since heat and pressure is transmitted through a compliant or deformable media. The use of the compliant medium ensures the physical integrity of the lead by controlling the extent of wire deformation. The process also allows one to bond a multiple number of gold wires of various dimensions simultaneously since the compliant media ensures contacting and deforming all the lead wires.|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard <b>faced</b> tool thermocompression <b>bonding</b> all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard <b>faced</b> <b>bonding</b> tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard <b>faced</b> <b>bonding</b> tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|R

The Ca-Ca interatomic distance closely relates to the hydraulic activity of beta-C 2 S. The beta-C 2 S substituted by an Sr atom for Ca(1) atoms having seven Ca-O bonds is energetically more stable than that substituted by an Sr atom for Ca(2) atoms having eight Ca-O bonds.
