30|$|Although the {{evidence}} supporting an etiologic relationship between migraine and ischemic stroke risk is substantial (Cole & Kittner 2010; Sacco et al. 2012; Sacco et al. 2008; Sacco et al. 2006), the precise mechanism(s) driving this relationship remains uncertain. Stroke, which typically affects older individuals, can be targeted for prevention by optimizing well-established standard vascular risk {{factors such as}} hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, among others. However, there exist young stroke populations (e.g. < 50 years of age) who have a paucity of <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors.

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have been}} successful in identifying common variants related to complex disorders. However, some disorders have proved resistant to this strategy with few associations confirmed, despite evidence from twin and family studies of a genetic component. Sophisticated strategies that account for phenotypic heterogeneity may be required to uncover these genetic contributions. Age at onset {{is an example of a}} potential source of this heterogeneity in ischaemic stroke. We explore the contribution of age at onset in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2 ischaemic stroke study. We first examine four <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> loci in younger onset cases. We extend this to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genome-wide, testing for stronger association signals in younger subsets of cases. Finally, we estimate the pseudoheritability accounted for by common SNPs present on genome-wide genotyping arrays for cases stratified by age at onset. We find evidence for stronger associations in younger onset cases for the four <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> loci. Genome-wide, in cardioembolic and small vessel stroke subphenotypes, a significant number of SNPs show stronger association P-values when the oldest cases are removed. Finally, we show that the pseudoheritability estimated by common SNPs in cardioembolic stroke increased from 16. 5 % for older onset cases to 28. 5 % for younger onset cases. Our results indicate that age at onset is a valuable measure for case ascertainment and in analysis of GWAS in ischaemic stroke: focussing on younger cases who may have a stronger genetic predisposition increases power to detect associations. © 2013 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Reduction in {{the risk}} of stroke and {{increase}} in the speed of hospital presentation after the onset of stroke both depend on the level of knowledge of stroke in the general population. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess baseline knowledge regarding stroke risk factors, symptoms, treatment, and information resources. Methods: A community-based telephone interview survey was conducted in the Newcastle urban area in Australia. A total of 1278 potential participants between the ages of 18 to 80 were selected at random from an electronic telephone directory. A trained telephone interviewer conducted a telephone survey using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) program. Results: A total of 822 participants completed the telephone interview. Six hundred three participants (73. 4 %) correctly identified the brain as the affected organ in stroke. The most common risk factors for stroke identified by respondents were smoking (identified by 324 [39. 4 %]) and stress (identified by 277 [33. 7 %]). The most common warning sign of stroke described by respondents was "blurred and double vision or loss of vision in an eye," listed by 198 (24. 1 %). A total of 626 (76. 2 %) respondents correctly listed >= 1 <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factor, but only 409 (49. 8 %) respondents correctly listed >= 1 warning sign. Conclusions: The level of knowledge in the community of <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors, warning signs, and treatment as indicated by this survey suggests that a community-based education program to increase public knowledge of stroke may contribute to reducing the risk of stroke and to increasing the speed of hospital presentation after the onset of stroke...|$|E

40|$|The elderly, in whom atrial {{fibrillation}} is most prevalent, carry the greatest risk, undergoing more recurrent, deadlier strokes, with bigger deficits, slower recoveries, and more comorbidities.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{quality of}} {{hospital}} care for stroke varies, particularly in rural areas. In 2007, funding to improve stroke care became available {{as part of}} the Rural Stroke Project (RSP) in New South Wales (Australia). The RSP included the employment of clinical coordinators to <b>establish</b> <b>stroke</b> units or pathways and protocols, and more clinical staff. We aimed to describe the effectiveness of RSP in improving stroke care and patient outcomes. Methods: A historical control cohort design was used. Clinical practice and outcomes at 8 hospitals were compared using 2 medical record reviews of 100 consecutive ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage patients ≥ 12 months before RSP and 3 to 6 months after RSP was implemented. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses of patient outcomes are presented. Results: Sample: pre-RSP n= 750; mean age 74 (SD, 13) years; women 50 % and post-RSP n= 730; mean age 74 (SD, 13) years; women 46 %. Many improvements in stroke care were found after RSP: access to stroke units (pre 0 %; post 58 %, P< 0. 001); use of aspirin within 24 hours of ischemic stroke (pre 59 %; post 71 %, P< 0. 001); use of care plans (pre 15 %; post 63 %, P< 0. 001); and allied health assessments within 48 hours (pre 65 %; post 82 % P< 0. 001). After implementation of the RSP, patients directly admitted to an RSP hospital were 89 % more likely to be discharged home (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 89; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 – 2. 66).

40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} worldwide. The elderly, in whom atrial fibrillation (AF) is most prevalent, carry the greatest risk, undergoing more recurrent, deadlier strokes, with bigger deficits, slower recoveries, and more comorbidities. Evidence-based data on advanced age stroke management are scarce. Age-related cerebral changes might undermine the benefit of <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> treatments. Nevertheless, the elderly should probably also undergo thrombolysis for ischemic stroke: they do not bleed more, and die not because of hemorrhage but of concomitant illnesses. Beyond natural bleeding risks, AF in advanced age has a high embolic potential if not anticoagulated. Standard or lower intensity warfarin anticoagulation prevents embolic stroke in the elderly with a hemorrhage risk even lower than aspirin. In fact, adverse effects seem to occur more often with aspirin. Excess anticoagulation hazards are prevented with lower starting doses, stricter corrections, more frequent International Normalized Ratio monitoring, and longer adjustment intervals. Validated prognostic scores such as CHADS 2 help minimize bleeds. Direct inhibitors have recently shown a benefit similar to warfarin with fewer hemorrhages. Carefully tailoring antithrombotics to this age group is therefore useful. Antihypertensives probably help 80 plu...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{utility of}} {{parenteral}} anticoagulation therapy in acute ischemic stroke has engendered much controversy and discussion. Recent studies of low-molecular-weight heparins in multiple acute stroke subtypes have not demonstrated improved outcome or reduced recurrence risk. Beneficial treatment effects may occur in subgroups such as patients with large artery atherothrombotic stroke, but further studies {{will be needed}} to prove this possibility. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: The benefits of unfractionated intravenous heparin for reducing early stroke recurrence and improving outcome remain to be established, with the current lack of appropriately powered trials in stroke subgroups at high risk for such early recurrence. To most clinicians, the primary reason to use early intravenous anticoagulation is to prevent early stroke recurrence, not to improve outcome of an <b>established</b> <b>stroke.</b> Unfortunately, effects of reduction of recurrent stroke risk may be counterbalanced by a substantial increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with intravenous anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated intravenous heparin should therefore not be used routinely in acute ischemic stroke, but it may be considered in select stroke groups at high risk for early recurrent ischemic events (ie, patients with atrial fibrillation or acute myocardial infarction and large mural thrombi). However, even in these select populations, new clinical trials {{will be needed to}} define the risk-benefit ratio...|$|E
40|$|Cerebrovascular {{accident}} (CVA) is an acutely spreading insult {{of brain}} structures of vascular origin, {{which is caused}} by multifactorial causes.

40|$|Background : Stroke, a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality is on the increase in Nigeria, routine Computerized Tomography (CT) for all Nigerians with stroke is not available to most doctors, and this poses management problems. We compared two available clinical scores with brain CT for the differential diagnosis of cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage among adult Nigerians with first-ever acute stroke. Methods : The study was conducted at the State Specialist Hospital Maiduguri. Ninety-five adult Nigerians presenting with first-ever acute stroke onset within 48 hours were evaluated with the Siriraj Hospital Stroke (SHS) score on presentation and the Guy&#x 2032;s Hospital Stroke (GHS) score 24 hours after admission. CT brain scan was considered as gold standard. These two stroke scores were compared with the results of CT brain and sensitivity, specificity; positive predictive and negative values were calculated. Results : Applying the recommended optimum cut-off points for the 2 scores, diagnoses were classified by the Guy&#x 2032;s Hospital Stroke and Siriraj Hospital Stroke score as probable hemorrhagic strokes (49 &#x 0025; and 25 &#x 0025; respectively) and probable ischemic (40 &#x 0025; and 65 &#x 0025; respectively). The remainder were classified as "uncertain.

The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the impact of TIA within 24 h preceding acute ischemic stroke (AIS) on the safety and efficacy of iv-thrombolysis. MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated the clinical and demographic data of 400 patients with AIS who were consecutively treated with iv-thrombolysis from September 2006 to May 2011 in three stroke centers. ResultsAt three-month follow-up, 58. 0 % of patients were independent (modified Rankin scale; mRS 0 – 2), 17. 8 % had died, 17. 0 % suffered hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and 4. 3 % experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). There were 29 patients (7. 3 %) who had a previous ipsilateral TIA within 24 h before <b>established</b> <b>stroke.</b> In the TIA subgroup, there was no significant higher percentage of favorable outcome (p= 0. 07) and higher SICH rate (p= 0. 15).

40|$|Background: Decreasing {{the time}} from onset to {{hospital}} arrival and improving of stroke risk factors depend on public knowledge about stroke warning signs and its risk factors. A variety of programs were conducted in different countries for public knowledge assessment of stroke and its promotion. Methods: A total of 562 persons (66. 4 female) aged over 25 years old were selected by random cluster sampling and their knowledge on stroke was evaluated using the revised 11 item questionnaire of NIH/NHLBI (National Institutes of Health/ National Heart Lung Blood Institute of USA). The complete score of the questionnaire was 54. Results: The mean stroke knowledge score {{of male and female}} participants were 23. 45 ± 9. 0 and 24. 14 ± 7. 8, respectively (P> 5 %).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) using field strengths up to 3 Tesla (T) {{has proven to}} be a powerful tool for stroke diagnosis. Recently, ultrahigh-field (UHF) MRI at 7 T has shown relevant diagnostic benefits in imaging of neurological diseases, but its value for stroke imaging has not been investigated yet. We present the first evaluation of a clinically feasible stroke imaging protocol at 7 T. For comparison an <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> imaging protocol was applied at 3 T. METHODS: In a prospective imaging study seven patients with subacute and chronic stroke were included. Imaging at 3 T was immediately followed by 7 T imaging. Both protocols included T 1 -weighted 3 D Magnetization-Prepared Rapid-Acquired Gradient-Echo (3 D-MPRAGE), T 2 -weighted 2 D Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (2 D-FLAIR), T 2 -weighted 2 D Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (2 D-T 2 -TSE), T 2 * weighted 2 D Fast Low Angle Shot Gradient Echo (2 D-HemoFLASH) and 3 D Time-of-Flight angiography (3 D-TOF). RESULTS: The diagnostic information relevant for clinical stroke imaging obtained at 3 T was equally available at 7 T. Higher spatial resolution at 7 T revealed more anatomical details precisely depicting ischemic lesions and periinfarct alterations. A clear benefit in anatomical resolution was also demonstrated for vessel imaging at 7 T. RF power deposition constraints induced scan time prolongation and reduced brain coverage for 2 D-FLAIR, 2 D-T 2 -TSE and 3 D-TOF at 7 T versus 3 T. CONCLUSIONS: The potential of 7 T MRI for human stroke imaging is shown. Our pilot study encourages a further evaluation of the diagnostic benefit of stroke imaging at 7 T in a larger study...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{consider}} {{associations between}} the latest/nadir CD 4 cell count, and {{time spent with}} CD 4 cell count less than 200  cells/μl (duration of immune depression), and myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or cardiovascular disease (CVD) (CHD or stroke) in 33   301 HIV-positive individuals. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: Analyses were undertaken using Poisson regression. To investigate whether analyses of stroke were robust {{to the type of}} endpoint, we additionally included stroke-like events and rejected strokes into the stroke endpoint. RESULTS: Participants experienced 716 MI, 1056 CHD, 303 stroke, and 1284 CVD events. Whereas {{there was no evidence of}} a higher MI/CHD risk in those with lower latest/nadir CD 4 cell counts after adjustment [current CD 4  < 100  cells/μl: relative rate (95 % confidence interval) 0. 96 (0. 62 - 1. 50) for MI, 0. 89 (0. 30 - 2. 36) for CHD; nadir CD 4  < 100  cells/μl: 1. 36 (0. 57 - 3. 23) for MI, 0. 98 (0. 45 - 2. 16) for CHD], stroke and CVD rates were higher in those with a latest CD 4 cell count less than 100  cells/μl [2. 26 (1. 29 - 3. 94) and 1. 14 (0. 84 - 1. 56), respectively]. All events occurred less frequently in those who had not experienced immune depression, although evidence for a linear association with duration of immune depression was weak. The association between stroke risk and the latest CD 4 cell count strengthened as stroke-like and rejected strokes were included; conversely, associations with <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors weakened.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the risk of ischemic stroke from a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the multiethnic {{prospective}} cohort of northern Manhattan. BackgroundPatent foramen ovale {{has been associated with}} increased risk of ischemic stroke, mainly in case-control studies. The actual PFO-related stroke risk in the general population is unclear. MethodsThe presence of PFO was assessed at baseline by using transthoracic 2 -dimensional echocardiography with contrast injection in 1, 100 stroke-free subjects older than 39 years of age (mean age 68. 7 ± 10. 0 years) from the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS). The presence of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) also was recorded. Subjects were followed annually for outcomes. We assessed PFO/ASA-related stroke risk after adjusting for <b>established</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors. ResultsWe detected PFO in 164 subjects (14. 9 %); ASA was present in 27 subjects (2. 5 %) and associated with PFO in 19 subjects. During a mean follow-up of 79. 7 ± 28. 0 months, an ischemic stroke occurred in 68 subjects (6. 2 %). After adjustment for demographics and risk factors, PFO was not found to be significantly associated with stroke (hazard ratio 1. 64, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 87 to 3. 09). The same trend was observed in all age, gender, and race-ethnic subgroups. The coexistence of PFO and ASA did not increase the stroke risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1. 25, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 9. 24). Isolated ASA was associated with elevated stroke incidence (2 of 8, or 25 %; adjusted hazard ratio 3. 66, 95 % CI 0. 88 to 15. 30).

We aimed to identify independent risk factors from lifestyle and medical history for the presence of UIAs and to investigate the combined effect of well-established risk factors. Methods-We studied 206 patients with an UIA who never had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and 574 controls who were randomly retrieved from general practitioner files. All participants filled in a questionnaire on potential risk factors for UIAs. With logistic regression analysis, we identified independent risk factors for UIA and assessed their combined effect. Results-Independent risk factors were current smoking (odds ratio[OR], 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval[CI], 2. 0 - 4. 5), hypertension (OR, 2. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 9 - 4. 6), family history of stroke other than subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR, 1. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 2. 5), hypercholesterolemia (OR, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 3 - 0. 9), and regular physical exercise (OR, 0. 6; 95 % CI, 0. 3 - 0. 9). The joint risk of smoking and hypertension was higher (OR, 8. 3; 95 % CI, 4. 5 - 15. 2) than the sum of the risks independently. Conclusions-Current smoking, hypertension, and family history of stroke increase the risk of UIA, with smoking and hypertension having an additive effect, whereas hypercholesterolemia and regular physical exercise decrease this risk. A healthy lifestyle probably reduces the risk of UIA and thereby possibly also that of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Whether smoking and hypertension increase the risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage only through an increased risk of aneurysm formation or also through an increased risk of rupture remains to be <b>established.</b> (<b>Stroke.</b> 2013; 44 : 984 - 987.) ...|$|E
40|$|Poster Session 4. Epidemiology {{and public}} health - Topic: StrokeThis journal suppl. contain EuroPRevent Congress Abstracts May 2010 BACKGROUND: Both {{increased}} oxidative and inflammatory stresses are implicated in atherogenesis. However, {{little is known about}} their role in atherosclerotic progression in patients already at the advanced cardiovascular continuum. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of oxidative and inflammatory stress on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with <b>established</b> ischemic <b>stroke.</b> METHODS: A total of 43 consecutive patients (mean age 65. 7 +/- 8. 8 years; male 70 %) with primary or recurrent ischemic stroke (> 6 months) were recruited from our medical outpatient clinics. High resolution ultrasound (Agilent Sonos 5500, Philips, USA) was used to assess burden of carotid atherosclerosis in terms of maximum intima-media thickness (mIMT). Serum malodialdehyde (MDA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were respectively measured as markers of systemic oxidative and inflammatory stress. RESULTS: These patients showed a mean mIMT of 2. 25 +/- 0. 98 mm. Serum MDA (Pearson r= 0. 32, P= 0. 035) and hsCRP (Pearson r= 0. 41, P= 0. 007) were both positively associated with mIMT. Adjusting for potential confounders by multivariate model (age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, use of aspirin/ statins/ antihypertensives and body-mass index), each 1 c，M increase in serum MDA independently predicted increase in mIMT by 0. 79 mm(95 %CI [0. 23 1. 36], P= 0. 008). Furthermore, each 1 mg/L increase of hsCRP was independently predictive of increase in mIMT by 0. 06 mm (95 %CI [0. 01 0. 12], P= 0. 017). Hyperlipidemia and diabetes accounted for IMT increase by 0. 56 mm (95 %CI [0. 04 - 1. 08], P= 0. 037) and 0. 53 mm (95 %CI [0. 01 - 1. 05], P= 0. 046) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that systemic oxidative stress strongly accelerates secondary progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with <b>established</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> independent of and above all conventional risk factors including systemic inflammation. This suggests that effective reduction of oxidative stress should be a major therapeutic target in patients at the advanced cardiovascular continuum...|$|R
40|$|Background Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is {{the third}} cause of death {{worldwide}} and the second cause of disability in adults. Ageing increases the risks for stroke, and several ageing-related changes have been demonstrated to increase the vulnerability to stroke among elderly people, and yet clinical and functional consequences may be compounded by other conditions associated with ageing. Therefore elderly {{people are more likely}} to experience stroke. However, stroke is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. By identifying and modifying risk factors among elderly, there are greater opportunities of reducing the prevalence of this condition in this special group of people. Study Objective This study was carried out with the aim of determining the prevalence of and factors for stroke among elderly patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital from June to November 2012. Methods A hospital based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted where by 266 study participants were consecutively enrolled from the admitted elderly patients in general medical wards of the MNH. Structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data entry and management and statistical analysis were performed using SPSS version 18. 0. Results A total of 84 (31. 6 %) of the 266 admitted patients had stroke. Males were slightly more than females 48 (57. 1 %) than females 36 (42. 9 %). Patients admitted with moderate stroke 36 (42. 9 %), as compared to moderate-to-severe stroke 33 (39. 3 %), severe stroke 8 (9. 5 %) and minor stroke 5 (6. 0 %). Majority had ischemic stroke 62 (73. 8 %). vii Factors significantly associated with stroke were cigarette smoking, history of hypertension, previous stroke, anaemia and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. Conclusions Stroke in elderly is common and preventable. Factors associated with stroke were modifiable traditional risk factors apart from ageing (non-modifiable). Recommendations There is a need to reduce risk factors for stroke among elderly and to <b>establish</b> <b>stroke</b> registry and treatment protocol at Muhimbili National Hospital. The primary preventive strategy should be directed to the ageing population as most of the stroke related factors are modifiable apart from age among the elderly people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{traditional}} Korean medical diagnoses employ pattern identification (PI), {{a diagnostic}} system that entails the comprehensive analysis of symptoms and signs. The PI {{needs to be}} standardized due to its ambiguity. Therefore, this study was performed to establish standard indicators of the PI for stroke through the traditional Korean medical literature, expert consensus and a clinical field test. Methods We sorted out stroke patterns with an expert committee organized by the Korean Institute of Oriental Medicine. The expert committee composed a document for a standardized pattern of identification for stroke based on the traditional Korean medical literature, and we evaluated the clinical significance of the document through a field test. Results We <b>established</b> five <b>stroke</b> patterns from the traditional Korean medical literature and extracted 117 indicators required for diagnosis. The indicators were evaluated by a field test and verified by the expert committee. Conclusions This study sought to develop indicators of PI based on the traditional Korean medical literature. This process contributed to the standardization of traditional Korean medical diagnoses. </p...|$|R
