40|$|Background In {{nutritional}} epidemiology, it {{is common}} to fit models in which several dietary variables are included. However, with standard instruments for dietary assessment, not only are the intakes of many nutrients often highly correlated, but the errors in the estimation of the intake of different nutrients are also correlated. The effect of this error correlation on the results of observational studies has been little investigated. This paper describes the effect on multivariate regression coefficients of different levels of correlation, both between the variables themselves and between the errors of estimation of these variables. Methods Using a simple model for the multivariate error structure, we examine the effect on the estimates of bivariate linear regression coefficients of (1) differential precision of measurement of the two independent variables, (2) differing levels of correlation between the true values of the two variables, and (3) differing levels of correlation between the errors of measurement of the two variables. As an example, the prediction of plasma vitamin C levels by dietary intake variables is considered, using data from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk study in which dietary intake was estimated using both a food frequency questionaire (FFQ) and a 7 -day diary (7 DD). The dietary variables considered are vitamin C, fat, and energy, with different approaches taken to <b>energy</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Results When the error correlation is zero, the estimates of the bivariate regression coefficients reflect the precision of measurement of the two variables and mutual confounding. The sum of the observed regression coefficients is biased towards the null as in univariate regression. When the error correlation is non-zero but below about 0. 7, the effect is minor. However, as the error correlation increases beyond 0. 8 the effect becomes large and highly dependent on the relative precision with which the two variables are measured. At the extreme, the bivariate estimates can become indefinitely large. In the example, the error correlation between fat and energy using the FFQ appears to be over 0. 9, the corresponding value for the 7 DD being approximately 0. 85. The error correlation between vitamin C and fat, and vitamin C and energy, appears to be below 0. 5 and smaller for the 7 DD than for the FFQ. The impact of these error correlations on bivariate regression coefficients is large. The effect of <b>energy</b> <b>adjustment</b> differs widely between vitamin C and fat. Conclusion High levels of error correlation can have a large effect on bivariate regression estimates, varying widely depending on which two variables are considered. In particular, the effect of <b>energy</b> <b>adjustment</b> will vary widely. For vitamin C, the effect of <b>energy</b> <b>adjustment</b> appears negligible, whereas for fat the effect is large indicating that error correlation close to one can partially remove regression dilution due to measurement error. If, for fat intake, <b>energy</b> <b>adjustment</b> is performed by using energy density, the partial removal of regression dilution is achieved at the expense of substantial reduction in the true variance...|$|E

Fast ignition, one method of laser-driven fusion, employs an energetic short pulse laser beam that irradiates an imploded target. Cone-in-shell targets, in which a gold cone is embedded in a shell of deuterium-tritium fuel, are one design proposed for fast ignition. Laser beams arrayed uniformly around the target implode the fuel to high densities. Energy from the short pulse laser is then funneled through the cone to ignite the dense fuel. Fast ignition is most effective when high fuel densities are achieved. The implosions of cone-in-shell targets that have been shot on OMEGA were simulated using the hydrodynamics code SAGE including laser ray tracing. It was found that portions of the shell near the cone were imploded with slower velocities, negatively impacting the uniformity of the implosion and {{the density of the}} fuel. By altering beam pointings and energies, improved implosions were found with somewhat higher peak fuel densities.

Of 1, 640 men and women recruited to participate from a nationally representative sample in 1997, 1, 301 completed four telephone 24 -hour recalls, one in each season. Participants were randomized to receive either a DHQ and Block FFQ or a DHQ and Willett FFQ. With a standard measurement error model, correlations for energy between estimated truth and the DHQ, Block FFQ, and Willett FFQ, respectively, were 0. 48, 0. 45, and 0. 18 for women and 0. 49, 0. 45, and 0. 21 for men.

The objective was to review the extent, nature and determinants of misreporting in dietary assessment, how this affects reported intakes of micronutrients and how this is identified and measured, and to identify the best {{ways of dealing with}} misreporting when interpreting results. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of misreporting of dietary intake in adults by 24 hour recalls or by estimated or weighed food records, published up to March 2008. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified. Possible causes of misreporting were identified. Methods most used to identify misreporting were the Goldberg cut-off (46 % studies) and the doubly labelled water technique (24 % studies). The magnitude of misreporting of energy intake was similar in all three dietary assessment methods. The percentage of under-reporters was about 30 % and energy intake was underestimated by approximately 15 %. Seven papers presented usable data for micronutrient intake. Absolute intakes of Fe, Ca and vitamin C (the three micronutrients addressed in all papers) were on average 30 % lower in low-energy reporters (LER) than that in non-LER and, although results were not consistent, there was a tendency for micronutrient density to be higher in LER.

Associations were adjusted for age, height, smoking, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and energy intake.  RESULTS—FEV was positively associated with intake of vitamin E in Finland, with intake of fruit in Italy, and with intake of β-carotene in the Netherlands. In all three countries men with intakes of both fruit and vegetables above the median had a higher FEV than those with a low intake of both foods.

40|$|Bit-error rate (BER) {{performance}} of a generalized multi-user differential chaos-shift-keying (DCSK) digital communication system is analyzed and optimized in this paper using baseband models. The generalized version of DSCK involves use of multiple nonrepeating chaotic spreading segments and <b>energy</b> <b>adjustments</b> and allows considerable system optimization. Theoretical BER analysis of correlation decoders based on a mathematical two-stage exact conditional approach is given {{as the foundation of}} subsequent performance studies. The consequent fully theoretical BER result gives an odd-symmetric spreading map condition for the BER to be unaffected by the mix of transmitted bits. The basis of the theoretical result is used to improve on the traditional simple Gaussian approximation (SGA) approach to the calculation of BER; this is inaccurate because it does not recognise the chaotic dynamics of DCSK. To overcome this drawback, a dynamically improved Gaussian approximation (DIGA) is developed. The DIGA approach is compared with the SGA approach, with simulation results demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency, certainly for more than five to ten users. Not only does the DIGA approach provide a more accurate BER than the SGA approach, its simple form also makes optimization of the DCSK system practically possible. The BER lower bound for the multi-user DCSK system is deduced from the DIGA approach. It is shown how the parameters and structure of the multi-user DCSK communication system can be optimized to achieve this lower bound. The work gives an exact theoretical basis of DCSK and covers several aspects which have not been treated in earlier research or have been inexactly treated...|$|R
3000|$|As well known, {{the heavy}} {{emissions}} of Greenhouse gases, such as C O 2, C H 4, N 2 O, S F 6 cause global warming, and also {{result in a}} great deal of harm to the environment. It has been a hot topic and widespread concern to study on how to strictly control the greenhouse gases emissions. In order to profoundly reduce the environment pollution, we must focus on <b>energy</b> structure <b>adjustment.</b> Without any course of mechanical motion, Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) power generation technology, also called plasma power generation technology, transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy directly into electricity. Thus by applying (MHD) power generation technology, we can realize the desulphuriz and reduce the production of N O [...]...|$|R
