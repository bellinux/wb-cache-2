25|$|The {{idea for}} a stadium at Delta Park in Portland, Oregon, was started by a {{development}} group {{in the summer of}} 1963. They looked at building a domed stadium, similar to the Harris County Domed Stadium in Houston, Texas which was being constructed at the time. Plans were made for a 46,000 seat facility that could be expanded to 80,000 or possibly 100,000. Architects drew up plans for a 17,000 vehicle parking lot. The ceiling of the dome was going to be made from plexi-glass, which would add natural light. The plexi-glass was also {{supposed to be able to}} open for ventilation and an open-air <b>feel.</b> <b>If</b> it was approved, the dome was said to be ready to open by 1968. It was estimated to cost US$25 million (US$ million adjusted for inflation).|$|E

His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by Orestes Brownson, and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics; the Ripleys' relationship became strained by the 1850s.|$|E

50|$|Empathy is also tied in {{with moral}} affect {{and is an}} {{emotional}} unfolding {{that allows you to}} be able to understand how another person <b>feels.</b> <b>If</b> we see someone is crying, then we also <b>feel</b> sad. <b>If</b> someone has just accomplished a lifelong goal, we bask in his happiness. Empathy falls under the affective component of morality and is the main reasoning behind selflessness. According to theorist Martin Hoffman, empathy {{plays a key role in}} the progression of morality. Empathy causes people to be more prominent in prosocial behavior as discussed earlier. Without empathy, there would be no humanity.|$|R

500|$|Lasseter's {{intention}} with {{a sequel}} was {{to respect the}} original film and create that world again. The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy. Brannon suggested {{the idea of a}} yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact. The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. [...] The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.

500|$|George Ripley, who {{had begun}} the experiment, made an {{unofficial}} break with Brook Farm in May 1846. Many others began to leave as well, though {{the dissolution of the}} farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem [...] "dreamy and unreal". On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts. By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445. Ripley told a friend, [...] "I can now understand how a man would <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> he could attend his own funeral". He took a job with the New York Tribune and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.|$|E

You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} {{portion of the}} segment, Oliver urges viewers to refer to Donald Trump by the Trump family's ancestral name of [...] "Drumpf".

Oliver, an alumnus of Stewart's Daily Show, justified the [...] "Drumpf" [...] epithet by insisting that [...] " [...] {{should be proud of}} his heritage!", parodying Trump's mockery of Stewart in a May 2013 Twitter post that Trump later denied having written. Oliver opines that this name is much more reflective of Trump's true nature, and says that if viewers wanted to vote for [...] "the charismatic guy promising to make America great again", they should [...] "stop and take a moment to imagine how [...] would <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> [...] just met a guy named Donald Drumpf".|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal."

500|$|For {{their second}} single, the Nice created an {{arrangement}} of Leonard Bernstein's [...] "America" [...] which Emerson described as the first ever instrumental protest song. The track used the main theme of the Bernstein piece (from West Side Story) but also included fragments of Dvořák's New World Symphony. The single concludes with Arnold's three-year-old son speaking the lines [...] "America is pregnant with promise and anticipation, but is murdered by {{the hand of the}} inevitable." [...] The new arrangement was released under the title [...] "America (Second Amendment)" [...] as a pointed reference to the US Bill of Rights provision for the right to bear arms. In July 1968, Immediate Records publicised the single with a controversial poster picturing the group members with small boys on their knees, with superimposed images of the faces of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. on the children's heads. A spokesman for the band said [...] "Several record stores have refused to stock our current single .... the Nice <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> the posters are issued in United States they will do considerable harm". During the tour that followed the release of their second album in July, the group spawned controversy when Emerson burned an American flag onstage during a performance of [...] "America" [...] at a charity event, Come Back Africa in London's Royal Albert Hall. The group were subsequently banned from ever playing the venue again.|$|E
500|$|Paul Brannigan of Q {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars. He said that the album is [...] "largely characterised by joyous new wave-influenced rock'n'roll, {{and for the first time}} in their 19-year career, Pearl Jam {{actually}} sound—whisper it—fun. No, honestly." [...] Josh Modell of Spin gave the album {{four out of five}} stars. He said, [...] "For the first time in years, Pearl Jam are seizing the moment rather than wallowing in it." [...] Time reviewer Josh Tyrangiel said, [...] "The songs here are built on hooks, covered with guitar fuzz, and then trimmed back a bit so the melody abides." [...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old <b>feel,</b> <b>if</b> not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|E
