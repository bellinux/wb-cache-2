40|$|Abstract: Product {{matching}} aims at identifying different product offers {{referring to}} the same real-world product. Product offers are provided by different merchants and describe products using textual attributes such as offer title and <b>description.</b> <b>String</b> similarity measures therefore {{play an important role}} for matching corresponding product offers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive string similarity measure that automatically adjusts the relevance of terms for the product matching. This adaptation is done step-by-step during the match process and does not require training data. We demonstrate that this approach improves the match quality in comparison to the generic TFIDF string similarity measure. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{write down}} a general action {{principle}} for spinning strings in 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime without introducing Grassmann variables. The action is written solely {{in terms of}} coordinates taking values in the 2 + 1 Poincaré group, {{and it has the}} usual string symmetries, i. e. it is invariant under a) diffeomorphisms of the world sheet and b) Poincaré transformations. The system can be generalized to an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions, and also to spinning membranes and p-branes. 2 It is well known that the classical spin of relativistic particles can be described by using either classical or pseudoclasssical variables. [1] Here we show that the same holds for spinning strings. Since the psuedoclassical <b>description</b> of spinning <b>strings</b> is well known, we obviously are implying that there exist <b>descriptions</b> of spinning <b>strings</b> solely in terms of classical variables.

With randomness alone, we show a lower bound of n − log �A =n � − O(log n) on the <b>description</b> length of <b>strings</b> in A of length n, and a lower bound of 2 · log �A =n � − O(1) on the length of any program that distinguishes a given string of length n in A from any other string.
