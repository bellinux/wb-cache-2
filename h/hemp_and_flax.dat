5|$|Runrigs, of a furrow and ridge, usually ran {{downhill}} so {{that they}} included both wet and dry land, helping to offset {{some of the problems}} of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill. Key crops included kale (for both humans and animals), and <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> for cloth production. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised primarily for meat. The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death, probably the bubonic plague, which reached Scotland in 1349 and killed perhaps over a third of the population, was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era, to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century. Towards the end of the period average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

The Commonwealth ranked ninth in population by 1860, and was a major producer of such agricultural commodities as tobacco, corn, wheat, <b>hemp,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax.</b> Geographically, Kentucky was important to the South because the Ohio River would provide a defensible boundary along {{the entire length of}} the state.|$|E

25|$|Sir John Call {{argued the}} {{advantages}} of Norfolk Island {{in that it was}} uninhabited and that New Zealand flax grew there. In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from Russia.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} Medieval period, most farming {{was based on}} the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, known as husbandmen. Runrigs usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land.

500|$|Agriculture {{has been}} an {{important}} part of Kilham's life for centuries. [...] As early as the 13th century sheep farming had been developed on the moorland, and in 1269 it was recorded that Kirkham Priory had 1,000 sheep on the [...] "great moor" [...] of Kilham. Shepherds often lived in shiellings, temporary summer settlements high in the hills. <b>Hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> were grown, and Aberdeen Angus cattle reared. The high hills and moors of Northumberland are ideal for grazing cattle and sheep, and some of England's tastiest beef and lamb is produced.|$|E
500|$|Flixton's {{population}} remained fairly stable {{until the}} end of the 17th century, when, along with other nearby parishes, it began to rise steadily. [...] It was by that time a small hamlet, with several buildings around the parish church and its parsonage. [...] The 1664 hearth tax returns show that Flixton had 70heads of household, who were likely engaged mainly in agricultural activities. [...] Evidence exists to suggest that some areas in the parish were used for textile production, with [...] "yarn croft" [...] in Flixton, Stretford and Warburton indicating the production of flax. [...] Almost 20per cent of wills and other documents gathered from nearby areas contain references to textiles, <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax.</b>|$|E

50|$|The export {{economy was}} based {{essentially}} on agriculture and livestock, while iron, copper, and gold along with such products as timber, resin, pitch, <b>hemp,</b> <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> fish were also exported.

500|$|The partly unglaciated Middle Colonies enjoyed {{fertile soil}} vastly {{different}} from the nearby New England Colonies, which contained more rocky soil. [...] Because of the large grain exports resulting from this soil, the colonies {{came to be known}} as the Bread Basket Colonies. Pennsylvania became a leading exporter of wheat, corn, rye, <b>hemp,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax,</b> making it the leading food producer in the colonies, and later states, between the years of 1725 and 1840. [...] Broad navigable rivers of relaxed current like the Susquehanna River, the Delaware River, and the Hudson River attracted diverse business. Fur trappers moved along these rivers, and there was enough flow to enable milling with water wheel power.|$|E
500|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 19th century Kilham {{consisted}} of a large farm with farmhouse and two rows of cottages for the farm's workforce. [...] There was, in addition, a smithy and a post office. [...] To the south, Thompson's Walls was by 1800 an estate with a farm complex laid out around a square courtyard. [...] <b>Hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> were grown, and a small mill is shown on maps from the 1860s onwards. The adoption of new agricultural techniques and improvements to the area's transport infrastructure resulted in greater prosperity for Kilham's farming community in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Enclosure of common land was intended to increase efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production, and Howtel Common was enclosed in 1779. Female bondagers, or outworkers, were employed to work in the fields up to the end of the 19th century. [...] The system was recorded in the Scottish Borders as early as 1656, and subsequently spread into Glendale. [...] Agricultural labourers, known as hinds, were required to provide a female, often a relative or a girl living with the hind's family, who would be on call as a day labourer whenever required. [...] The bondager's work was regarded as paying the rent of the hind's cottage.|$|E

After dredging of The Haven and related improvement, in the early 19th century the town grew rapidly as the port was revived. Grimsby's port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax.</b> New docks were needed to cope with the expansion.

25|$|The major {{agricultural}} products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials. Specific foods include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meats and spices. Fibers include cotton, wool, <b>hemp,</b> silk <b>and</b> <b>flax.</b> Raw materials include lumber and bamboo. Other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as resins, dyes, drugs, perfumes, biofuels and ornamental {{products such as}} cut flowers and nursery plants.

2500|$|Analysis of craftsmen's {{names in}} medieval records {{suggests}} that the major industries of medieval Birmingham were textiles, leather working and iron working, with archaeological evidence also suggesting the presence of pottery, tile manufacture and probably the working of bone and horn. By the 13th century there were tanning pits in use in Edgbaston Street; and <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> <b>flax</b> were being used for making rope, canvas and linen. Kilns producing the distinctive local Deritend Ware pottery, examples {{of which can be}} seen in The Birmingham History Galleries, existed in the 12th and 13th centuries, and [...] skinners, tanners and saddlers are recorded in the 14th century. The presence of slag and hearth bloom in pits excavated behind Park Street also suggests the early presence of working in iron. The borough rentals of 1296 provide evidence of at least four forges in the town, four smiths are mentioned on a poll tax return of 1379 and seven more are documented in the following century. Although fifteen to twenty weavers, dyers and fullers have been identified in Birmingham up to 1347, this is not a significantly greater number of cloth-workers than that found in surrounding villages and {{at least some of the}} cloth sold on the Birmingham market had rural origins. This was the first local industry to benefit from mechanisation, however, and nearly a dozen fulling mills existed in the Birmingham area by the end of the 14th century, many converted from corn mills, but including one at Holford near Perry Barr that was purpose-built in 1358.|$|E

DGLA (20:3 &omega;-6) provides a third, less prominent cascade. It derives from dietary GLA (18:3 &omega;-6) found in, e.g. borage oil.
