500|$|Joshua Rich from Entertainment Weekly {{had mixed}} {{views on the}} {{prospect}} of Michael returning in season four, because although Perrineau {{was one of his}} [...] "favorite" [...] actors, he liked how peaceful the series had become without Michael constantly screaming [...] "Walt!". IGN's Chris Carabott called Michael's return [...] "the worst kept secret in Lost history", but still found his reveal [...] "exciting". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau" [...] in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] Cynthia Littleton of Variety was [...] "really happy" [...] to see Michael again, and wrote [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{trying to do the right}} thing, most of the time." [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Before the fourth season finale aired, Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season, but did add [...] "This story line didn't match the hype". Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael's death [...] "the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc".|$|E
500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] had a {{share of}} good reviews, with critics acclaiming the {{character}} development and emotional struggles of Michael. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found this [...] "middle chapter" [...] to be [...] "quite good" [...] with [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle {{to deal with the}} guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to [...] "Gay Tom" [...] as [...] "a unique and funny twist". Cynthia Littleton of Variety wrote that [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{trying to do the right}} thing, most of the time." [...] In a four-out-of-five-star review, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones lauded the lack of interruption to the flashback and commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Dan Compora of SyFy Portal enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization of the rest of the main cast. In an overall positive review for the episode, The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that [...] "It seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1978 Vysotsky {{took part}} in the {{underground}} censorship-defying literary project Metropolis, inspired and organized by Vasily Aksenov. In January 1979 Vysotsky again visited America with highly successful series of concerts. That was the point (according to biographer Vladimir Novikov) when a glimpse of new, clean life of a respectable international actor and performer all but made Vysotsky seriously reconsider his priorities. What followed though, was a return to the self-destructive theater and concert tours schedule, personal doctor Anatoly Fedotov now not only his companion, but part of Taganka's crew. [...] "Who was this Anatoly? <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who in every possible situation would try to provide drugs. And he did provide. In such moments Volodya trusted him totally," [...] Oksana Afanasyeva, Vysotsky's Moscow girlfriend (who was near him {{for most of the last}} year of his life and, on occasion, herself served as a drug courier) remembered. In July 1979, after a series of Central Asia concerts, Vysotsky collapsed, experienced clinical death and was resuscitated by Fedotov (who injected caffeine into the heart directly), colleague and close friend Vsevolod Abdulov helping with heart massage. In January 1980 Vysotsky asked Lyubimov for a year's leave. [...] "Up to you, but on condition that Hamlet is yours," [...] was the answer. The songwriting showed signs of slowing down, as Vysotsky began switching from songs to more conventional poetry.|$|E
