500|$|Rodham and Bill Clinton {{bought a}} house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him. Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist {{ceremony}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham. The motivation was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, [...] "it showed that I was still me." [...] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers. Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{vacation}} at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating {{surface of the}} Grand River from his [...] "dreaming place". He postulated that [...] "it {{would be possible to}} transmit sounds of any sort" [...] by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. [...] This method of sound energy to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the on-or-off transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. [...] Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote [...] "If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, I would be able to transmit speech by telegraph" [...] (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony, inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on 10 March 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario.|$|E
