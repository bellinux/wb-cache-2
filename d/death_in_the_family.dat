5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a {{photograph}} taken just before {{the death of a}} two-year-old boy yields evidence of some supernatural intervention which piques Mulder and Scully's curiosity. When another <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> occurs, the grandmother of the remaining child requests the aid of some Romanian ritualists, named the Calusari, in order to cleanse the home of evil.|$|E
25|$|Those who do disrupt {{and discuss}} it {{describe}} the experience as, unsurprisingly, extremely painful, {{almost like a}} <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> and shameful but ultimately worth it for both the parent and the child. This resolution, however, usually cannot be reached without undergoing extensive counseling and therapy.|$|E
25|$|Although {{birth was}} {{considered}} to be ritually polluting, a <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> was thought to be much more so. In the case of the death of the oldest member of the family, whether male or female, the body would be cremated on a pyre; for all other family members burial was the norm. In either case, the ceremonies were conducted by the Maran subgroup of the community and they utilised both elements of superstition and of Hinduism. The occasions involving cremation were more ritualised than those involving burial.|$|E

25|$|By 1553, the Board of Ordnance in London had {{purchased}} more than 250 of Levett's guns. At a stroke, this English parson {{who had the}} armaments business thrust on him by <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> had morphed into a full-blown entrepreneur. Iron casting and cannon-making became England's first modern industrial economy. Old landowning families like the Sidneys, the Carylls, the Coverts and the Gratwickes rushed {{to cash in on}} the boom, which lasted for more than two centuries. The wars of Henry VIII were good for business: the 20 blast furnaces and 28 forges in Sussex in 1549 more than doubled in 25 years to 50 furnaces and 60 forges. The secret was in the English method of vertical casting.|$|E
500|$|Drummer John Stanier has {{described}} the band as [...] "the absolute simplest, most professional ensemble I have ever been involved with, by far". The band planned to meet and rehearse for a week before recording the album, but upon getting together again, Patton experienced a <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> which resulted in him leaving for several days. The band eventually reconvened to rehearse for what Stanier recalls as [...] "a day and a half".

500|$|In late August, Schroder {{participated in}} a New York City Police Department ride-a-long to prepare for his role. Season 6 {{production}} began the week of September 5. [...] David Milch, who had had multiple angioplasties influenced the storyline {{so that it would}} represent [...] "the alienation and disempowerment that almost everyone feels in a hospital, without demonizing the hospital". Milch employed his brother, who is a doctor, as a consultant. He explained to his hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, that the five-story arc was chosen because a surprise event would not have worked in this media age with the audience's expectation of the character's departure. According to Kim Delaney, during the filming of this episode the cast was repeatedly breaking down emotionally as if they were experiencing a personal <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

500|$|Diderot's Encyclopédie cites {{butterflies}} as {{a symbol}} for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting {{the mouth of a}} dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth. In line with this, the ancient Greek word for [...] "butterfly" [...] is ψυχή (psȳchē), which primarily means [...] "soul" [...] or [...] "mind". According to Mircea Eliade, some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly. In some cultures, butterflies symbolise rebirth. The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult. In the English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of bad luck. In the Philippines, a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean a <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> Several American states have chosen an official state butterfly.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 18th and 19th centuries {{the belief in}} vampires was {{widespread}} in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts {{in the belief that}} the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> although the term [...] "vampire" [...] was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption" [...] as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations {{on the part of a}} dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.|$|E

500|$|This {{story was}} the basis for the most often-cited origin tale, Moore's {{one-shot}} The Killing Joke. The Joker quits his job as a Lab assistant, becoming a stand-up comedian to support his pregnant wife. Unsuccessful, he agrees to help mobsters with a robbery and dons the Red Hood. The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane and he becomes the Joker. This version has been cited in many stories, including [...] (in which Batman deduces that the Red Hood survived his fall and became the Joker), Batman #450 (in which the Joker dons the Red Hood to aid his recovery after the events in A <b>Death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family,</b> but finds the experience too traumatic) and [...] "Death of the Family". Other stories have expanded on this origin; [...] "" [...] explains that the Joker's wife was murdered by a corrupt policeman working for the mobsters, and [...] "Payback" [...] gives the Joker's first name as [...] "Jack".|$|E
500|$|The Loogaroo is {{an example}} of how a vampire belief can result from a {{combination}} of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup-garou (meaning 'werewolf') and is common in the culture of Mauritius. However, the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States. During the late 18th and 19th centuries, there was a widespread belief in vampires in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut.

500|$|Ornstein {{was born}} in Kremenchug, a large town in the Ukrainian {{province}} of Poltava, then under Imperial Russian rule. He {{grew up in a}} musical environment—his father Avrom Gornshtein was a Jewish cantor, while a violinist uncle encouraged the young boy's studies. Ornstein was recognized early on as a prodigy on the piano; in 1902, when the celebrated Polish pianist Josef Hofmann visited Kremenchug, he heard the six-year-old Ornstein perform. Hofmann gave him a letter of recommendation to the highly regarded St. Petersburg Conservatory. Soon after, Ornstein was accepted as a pupil at the Imperial School of Music in Kiev, then headed by Vladimir Puchalsky. A <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> forced Ornstein's return home. In 1903, Osip Gabrilovich heard him play and recommended him to the Moscow Conservatory. In 1904, the eight-year-old Ornstein auditioned for and was accepted by the St. Petersburg school. There he studied composition with Alexander Glazunov and piano with Anna Yesipova. By the age of eleven, Ornstein was earning his way by coaching opera singers. To escape the pogroms incited by the nationalist and antisemitic organisation Union of the Russian People, the family emigrated to the United States in February 1906. They settled in New York's Lower East Side, and Ornstein enrolled in the Institute of Musical Art—predecessor to the Juilliard School—where he studied piano with Bertha Feiring Tapper. In 1911, he made a well-received New York debut with pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Schumann. Recordings two years later of works by Chopin, Grieg, and Poldini demonstrate, according to music historian Michael Broyles, [...] "a pianist of sensitivity, prodigious technical ability, and artistic maturity." ...|$|E
