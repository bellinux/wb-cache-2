The <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre-associated {{lymphoma}} gene {{is specifically}} expressed in germinal centre B-lymphocytes and germinal centre-derived B-cell lymphomas, but its function is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre-associated lymphoma directly binds to Syk in B cells, increases its kinase activity on B-cell receptor stimulation {{and leads to}} enhanced activation of Syk downstream effectors. To further investigate these findings in vivo, <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre-associated lymphoma transgenic mice were generated. Starting from 12 months of age these mice developed polyclonal B-cell lymphoid hyperplasia, hypergammaglobulinemia and systemic reactive amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, leading to shortened survival. The lymphoid hyperplasia in the <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre-associated lymphoma transgenic mice are likely attributable to enhanced B-cell receptor signalling as shown by increased Syk phosphorylation, ex vivo B-cell proliferation and increased RhoA activation. Overall, our study shows {{for the first time}} that the <b>germinal</b> centre protein <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre-associated lymphoma regulates B-cell receptor signalling in B-lymphocytes which, without appropriate control, may lead to B-cell lymphoproliferation.

In these mixed populations, hybrid frogs (R. esculenta) outnumbered parental ones (R. lessonae). Despite variation in parasite intensity and demographic variability among populations, the relationship between host age and intensity of parasitism suggests a higher susceptibility in parentals than in hybrids. Mortality is probably enhanced by lung parasites in parental frogs. On the other hand, while parental frogs harboured higher numbers of H. cylindracea than hybrid frogs, the latter had higher numbers of R. bufonis.

Methods We analysed BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes by direct sequencing and MLPA. We confirmed the results by an alternative MLPA kit and characterized the BRCA 1 deletion by Array CGH. Results We describe the first case of a patient with no strong family history of the disease who developed early-onset bilateral breast cancer with a de novo complete BRCA 1 gene deletion in the <b>germinal</b> <b>line.</b> The detected deletion started from the region surrounding the VAT 1 locus to the beginning of NBR 1 gene, including the RND 2, Ψ BRCA 1, BRCA 1 and NBR 2 complete genes.

40|$|During {{secondary}} immunoglobulin (Ig) diversification in vertebrates, {{the sequence}} of the variable region of Ig genes may be altered by templated or non-templated mechanisms. In both cases, cytidine deamination by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in the transcribed Ig loci leads to DNA lesions, which are repaired by conservative homologous recombination (HR) during Ig gene conversion, or by non-templated mutagenesis during somatic hypermutation. The molecular basis for the differential use of these two pathways in different species is unclear. While experimental ablation of HR in avian cells performing Ig gene conversion may promote a switch to somatic hypermutation, the activity of HR processes in intrinsically hypermutating mammalian cells has not been measured to date. Employing a functional HR assay in <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> centre like B cell lines, we detect elevated HR activity that can be enhanced by transcription and AID.

Although each subset contained RB+ cells, when {{used as an}} intrasubset marker, differential RB expression effectively discriminated between phenotypically distinct cells. For example, RB+ GC B cells were enriched for activated cells with lower AID expression. RB inversely correlated with mutation frequency, demonstrating a key difference between RB- and RO-expressing GC B cells. Reduced RB expression during the transition from pre-GC (IgM+IgD+CD 38 +CD 27 −) to GCB cells {{was followed by a}} dramatic increase during the GC-to-plasmablast (IgD−CD 38 ++CD 27 +) and memory (IgD−CD 38 −CD 27 +) transition.

We defined 6 memory B-cell subsets based on their antigen-experienced phenotype and differential expression of CD 27 and IgH isotypes. Molecular characterization of their replication history, Ig somatic hypermutation, and class-switch profiles demonstrated their origin from 3 different pathways. CD 27 -IgG+and CD 27 +IgM+B cells are derived from primary germinal center reactions, and CD 27 +IgA+and CD 27 +IgG+B cells are from consecutive germinal center responses (pathway 1). In contrast, natural effector and CD 27 -IgA+memory B cells have limited proliferation and are also present in CD 40 L-deficient patients, reflecting a germinal center-independent origin. Natural effector cells at least in part originate from systemic responses in the splenic marginal zone (pathway 2).

In Burkitt lymphoma (BL) aberrant c-Myc activity results from IG-MYC translocations. However, MYC aberrations {{are not limited}} to BLs and then have a negative prognostic impact. In this study, we investigated to which extent aberrant c-Myc activity plays a functional role in other aNHL and whether it is independent from MYC translocations. Based on a combined microarray analysis of <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> center (GC) B cells transfected with c-Myc and 220 aNHLs cases, we developed a "c-Myc index.

This supports the view that aberrant c-Myc expression in GC B cells triggers a tumor-like expression pattern. As expected, the "c-Myc index" is very high in molecular Burkitt lymphoma (mBL), but more importantly also high within other aNHL. It constitutes a negative prognostic marker independent of established risk factors and of the presence of a MYC translocation.

We have measured telomere length in <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> vesicle (GV) oocytes and preimplantation embryos, by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH), providing baseline data towards our hypothesis that telomere length is a marker of embryo quality. The numbers of fluorescent foci suggest that extensive clustering of telomeres occurs in mature GV stage oocytes, and in preimplantation embryos. When calculating average telomere length by assuming that each signal presents one telomere, the calculated telomere length decreased from the oocyte to the cleavage stages, and increased between the cleavage stages and the blastocyst (11. 12 versus 8. 43 versus 12. 22 kb, respectively, P < 0. 001). Other methods of calculation, based upon expected maximum and minimum numbers of telomeres, confirm that telomere length in blastocysts is significantly longer than cleavage stages.

40|$|The p 53 gene {{is located}} on the small arm of {{chromosome}} 17 and mutations or hyperexpression are found in a high percentage of ovarian cancer cases (44 - 92 %). We studied DNA extracted from blood leukocytes of 38 ovarian cancer patients; tumor tissues were also available for analysis in 20 of these cases. Specimens were examined using Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct genomic sequencing of the p 53 gene. Exons from 2 to 11 were studied in blood and tumoral tissues. Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing showed that seven patients (18. 4 %) had a germline alteration of the p 53 gene, but only two of them (5. 2 %) led to an amino acid change. The other five patients had only a silent mutation which does not change the amino acid (two patients) or had intronic mutations (four patients) whose interpretation is uncertain. Somatic mutations of the p 53 gene were found in nine of the 20 tumoral tissues (45 %). One tumor contained two mutations in the p 53 gene (no. 9). Our study, though preliminary and based on a small group of patients, suggests that classic p 53 mutations in sporadic ovarian cancer cases are common, but they are not generally found in the <b>germinal</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R
40|$|Human {{histocompatibility}} leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DO, a lysosomal resident major {{histocompatibility complex}} class II molecule expressed in B cells, has previously {{been shown to be}} a negative regulator of HLA-DM peptide loading function. We analyze the expression of DO in human peripheral blood, lymph node, tonsil, and bone marrow to determine if DO expression is modulated in the physiological setting. B cells, but not monocytes or monocyte-derived dendritic cells, are observed to express this protein. Preclearing experiments demonstrate that � 50 % of HLA-DM is bound to DO in peripheral blood B cells. HLA-DM and HLA-DR expression is demonstrated early in B cell development, beginning at the pro-B stage in adult human bone marrow. In contrast, DO expression is initiated only after B cell development is complete. In all situations, there is a striking correlation between intracellular DO expression and cell surface class II–associated invariant chain peptide expression, which suggests that DO substantially inhibits DM function in primary human B cells. We report that the expression of DO is markedly downmodulated in <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> center B cells. Modulation of DO expression may provide a mechanism to regulate peptide loading activity and antigen presentation by B cells during the development of humoral immune responses.

40|$|HGAL protein can be myristoylated and palmitoylated, {{and these}} {{modifications}} localize HGAL to lipid rafts. • Raft localization of HGAL protein facilitates interaction with Syk, and modulation of BCR activation and signaling. <b>Human</b> <b>germinal</b> center–associated lymphoma (HGAL) is specifically expressed only in germinal center (GC) B lymphocytes and GC-derived lymphomas. HGAL protein decreases lymphocyte motility by inhibiting {{the ability of}} myosin to translocate actin via direct interaction with F-actin and myosin II and by activating RhoA signaling via direct interactions with RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors. HGALprotein also regulatesB-cell receptor (BCR) signaling bydirectly binding to and enhancing Syk kinase activity and activation of its downstream effectors. Herein we demonstrate that HGALprotein can bemyristoylated and palmitoylated and that these modifications localize HGAL to cellular membrane raft microdomains with distinct consequences for BCR signaling and chemoattractant-induced cell mobility. In BCR signaling, raft localization of HGAL facilitates interaction with Syk and modulation of the BCR activation and signaling, which induces HGAL phosphorylation and redistribution from lipid raft to bulk membrane and cytoplasm, followedbydegradation. In contrast, HGAL myristoylation and palmitoylation avert its inhibitory effects on chemoattractant-induced cell motility. These findings further elucidate the growing and complex role of HGAL in B-cell biology and suggest that membrane-bound and cytoplasmic HGAL protein differently regulates distinct biological processes.

40|$|The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), or stress-activated {{protein kinase}} plays {{a crucial role}} in {{cellular}} responses stimulated by environmental stress and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms that lead to the activation of the JNK pathway have not been elucidated. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase that has significant sequence similarities to <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> center kinase (GCK) and human hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1. The novel GCK-like kinase (GLK) has a nucleotide sequence that encodes an ORF of 885 amino acids with 11 kinase subdomains. Endogenous GLK could be activated by UV radiation and proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α. When transiently expressed in 293 cells, GLK specifically activated the JNK, but not the p 42 / 44 MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p 38 kinase signaling pathways. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 353 – 835 in the putative C-terminal regulatory region, or mutation of Lys- 35 in the putative ATP-binding domain, markedly reduced the ability of GLK to activate JNK. This result indicates that both kinase activity and the C-terminal region of GLK are required for maximal activation of JNK. Furthermore, GLK-induced JNK activation could be inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK 1) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 /SAPK/ERK kinase 1 (SEK 1), suggesting that GLK may function upstream of MEKK 1 in the JNK signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{spontaneous}} mutation resulting in electrophoretic variants per cell generation {{in a human}} lymphoblastoid cell line, {{on the basis of}} experiments described in this paper, is found to be 7. 2 x 10 (- 8) per locus. A review of similar data on electrophoretic variants resulting from spontaneous mutation in the human germ line leads to an estimate of 3. 3 x 10 (- 8) per locus per cell generation. It is argued that the similarity of these two estimates, despite an average cell generation time of 18. 5 hr for the cultured somatic cells but about 26 days in the germ line, suggests that spontaneous mutation involving nucleotide substitutions is much more dependent on cell generation than on time. This finding permits the inference that environmental (exogenous) variables make a relatively small contribution to the rate of this type of <b>human</b> <b>germinal</b> spontaneous mutation. While in vitro somatic-cell mutation rates, such as derived in this study, provide a basis for modeling the contribution of nucleotide substitutions in multihit/clonal theories of carcinogenesis, it is also argued that the complex of events involved in carcinogenesis, including chromosomal rearrangements and mitotic recombination, could have very different individual probabilities. Estimates for the rates of these other types of mutation are needed to provide {{a better understanding of the}} manner in which multiple mutations accumulate in malignant cells...|$|R
40|$|Primordial {{germ cells}} (PGCs) {{are the only}} cells in {{developing}} embryos {{with the potential to}} transmit genetic information to the next generation, making them excellent candidates for gene banking and cryopreservation (Saito et al., 2008). PGCs originate from the germ cell line, producing spermatogonia and oogonia, which, in turn, preserve two main functions: self-renewal and production of gametes. The potential of primordial germ cells to resume gametogenesis after intra- or inter-specific grafting has been reported for a limited number of species during the last years (Takeuchi et al., 2004; Yoshizaki et al., 2010). These findings opened great expectations for the development of new biotechnologies in aquaculture, the possibility to generate germ-line quimeras for surrogate production being one of the most suggested option. Recent studies showed that this ability is maintained in more differentiated cells of the <b>germinal</b> <b>line,</b> the spermatogonia (Okutsu et al., 2006; Lacerda et al., 2010; Yazawa et al., 2010), which are easier to obtain from immature testes. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to evaluate the use of these tools in the conservation programmes of brown trout populations from the Northwest of Spain, which are threatened by extinction. In this work we wanted to check the effectiveness of the protocols for testes dissociation and spermatogonia enrichment of this species and evaluate the ability of cells to colonize the host gonads after intra-specific grafting.
