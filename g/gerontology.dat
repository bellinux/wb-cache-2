5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of health and}} illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This sub-field also overlaps with <b>gerontology</b> {{and the study of}} the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has several}} {{public and private}} {{hospitals}} and specialised medical institutions, such as a psychiatric hospital, two obstetric hospitals, a <b>gerontology</b> hospital and institutes for respiratory and ocular diseases. In 2012, Skopje had a ratio of one physician per 251.6 inhabitants, a figure {{higher than the national}} ratio (one per 370.9). The ratio of medical specialists was also higher than {{in the rest of the}} country. However, the ratio of hospital beds, pharmacists and dentists was lower in Skopje. The population in Skopje enjoys better health standards than other Macedonians. In 2010, the mortality rate was at 8.6‰ in Skopje and 9.3‰ on the national level. The infant mortality rate was at 6.8‰ in Skopje and 7.6‰ in Macedonia.|$|E

25|$|Gerontological Education has {{flourished in}} the United States since 1967 and degrees at all {{academic}} levels are now offered {{by a number of}} colleges and universities. One of the pioneering gerontologists, Robert Neil Butler, pushed for care and respect of the elderly. Several university-based centers on aging have been founded such as the Duke University Center on Aging, the University of Georgia Institute of <b>Gerontology,</b> the Center of Aging at the University of Chicago, and the Stanford Center on Longevity. Currently, PhD programs in <b>gerontology</b> are available at Miami University, the University of Kansas, University of Kentucky, University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Massachusetts Boston, and the University of Southern California.|$|E

25|$|Social <b>gerontology</b> is a multi-disciplinary {{sub-field}} {{that specializes}} in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, nursing, psychology, sociology, demography, public health, or other social science disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.|$|E
25|$|Old {{people often}} have limited {{regenerative}} abilities {{and are more}} susceptible to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called senescence, the medical study of the aging process is called <b>gerontology,</b> and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics. The elderly also face other social issues around retirement, loneliness, and ageism.|$|E
25|$|St. Thomas University (STU) is the province's only Catholic {{university}} {{and has been}} located in Fredericton since 1964, when it moved from its Chatham, New Brunswick campus.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{successful}} ageing {{can be traced}} back to the 1950s and was popularised in the 1980s. Previous research into ageing exaggerated the extent to which health disabilities, such as diabetes or osteoporosis, could be attributed exclusively to age and research in <b>gerontology</b> exaggerated the homogeneity of samples of elderly people. Other research shows that even late in life, potential exists for physical, mental, and social growth and development.|$|E
25|$|Downs {{earned a}} {{postgraduate}} degree in <b>gerontology</b> from Hunter College {{while he was}} hosting Over Easy, a PBS television program about aging that aired from 1977 to 1983.

25|$|In {{the medieval}} Islamic world, several {{physicians}} wrote on {{issues related to}} <b>Gerontology.</b> Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine (1025) offered instruction {{for the care of}} the aged, including diet and remedies for problems including constipation. Arabic physician Ibn Al-Jazzar Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.4). His scholarly work covers sleep disorders, forgetfulness, how to strengthen memory, and causes of mortality Ishaq ibn Hunayn (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).|$|E
25|$|Key Concepts in Social <b>Gerontology</b> lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social. Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental. Chronological age {{may differ}} {{considerably}} from a person's functional age. The distinguishing marks {{of old age}} normally occur in all five senses at different times and different rates for different persons. In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in Daley Plaza, which features cultural acts and food tastings {{from the other}} cities. In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges. In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health & Society at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University and the Institute of <b>Gerontology</b> of Ukraine (originally of the Soviet Union), that was originally established {{as part of the}} Chicago-Kiev sister cities program.|$|E

25|$|The field {{first began}} {{to emerge in the}} 1930s during the first studies on {{behavioral}} and social <b>gerontology,</b> and were associated with deterministic explanations of the relationship between aging and environment from genetic parameters and biological. In the 1970s and 1980s, theories of different researchers, as Kurt Lewin (living space model {{as a function of the}} person and the environment) and, mainly, M. Powell Lawton (1923–2001) (ecological adaptation model), based on the influence of the interactions between the older person and their environment (adaptation – ambient pressure), confirm the importance of the physical and social environment (objective and subjective) in the understanding of the aging population and the possibility of improving the quality of life in old age.|$|E
25|$|Disengagement {{theory is}} the idea that {{separation}} of older people from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. Disengagement theory, first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in <b>gerontology,</b> but has been much criticised. The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample of older adults in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory. There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{clinical}} psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although {{the exact number}} of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of <b>gerontology,</b> sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the University of Georgia {{acquired}} the former U.S. Navy Supply Corps School {{on the medical}} corridor of Prince Avenue near downtown Athens. The two primary occupants of the 56-acre Health Sciences Campus are the AU-UGA Medical Partnership and the UGA College of Public Health. The campus has an extensive landscaped green space, more than 400 trees and several historic buildings. The majority of classes for both medical and public health students are held in Russell Hall, {{not to be confused}} with the South campus undergraduate residence hall, which was built in 1974. The nearly 63,000 square-foot building includes rooms for small group and clinical skills teaching, a lab for gross anatomy, pathology and histology, a medical library, faculty offices, and classroom space. The AU-UGA Medical Partnership administrative offices are housed in Winnie Davis Hall, which was built in 1902. In 2013, it was announced that St. Mary's Hospital, Northeast Georgia Health System and Athens Regional Medical Center would be utilized as teaching hospitals and residency sites for the Medical Partnership students. The College of Public Health's administrative offices are housed in Rhodes Hall, which was built in 1906. Six of the College's seven units are now located on the Health Sciences Campus, including the Institute of <b>Gerontology</b> in Hudson Hall, the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in B.S. Miller Hall, and Departments of Health Policy and Management and Health Promotion and Behavior in Wright Hall.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 1940s that pioneers like James Birren began {{organizing}} <b>gerontology</b> into its own field. Recognizing that there were experts in many fields all dealing with the older population, it became apparent that a group like the Gerontological Society of America (founded in 1945) was needed. Two decades later, James Birren was appointed as the founding director of the first academic research center devoted exclusively to the study of aging, the Ethel Percy Andrus <b>Gerontology</b> Center. The Baltimore Longitudinal Studies of Aging began in 1958 in order to study physiological changes in healthy middle-aged and older men living in the community by testing them every two years on numerous physiological parameters. In 1967, the University of South Florida and the University of North Texas (formerly North Texas State University) received Older Americans Act training grants from the U.S. Administration on Aging to launch the nation's first degree programs in <b>gerontology,</b> at the master's level. In 1975, the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of <b>Gerontology,</b> [...] became the country's first school of <b>gerontology</b> within a university and, later, offered the first PhD in <b>Gerontology</b> degree.|$|E
