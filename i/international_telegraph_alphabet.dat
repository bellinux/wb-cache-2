40|$|Émile Baudot’s {{printing}} telegraph was {{the first}} widely adopted device to encode letters, numbers, and symbols as uniform-length binary sequences. Donald Murray introduced a second successful code of this type, the details of which continued to evolve until versions of Baudot’s and Murray’s codes were standardized as <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabets</b> No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. These codes were used for decades before the appearance of computers and the changing needs of communications required the design and standardization of a new code. Years of debate and compromise resulted in the ECMA- 6 standard in Europe, the ASCII standard in the United States, and the ISO 646 and International Alphabet No. 5 standards internationally.

50|$|In 1924, the CCITT {{introduced}} the <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) code {{as an international}} standard, {{which was based on}} the Western Union code with some minor changes.

50|$|The Baudot code, {{invented by}} Émile Baudot, is a {{character}} set predating EBCDIC and ASCII. It was the predecessor to the <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2), the teleprinter code in use until the advent of ASCII. Each character in the alphabet is represented {{by a series of}} five bits, sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire or a radio signal. The symbol rate measurement is known as baud, and is derived from the same name.|$|E
5000|$|Gerke {{perceived}} the disadvantages of the American Morse code and changed {{nearly half of}} it into its present form, the <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet.</b> The original Morse code consisted of four different hold durations (the amount of time the key was held down), and some letters contained inconsistent internal durations of silence. In Gerke's system there are only [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs", the latter being three times {{as long as the}} former, and the internal silence intervals are always a single dit-time each. This new code was first adopted by the Deutsch-Oesterreichischer Telegraphenverein and in 1865 accepted by a convent of the International Telegraph Union in Paris.|$|E
50|$|The X3.2 {{subcommittee}} designed ASCII {{based on}} the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols (i.e. graphemes and control characters). This allows digital devices {{to communicate with each}} other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters, 10 numerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT) <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2) standard of 1924, FIELDATA (1956), and early EBCDIC (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-E protocol is {{an extension}} of the CCITT <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send.|$|R

50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2. In the late days of the telex networks, end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{teleprinters}} {{used the}} 5-bit <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA2). This limited the character set to 32 codes (25 = 32). One {{had to use}} a [...] "FIGS" [...] shift key to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used asynchronously with start and stop bits: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as FIELDATA and Flexowriter, were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.|$|E
50|$|Text was {{encoded in}} several ways. The {{earliest}} standard character encoding was Baudot, which {{dates back to}} the nineteenth century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed), Western Union code, <b>International</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Alphabet</b> No. 2 (ITA 2), and American Teletypewriter code (USTTY), were used. Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as ASCII. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.|$|E
