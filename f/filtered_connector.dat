40|$|A {{method to}} {{describe}} barriers such as <b>filters,</b> cables, <b>connectors</b> etc. with circuits consisting of linear discrete components is presented. The circuit is constructed by viewing the barrier as a multiconductor transmission line {{for which the}} per-unit length parameters have to be determined. A developed two-dimensional finite difference program in which the cross-section is defined by drawing it using the CAD-like user interface computes these. For barriers that cannot be viewed as transmission lines a method for determining equivalent circuits outgoing from measured S-parameters has been developed. The derived models {{have been used in}} SPICE and validated by comparison with measurements. Godkänd; 2000; 20061029 (ysko) </p...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the extra}} traffic the West Gate Freeway was attracting—and {{due to the}} safety {{concerns}} of having excess traffic <b>filter</b> through <b>connector</b> streets in South Melbourne—the freeway was finally extended to Kings Way above the Grant Street intersection using elevated carriageways in 1987. Expansion of the original two lane freeway {{on the western side}} of the bridge to three lanes each way was carried out in 1993, and expansion to four lanes followed in 2000. With the subsequent completion of the Western Ring Road joining the West Gate Interchange to the freeway's west and CityLink to the freeway's east, it also funnels traffic from northern and western suburbs around Melbourne, acting as a bypass freeway.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} {{to perform the}} model-order reduction (MOR) of multiport systems under the effect of statistical variability of geometrical or electrical parameters. The proposed approach combines a deterministic MOR phase {{with the use of}} the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion to perform the variability analysis of the system under study very efficiently. The combination of MOR and PC techniques generates a final reduced-order model able to accurately perform stochastic computations and variability analysis. The novel proposed method guarantees a high-degree of flexibility, since different MOR schemes can be used and different types of modern electrical systems (e. g., <b>filters</b> and <b>connectors)</b> can be modeled. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach is verified by means of two numerical examples and compared with other existing variability analysis techniques...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} a detector package to house a superconducting bolometer array, SQUID multiplexers, bias and integration circuitry, optical <b>filtering,</b> electrical <b>connectors,</b> and thermal/mechanical interfaces. This package {{has been used}} successfully in the GISMO 2 mm camera, a 128 -pixel camera operating at a base temperature of 270 mK. Operation at lower temperatures is allowed by providing direct heat sinking to the SQUIDS and bias resistors, which generate {{the bulk of the}} dissipation in the package. Standard electrical connectors provide reliable contact while enabling quick installation and removal of the package. Careful design has gone into the compensation for differing thermal expansions, the need for heat sinking of the bolometer array, and the placement of magnetic shielding in critical areas. In this presentation, we detail the design and performance of this detector package and describe its scalability to 1280 - pixel arrays in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Pipes and filters is {{a popular}} {{architecture}} which connects computational components (<b>filters)</b> through <b>connectors</b> (pipes) so that computations are performed in a stream like fashion. The data are transported through the pipes between filters, gradually transforming inputs to outputs. This kind of stream processing has been made popular through UNIX pipes that serially connect independent components for performing a sequence of tasks. We show in this paper how to foralize this architecture in terms of monads, hereby including relational specifications as special cases. The system is given through a directed acyclic graph the nodes of which carry the computational structure by being labelled with morphisms from the monad, and the edges provide the data for these operations. It is shown how fundamental compositional operations like combining pipes and filters, and refining a system by replacing simple parts through more elaborate ones, are supported through this construction. A notion of bisimular pipes and filters is introduced, it is shown that bisimilarity of components carries over to bisimilarity of entire systems...|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} a high power intermodulation measurement set-up capable of delivering 30 W {{in each of}} two fundamental tones. For closely spaced frequencies (less than 35 MHz), the dynamic range of the measurement {{is limited by the}} nonlinear performance of the mixer in {{the front end of the}} HP 71210 C spectrum analyzer. A tunable TE(sub 011) mode copper cavity was fabricated in which one of the endwalls could be adjusted shifting its resonant frequency between 5. 7 and 6. 6 GHz. Since the Q-value of this cavity is high, greater than 10 (exp 4), and its bandwidth is small, less than 1 MHz, it can be used to attenuate the two fundamental tones relative to one of the harmonic tones, which greatly enhances the dynamic range of the measurement. This set-up can be used to measure the two-tone intermodulation distortion of any passive microwave device, e. g. a HTS <b>filter,</b> a <b>connector,</b> a cable, etc., over a frequency range of 5. 9 to 6. 4 GHz and a power range of 0. 1 to 30 W. The third order intercept (TOI) of a prototype HTS filter measured at powers up to 30 W was + 81. 3 dBm...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} debate on what “ubiquity” in {{ubiquitous}} computing implies, {{in particular in}} regard to technological affordances connecting people. The aim {{of this article is}} to explore the question: What is the role of technologically embedded assumptions in the cultivation of interaction ubiquity at work? Distinguishing between the embedded support for managing ongoing interaction relationships—as opposed to a series of interaction encounters—and the support for prioritizing interactions—as opposed to priorities per se—yields four analytical categories of affordances: <b>connectors,</b> <b>filters,</b> mediators, and coordinators. These four categories are illustrated through four case studies of mobile working. The author argues that successful cultivation of interaction ubiquity at work relies critically on a portfolio approach wherein the technology is seen as playing a more active role in the management of interaction beyond the simple standardized technical connection...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{has recently been}} focused on efficient means to reduce electromagnetic interference due to timing signals, such as the clock signals widely employed in digital circuits, or the control pulse-trains used in switching power converters. We here focus on the methodologies where electromagnetic compatibility is enhanced by means of signal processing techniques {{rather than relying on}} shields and <b>filtered</b> cables and <b>connectors.</b> More specifically, the introduction of a suitably defined modulation in the timing-signal generation process allows to disrupt its periodicity or quasi-periodicity and to spread the signal energy, thus reducing its power density spectrum (PDS) peak and the interference. Here we show that the ability to design chaotic circuits with prescribed statistical features can profitably be exploited to achieve a reduction of at least to 6 dB in the peak power spectral density with respect to all other published and patented method...|$|R

40|$|Solar System Exploration camera {{implementations}} to date {{have involved}} either single cameras with wide field-of-view (FOV) and consequently coarser spatial resolution, cameras on a movable mast, or single cameras necessitating rotation of the host vehicle to afford visibility outside a relatively narrow FOV. These cameras require detailed commanding from the ground or separate onboard computers to operate properly, and are incapable of making decisions based on image content that control pointing and downlink strategy. For color, a filter wheel having selectable positions was often added, which added moving parts, size, mass, power, and reduced reliability. A system was developed based on a general-purpose miniature visible-light camera using advanced CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) imager technology. The baseline camera has a 92 FOV and six cameras are arranged in an angled-up carousel fashion, with FOV overlaps such that the system has a 360 FOV (azimuth). A seventh camera, also with a FOV of 92, is installed normal to {{the plane of the}} other 6 cameras giving the system a > 90 FOV in elevation and completing the hemispheric vision system. A central unit houses the common electronics box (CEB) controlling the system (power conversion, data processing, memory, and control software). Stereo is achieved by adding a second system on a baseline, and color is achieved by stacking two more systems (for a total of three, each system equipped with its own <b>filter.)</b> Two <b>connectors</b> {{on the bottom of the}} CEB provide a connection to a carrier (rover, spacecraft, balloon, etc.) for telemetry, commands, and power. This system has no moving parts. The system's onboard software (SW) supports autonomous operations such as pattern recognition and tracking...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{intermodulation}} (PIM) causes unwanted distortion {{signals in}} high power radio {{systems such as}} satellite links, wireless base stations, and harmonic radars. In general passive wireless components such as cables, <b>connectors,</b> <b>filters,</b> and antennas are linear and thus do not create intermodulation. However, under high powers this is sometimes not the case and PIM is generated. The physical mechanisms causing PIM are not well understood, partially because they are difficult to measure. Furthermore strategies to reduce PIM in system design are sparse. ^ In this thesis PIM measurement techniques are developed and demonstrated which enable differentiation and physical understanding of PIM leading to reduction of PIM in future high power systems. First, measuring higher order intermodulation products is shown to reveal significant information about the PIM source. For example, this information allows the differentiation of two types of coaxial connectors which would appear identical using standard PIM measurement techniques. Second, the standing wave of voltage and current inside a resonator is used to increase the voltage and current selectively at the PIM source. This method extends the measurement sensitivity of any system, and also allows differentiation between voltage and current induced PIM sources. Finally, two mitigation techniques are presented which leverage measurement capabilities developed in this thesis to give low PIM design techniques for systems. The first is a method for designing matching networks to reduce the effect of PIM generating components, and the second uses a magnetically tunable network to cancel PIM sources. ...|$|R
