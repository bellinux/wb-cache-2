5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
5|$|I Corps {{is unique}} among the active US Army corps <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of a mixture of active duty and US Army Reserve units in 47 of the 50 U.S. states, {{for a total of}} around 20,000 active duty and 20,000 army reserve forces.|$|E

5|$|In Shodokan Aikido, randori differs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{performed}} with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo randori.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage. The {{name of this}} species {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leukos 'white' and notos 'back'. Birds in the southern parts of its range tend to be smaller than those in the north.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Evermore {{is unique}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the only game}} {{developed}} by Square designers in North America.

5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.|$|E
5|$|Styloolithus, another fossil enantiornithine egg {{from the}} Gobi, differs from Gobioolithus <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> larger {{and has a}} thicker eggshell with a proportionately smaller mammillary layer. Laevisoolithids, which are also eggs of enantiornithines, are also larger than Gobioolithus, {{but they have a}} much thicker mammillary layer.|$|E
5|$|The Apiary Laboratory, {{more often}} {{referred}} to as the Apiary, is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations.

5|$|The Church Administration Building (CAB) is an {{administrative}} {{office building in}} Salt Lake City, Utah, United States serving as the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. Completed in 1917, the building is adjacent to Temple Square, between the Joseph Smith Memorial Building and the Lion House, on South Temple Drive.

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams places {{it and the}} {{immediate}} area in two different level three eco-regions: the Cascades eco-region and the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Within these two eco-regions are five level four eco-regions: the Western Cascade Mountain Highlands, Cascade Crest Montane Forest, and Cascades Subalpine/Alpine within the Cascades eco-region and the Yakima Plateau and Slopes and Grand Fir Mixed Forest within the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Adams is unique among the Washington volcanoes <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in two level three eco-regions {{as well as being}} the only one within the Cascade Crest Montane Forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{invisible}} rail is superficially {{similar to}} the purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, which has recently been found in Halmahera, but that species is larger, with a short, thick red bill and a red forehead shield; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail. The invisible rail {{is different from the}} Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species; there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species.|$|E
50|$|Crockett-Stark's {{first race}} for House of Delegates in 2005 <b>was</b> notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the only {{incumbent}} Democratic {{loss in the}} House during the 2005 election cycle. She defeated Benny Keister, a three-term member.|$|R
50|$|Foxfire <b>is</b> {{historically}} notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the last}} American film {{to be shot}} in three-strip Technicolor, which process had been displaced by the coarser-grained and less chromatically saturated, but much cheaper, Eastmancolor single-strip process.|$|R
50|$|Although making {{locomotives}} was {{its main}} business, Dübs & Co also manufactured traction engines and steam cranes. His company <b>is</b> further notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first to}} employ women in its drawing office (from 1866).|$|R
5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper.

The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} of PSR B1937+21, {{along with other}} millisecond pulsars discovered later, are very stable in their rotation. They are capable of keeping {{time as well as}} atomic clocks. PSR B1937+21 is unusual <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one of few pulsars which occasionally emits particularly strong pulses. The flux density of the giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are the brightest radio emission ever observed. These properties of PSR B1937+21, and its unexpected discovery, are credited with helping revitalize research on pulsars.|$|E
5|$|The {{villages of}} La Grace, Piaye and Laborie in the {{southwest}} area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song-dance called the koutoumba. The koutoumba was only performed {{for the death of}} a djiné, a person descended from Africans who came to the island {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The koutoumba is unique among Lucian folk dance <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> performed by a sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text, which is evocative of the song's atmosphere rather than narrative. The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The British Army was {{different}} from the French and German Armies {{at the beginning of the}} conflict <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made up from volunteers, not conscripts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also considerably smaller than its French and German counterparts.|$|R

5|$|This is an {{exhibition}} of contemporary art, {{not in the sense}} that it was done recently, but <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> cased in the mentality, technology and philosophy of radical art of the most recent times. No one, other than the Aborigines of Australia, has succeeded in exhibiting such art at the Hermitage.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices {{may or may not}} support hot-swapping).|$|E
5|$|Z-Trans is {{the mass}} transit system, {{providing}} paratransit and scheduled service {{within the city}} center and to White Sands Mall, Holloman Air Force Base and Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort & Casino in Mescalero.
