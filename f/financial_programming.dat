40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>financial</b> {{incentive}} <b>programs,</b> which have become an increasingly common component of welfare programs. We review experimental evidence from several such <b>programs.</b> <b>Financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> appear to increase work and raise income (lower poverty), but cost somewhat more than alternative welfare programs. In particular, windfall beneficiaries [...] those {{who would have been}} working anyway [...] can raise costs by participating in the program. Several existing programs limit this effect by targeting long-term welfare recipients or by limiting benefits to full-time workers. At the same time, because <b>financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> transfer support to working low-income families, the increase in costs due to windfall beneficiaries makes these programs more effective at alleviating poverty and raising incomes. Evidence also indicates that combining <b>financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> with job search and job support services can increase both employment and income gains. Non-experimental evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and from state Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs with enhanced earnings disregards also suggests that these programs increase employment, and this evidence is consistent with the experimental evidence on {{the impact of}} <b>financial</b> incentive <b>program.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} {{advocates a}} positive, linear association between relationship investments and relationship performance. Our study challenges this conventional wisdom and advances the extant literature by investigating the potential curvilinear effects of suppliers' different relationship marketing programs (i. e., social, financial, and structural) on dyadic perceptions of relationship value. From {{an analysis of}} 113 buyer-supplier dyads, we found that social programs enhance relationship value synergy, but their effect on relationship value asymmetry between suppliers and buyers follows a U-shaped curve. On the other hand, we observe a positive and increasing returns-to-scale effect of <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> on relationship value synergy and its inverted U-shaped association with supplier's relationship value asymmetry. Interestingly, structural programs increase relationship value synergy and have a stronger effect on increasing relationship value for the supplier than for the buyer. In addition, we find that structural programs are more effective in creating value in long-term relationships than in short-term relationships; therefore, as the relationship with a buying firm ages, managers should consider investing more in structural programs to develop their relationship. However, in long-term relationships, managers should avoid investing too much in <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> because <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> are less effective in increasing creation of relationship value as a relationship ages...|$|R
