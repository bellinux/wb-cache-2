25|$|For tanker owners, the Six-Day War of 1967 was {{of greater}} importance. The Suez Canal closed until 1975 and freight rates skyrocketed {{because of the}} {{shortage}} of tonnage now ships had to pass the Cape of Good Hope. Even larger tankers were now built, as {{the limitations of the}} Suez Canal were not governing anymore. In only a couple of years the size of tankers quadrupled to more than 500,000 long tons and there were even plans <b>for</b> <b>tankers</b> of 1,000,000 long tons. In 1969 the first ULCC's were built.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's of London, a British {{insurance}} market, {{estimated that}} the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian mariners. The largest of attacks were directed by Iran against Kuwaiti vessels, and on November 1, 1986, Kuwait formally petitioned foreign powers to protect its shipping. The Soviet Union agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States Navy offered to provide protection <b>for</b> <b>tankers</b> flying the U.S. flag on March 7, 1987. Operation Prime Chance was a United States Special Operations Command operation intended to protect U.S.-flagged oil tankers from Iranian attack. The operation took place roughly {{at the same time}} as Operation Earnest Will, the largely Navy effort to escort the tankers through the Persian Gulf. Under international law, an attack on such ships would be treated as an attack on the U.S., allowing the U.S. to retaliate militarily. This support would protect ships headed to Iraqi ports, effectively guaranteeing Iraq's revenue stream for the duration of the war.|$|E
25|$|From 1912 Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — {{founded in}} 1909 by Weetman Pearson {{to develop the}} newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own tanker fleet. They quickly adopted Isherwood's new {{longitudinal}} framing system that allowed much larger ships and a simpler construction process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's pipe line system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused {{a rise in the}} demand <b>for</b> <b>tankers,</b> which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.|$|E

500|$|In 1954 Shell Oil {{developed}} the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) system which classifies tankers of different sizes.

At first, they divided the groups as General Purpose <b>for</b> <b>tankers</b> under Medium Range for ships between 25,000 and [...] and Large Range for the then-enormous ships that were larger than [...] The ships became larger during the 1970s, which prompted rescaling.|$|E
500|$|Within a few days, the Special Operations {{forces had}} {{determined}} the Iranian pattern of activity; the Iranians hid {{during the day}} near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid <b>for</b> <b>tankers.</b> With this knowledge, SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy. The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. After a short but intense firefight, the helicopters sank all three boats. Three days later, in mid-October, an Iranian Silkworm missile hit the tanker Sea Isle City near the oil terminal outside Kuwait City. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack. During Operation Nimble Archer, four destroyers shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field. After the shelling, a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives {{on one of the}} platforms to destroy it. The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform [...] away.

2500|$|Rural {{areas with}} low {{population}} density may not need FSM services if local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. [...] However, {{this is not always}} the case but rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; be difficult <b>for</b> <b>tankers</b> to access and often have limited demand making transport and treatment uneconomic, and affordable for most people. Therefore options such as relocating latrines on-site or sharing decentralized FSM services between nearby villages, or direct burial of waste can be considered and organized.|$|E
2500|$|Sanctions {{tightened}} further when major supertanker {{companies said}} they would stop loading Iranian cargo. Prior attempts to reduce Iran's oil income failed because many vessels are often managed by companies outside the United States and the EU; however, EU actions in January extended the ban to ship insurance. This insurance ban will affect 95 percent of the tanker fleet because their insurance falls under rules governed by European law. [...] "It's the insurance that's completed the ban on trading with Iran," [...] commented one veteran ship broker. This completion of the trading ban left Iran struggling to find a buyer for {{nearly a quarter of}} its annual oil exports. Iran has sought to manage the impact of international sanctions and limit capital outflows by promoting a [...] "resistance economy," [...] replacing imports with domestic goods and banning luxury imports such as computers and mobile phones. [...] This is predicted to lead to an increase in smuggling, as [...] "people {{will find a way to}} smuggle in what the Iranian consumer wants." [...] To sustain oil imports, Iran has also provided domestic insurance <b>for</b> <b>tankers</b> shipping Iranian oil. Iran had hoped to sell more to Chinese and Indian refiners, though such attempts seem unlikely to succeed, particularly since China—the single-largest buyer of Iranian crude—has been curtailing its oil imports from Iran down to half their former level.|$|E

The RBF neural controller uses reinforcement learning strategy to achieve the heading regulation of tanker ship exposed to plant changes and disturbances.

30|$|The {{values for}} {{transport}} volume by pipeline and by LNG tanker {{are shown in}} Fig.  5. Zhang et al. (2013) found that the loss rate (LR) is 0.607  ×  10 − 3 kg/m 3. The volume of gas losses (L t) for pipeline transport can be calculated using Eq. (8). In this paper, we set the distance for LNG transport at 8000  km. According to Lin et al. (2010), for large LNG carriers, the boil-off rate (BR) is usually between 0.05  %/day and 0.1  %/day, where the middle value is 0.075  %/day. Chu (2000) collected data on approximately 108 LNG ships and found the operating speed to be concentrated {{within the range of}} 32.4 – 37  km/h. The average speed is 34.7  km/h, which is the speed used in this paper. Assuming that the recovery rate of BOG (r) is 0.7, the volume of gas losses (L t) <b>for</b> <b>tanker</b> transport can be calculated using Eq. (9). The L t,NG (Table  16) is the sum of the L t for pipeline transport and the L t <b>for</b> <b>tanker</b> transport.|$|R
