30|$|Aim: Automated PET-tracer syntheses are {{essential}} to enable productions in a quick and robust way for (pre)clinical studies [1]. In this study, azide-alkyne <b>Huisgens</b> <b>cycloadditions</b> of 18 F-labelled azide building blocks (azide-BB) with acetylene-ligands are used {{for the development of}} 18 F-labelled PET-tracers for diagnosis of prostate cancer by targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Due to purification issues of the azide-BB’s, the radiochemical yields (RCY) of these click reactions (CR) were low. Automated microfluidic systems, such as the FlowSafe, could improve these syntheses. The advantages of 18 F-labelling in flow-mode comprises the more dynamic mixing and heating of the azide-BB precursor and [18 F]fluoride, leading to higher yields and less side-products due to shorter reaction times and higher surface-to-volume ratios [2]. Therefore, we elaborated an automated synthesis route for 18 F-labelled PSMA-tracers (18 F-PSMA-tracer) in the FlowSafe, using a 2 -steps procedure in which an azide-BB is 18 F-fluorinated in a microreactor, purified by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and subsequently underwent an in-batch CR.|$|R
