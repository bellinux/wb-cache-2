5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that <b>devastated</b> <b>the</b> city of Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming {{from an area}} of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
