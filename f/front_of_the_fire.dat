25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
25|$|Although sati is {{typically}} {{thought of as}} consisting of the procedure in which the widow is placed, or enters, or jumps, upon the funeral pyre of her husband, slight variations in funeral practice have been reported here as well, by region. For example, the mid-17th-century traveler Tavernier claims that in some regions, the sati occurred by construction of a small hut, within which the widow {{and her husband were}} burnt, while in other regions, a pit was dug, in which the husband's corpse was placed along with flammable materials, into which the widow jumped after the fire had started. In mid-nineteenth-century Lombok, an island in today's Indonesia, the local Balinese aristocracy practiced widow suicide on occasion; but only widows of royal descent could burn themselves alive (others were stabbed to death by a kris knife first). At Lombok, a high bamboo platform was erected in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and, when the flames were at their strongest, the widow climbed up the platform and dived into the fire.|$|E

25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic {{who is trying to}} repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the fugitives and their {{supporters}} arrived at Holbeche House {{on the border of}} Staffordshire, they were exhausted.

[...] A spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and another man. At some point between then and the arrival of the Sheriff of Worcester and his men, Bates left the house, possibly with his son and Digby. [...] If he was with the latter, he was captured later the same day and taken to London. Catesby was killed early that day along with Percy, John Wright and his brother Christopher.|$|E
500|$|Riding through pouring rain, the fugitives helped {{themselves}} to arms, ammunition and {{money from the}} vacant home of Lord Windsor at Hewell Grange.

500|$|The BBC had {{previously}} adapted several horror stories as Christmas films, with their series A Ghost Story for Christmas including adaptations of the M. R.

500|$|Back in London, under pain {{of torture}} Fawkes {{had started to}} reveal what he knew, and on 7November the {{government}} named Catesby as a wanted man. Early that morning at Huddington, the remaining outlaws went to confession, before taking the sacrament — in Fraser's opinion, a sign {{that none of them}} thought they had long to live. The party of fugitives, which included those at the centre of the plot, their supporters and Digby's hunting party, by now had dwindled to only thirty-six in number. They continued through pouring rain to Hewell Grange, home of the young Lord Windsor. He was absent however, so they helped themselves to further arms, ammunition, and money. The locals were unsupportive; on hearing that Catesby's party stood for [...] "God and Country", they replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". The party reached Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00pm. Tired and desperate, they spread in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out.

500|$|On 6November, with Fawkes {{maintaining}} his silence, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle {{for supplies}} {{and continued to}} Norbrook to collect weapons. [...] From there they continued their journey to Huddington. [...] Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army. [...] Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their [...] "wicked actions", before himself fleeing. [...] Several priests set out for Warwick, worried {{about the fate of}} their colleagues. [...] They were caught, and then imprisoned in London. [...] Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour. [...] They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason. [...] They continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to 'Pepperhill', the Shropshire residence of Sir John Talbot to gain support but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> to dry out.

500|$|The fugitives reached Catesby's {{family home}} of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6:00pm. [...] Not wanting to {{implicate}} his mother, Catesby {{sent a message}} to Robert, who had just recently arrived there, asking to meet just outside the town. [...] There he told him that Fawkes had been captured. [...] At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his 'hunting party', which included Robert and Thomas's half-brother, John Wintour. [...] He had been invited to join them on 4 November.

[...] Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. [...] They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for [...] "God and country", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". [...] Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. [...] Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. [...] He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. [...] Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was [...] "as much as his life was worth". [...] While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. [...] Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> only for a stray spark to ignite it. [...] While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.|$|E
