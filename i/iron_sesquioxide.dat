40|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>sesquioxide</b> (Fe 2 O 3) {{displays}} {{pressure and}} temperature induced spin and structural transitions. Our calculations show that, density functional theory (DFT), in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, {{is capable of}} capturing both the transitions. The ambient pressure corundum type phase (hematite or alpha-Fe 2 O 3), having R_ 3 c symmetry, gets distorted by the application of pressure and transforms to a distorted corundum type or Rh 2 O 3 (II) phase with Pbcn symmetry, in agreement with recent experiments. GGA + U calculations show the same trend but shift the transition pressures to higher values. Experimentally, {{the onset of the}} structural transition begins {{in the vicinity of the}} spin transition pressure and whether the system undergoes spin transition in the corundum type (HP 1) or in the Rh 2 O 3 (II) type (HP 2) phase, is still a controversial issue. With a relatively simple, but general, octahedral structural parameter, Voct (the octahedral volume around iron ions), we show that in order to acquire a low spin (LS) state from a high spin (HS) one, the system does not necessarily need to change the crystal structure. Rather, the spin transition is a phenomenon that concerns the cation octahedra and the spin state of the system depends mainly on the value of Voct, which is governed by two distinct equations of state, separated by a well defined volume gap, for the HS and LS states respectively. Analysis of the results on the basis of octahedral volume allows to sum up and bridge the gap between two experimental results and thus provides a better description of the system in the region of interest.

50|$|The B Horizon has dark layer where minerals, {{organic matter}} and bases are being illuviated (washed in/accumulated). Below {{this is a}} red/orange layer of <b>iron</b> and {{aluminium}} <b>sesquioxides</b> deposit. Some bases remain in the soil, though others may be lost by throughflow. In many podsols, Iron Pans are created. This can cause water logging which may then saturate the A horizon leading to mottling or a gleyed podsol.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the pedo-climatic {{variation}} in qualitative and quantitative soil sesquioxide contents and soil phosphorus (P) sorption capacities has been studied. In four soils (samples from A horizons) located along a southern Brazilian environmental gradient (EG) shown a decrease in crystallized iron oxides {{with the increase of}} altitude. Hematite and goethite were found at low EG altitudes in association with low soil organic carbon content, and goethite-ferrihydrite and gibbsite were found at high altitudes in association with high organic carbon content. The adsorbed soil P (measured by the remaining P) was predicted by the goethite content, and the desorbed P (measured by successive P extractions using anion exchange resin membranes) was predicted mainly by the goethite and clay content. In subtropical soils, even a smooth environmental gradient could determine the qualitative and quantitative <b>iron</b> and aluminum <b>sesquioxide</b> distributions that control soil P sorption capacities...|$|R
6000|$|Our short se'nnight was not wasted; yet I had {{an uncomfortable}} {{feeling that the}} {{complication}} of the country called for an exploration of months and not hours. Every day some novelty appeared. The watercourses of the Gh√°ts or coast-range were streaked with a heavy, metallic, quartzose black sand which M. Marie vainly attempted to analyze. We afterwards found it in almost every Wady, and running north as far as El-'Akabah; whilst, with few exceptions, all our washings of red earth, chloritic sand, and bruised stone, yielded it and it only. It is apparently the produce of granite and syenite, and it abounds in African Egypt. I was in hopes that tungsten and titaniferous iron would make it valuable for cutlery as the black sand of New Zealand. Experiments in the Citadel, Cairo, produced nothing save magnetic iron with a trace of lead. But according to Colonel Ross, the learned author of [...] "Pyrology, or Fire Chemistry,"[EN#24] it is iserine or magnetic ilmenite, titaniferous iron-sand, containing eighty-eight per cent. of <b>iron</b> (oxides and <b>sesquioxides),</b> with eleven per cent. of titanic acid.|$|R
