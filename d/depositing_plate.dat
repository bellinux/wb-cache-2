40|$|Metallic {{coatings}} {{are produced}} for various purposes, and methods employed for testing their quality vary accordingly. Many tests {{have been developed}} {{in the past to}} determine the various properties of the coatings. Wear-resistance tests are commonly carried out on metallic <b>deposits,</b> <b>plated</b> specifically as a protection for the metal substrate against wear and erosion. A typical example is chromium plated on steel substrates...|$|R
50|$|During bath circulation, any {{particles}} in {{it will become}} also nickel-plated; this effect is used to advantage in processes which <b>deposit</b> <b>plating</b> with particles like silicon carbide (SiC) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). While superior compared to many other plating processes, it is expensive because the process is complex. Moreover, the process is lengthy even for thin layers. When only corrosion resistance or surface treatment is of concern, very strict bath composition and temperature control is not required and the process is used for plating many tons in one bath at once.|$|R

The approach used in the development was to replace nylon separators with inert polymer impregnated zirconia, use electrochemically <b>deposited</b> <b>plates</b> in place of conventional chemically precipitated ones, and use an additive to extend negative plate lifetime. The design has undergone extensive testing using both engineering and protoflight cell configurations...|$|R
40|$|Au-Sn alloys are {{commonly}} used as solder materials in semiconductor industries. In this work, gold-tin alloys have been electroplated from a non-cyanide bath. The effects of bath composition and PC plating factors on compositions of Au-Sn deposits, intermetallic phase formation, and plating rates have been investigated. The transition current density for plating the two different gold-tin intermetallics, Au 5 Sn and AuSn, was shifted to lower current densities at lower ammonium citrate dosage. In addition, <b>deposits</b> <b>plated</b> from solutions with lower ammonium citrate concentrations were denser. Thin film x-ray diffraction analysis showed that only Au 5 Sn or/and AuSn phases are plated out in the deposits. The growth of either Au 5 Sn or AuSn phases showed no preferred orientation...|$|R

40|$|Electrodeposition at {{elevated}} temperatures from a dibasic ammonium citrate-stabilized iron-cobalt electroplating {{solution is}} shown to promote the deposition of a metastable phase. The metastable phase is isostructural to α-Mn. XRD analysis indicated that the α-Mn-type phase begins to be deposited at temperatures between 30 °C and 40 °C. Below this the equilibrium BCC phase is <b>deposited.</b> <b>Plating</b> at 60 °C produced deposits composed completely of the α-Mn-type phase. TEM analysis indicated that increasing the plating temperature refined the deposit’s grain structure and also led to regions with preferred orientation. Annealing of deposits composed of the α-Mn-type phase above its transformation temperature resulted {{in the formation of}} a textured BCC phase. The presence of the α-Mn-type phase led to high deposit coercivities. Annealing of deposits, which resulted in transformation of the α-Mn-type phase to the BCC phase, reduced their coercivities. The coercivities of these films, however, were not reduced to the level of those <b>deposits</b> which were <b>plated</b> as the BCC phase. In deposits completely composed of the BCC phase, either plated as such or transformed, annealing led to higher coercivities. This is attributed to coarsening of the deposit microstructure...|$|R

40|$|For {{chromium}} plating, {{along with}} chromic acid a small quantity of sulphate ion {{is very much}} essential. In the absence of sulphate ion the chrome bath will not produce any bright deposit but will produce only brown film. The sulphate ion is nonually introduced as sulphuric acid {{at a ratio of}} 100 : 1 to chromic acid. In this paper, in order to study the effect of other sulphate ions, it is aimed to study the effect of cations associated with sulphates. The SUlphate to the chrome bath was introduced in the form of sulphuric acid, sodium sulphate, ammonium sulphate, potassium sulphate and chromium sulphate. Hull Cell experiments were carried out to study the nature of the <b>deposit.</b> <b>Plating</b> expe:;ments were also carried out to study the current efficiency, rate of buildup, porosity, hardness, and nature of deposit and the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} of copper and TiN coatings on various bearing substrates to high-load rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is investigated. Special attention {{is given to}} the lubricating characteristics of copper <b>deposited</b> by ion <b>plating,</b> and the wear resistant characteristics of TiN <b>deposited</b> by ion <b>plating</b> and magnetron sputtering techniques. RCF samples of 440 C and AMS 5749 bearing steels were coated. Sputter <b>deposited</b> and ion <b>plated</b> films were on the RCF samples in a range of thickness from about 2000 A to 2 microns. Results showed a marked improvement of the RCF for pure copper tested on 440 C, but a degradation for copper on AMS 5749. It is also found that the 2000 A TiN films behave favorably on the 440 C and AMS 5749 bearing steels at RCF stress levels of 786 ksi. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis were used during the investigation...|$|R
40|$|Thick Ni electrodeposits, with {{thicknesses}} {{ranging from}} 18 to 90 μm, {{have been produced}} from sulfamate baths using very low current densities (1. 5 – 5 mA cm^(− 2)). Increasing grain sizes, with a corresponding decrease in the hardness values, and more columnar grain morphologies were observed with increasing current densities in the deposits. The anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the deposits were found to correlate strongly with the deposit texture, where the change from a dominated orientation at 1. 5 mA cm^(− 2) to a orientation at the higher (5 mA cm^(− 2)) current density led to a corresponding decrease in the indentation modulus values for the respective Ni films. The residual stress values measured in the deposits (75 – 136 MPa) {{were found to be}} comparable to literature values of <b>deposits</b> <b>plated</b> at higher current densities, which rules out any potential advantage from the use of such low current densities for producing lower residual stresses...|$|R
40|$|Researches in {{the area}} of zinc {{coatings}} on steel are rather unending because of the unique properties and the very low cost that it offers. In this paper, the mechanical (wear and hardness) and corrosion behaviours of Zn Coated Mild Steel in 3. 65 % NaCl are described. A thin film of Zn on steel substrates was prepared by electrodeposition technique using Zn particles to form a bath plating solution. Scanning electron microscope and Atomic force microscope were used to study the surface morphology, the topography and the surface adherent properties of the coatings. The crystal particles present were observed by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction spectrometer (EDS). The microhardness of <b>deposited</b> <b>plate,</b> the electrochemical behavior and the corrosion properties of the deposits were investigated by means of Vickers microhardness and polarization measurements. The uniform deposits of Zn showed fine grains and good protection against corrosion as appreciated 75 % hardness value was achieved...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increase}} use of de-icing salts on roads for safety, {{the need for}} improved corrosion resistance of the traditional galvanized automobile bodies has never been greater. In the present work, Zn alloy coatings (Zn-Ni and Zn-Co) were studied {{as an alternative to}} pure Zn coatings. The production of these deposits involved formulation of various acidic (pH of about 5. 5) chloride based solutions. These showed anomalous deposition, that is, alloys were deposited much more easily than expected from the noble behaviour of Ni and Co metals. Coating compositions ranging from 0 to about 37 % Ni and 20 % Co were obtained. The chemical composition of the coatings depended very much on the electrolytes nature and operating conditions. The Ni content of deposits increased with increase in Ni bath concentration, temperature, pH and solution agitation but decreased considerably with increase in current density. The throwing power of the Zn-Ni solution deteriorated as Ni metal bath concentration increased. The Co content of deposits also increased with increase in Co bath concentration and temperature, and decreased with increase in current density. However, the addition of commercial organic additives to Zn-Co plating solutions suppressed considerably the amount of Co in the coatings. The Co content of <b>deposits</b> <b>plated</b> from Zincrolyte solution was found to be more sensitive to variation in current density than in the case of <b>deposits</b> <b>plated</b> from the alkaline Canning solution. The chromating procedures were carried out using laboratory formulated solution and commercially available ones. The deposit surface state was of great significance in influencing the formulation of conversion coatings. Bright and smooth deposits acquired an iridescent colour when treated with the laboratory formulated solution. However, the dull deposits acquired a brownish appearance. The correlation between the electrochemical test results and the neutral salt spray in marine environment was good. Non-chromated Zn-Ni coatings containing about 11 - 14 % Ni increased in corrosion resistance compared to pure Zn. Non-chromated Zn-Co deposits of composition 4 - 8 % were required to show a significant improvement in corrosion resistance Corrosion resistance was improved considerably by conversion coating. However, the type of conversion coating was very important. Samples treated in a laboratory solution performed badly compared to those treated in commercial solutions. Zn alloy coatings were superior to pure Zn, the Schloetter sample (13. 8 % Ni) had the lowest corrosion rate, followed by the Canning sample (1. 0 % Co) and then Zincrolyte (0. 3 % Co). Neither the chromium content of the conversion films nor the chromium state was found to have an effect on corrosion performance of the coatings...|$|R

40|$|The {{fracture}} strength of silicon carbide (SiC) <b>plate</b> <b>deposits</b> produced by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) was determined from room-temperature to 1500 C using a standard 4 -point flexural test method (ASTM Cl 161). CVD SiC materials produced by two different manufacturers are {{shown to have}} only slightly different flexural strength values, which appear to result from differences in microstructure. Although CVD deposition of SiC results in a textured grain structure, the flexural strength was shown to be independent of the CVD growth direction. The orientation of machining marks was shown {{to have the most}} significant influence on flexural strength, as expected. The {{fracture strength}} of tubular forms of SiC produced by CVD deposition directly onto a mandrel was comparable to flexural bars machined from a <b>plate</b> <b>deposit.</b> The tubular (o-ring) specimens were much smaller in volume than the flexural bars, and higher strength values are predicted based on Weibull statistical theory for the o-ring specimens. Differences in microstructure between the <b>plate</b> <b>deposits</b> and deposits made on a mandrel result in different flaw distributions and comparable strength values for the flexural bar and o-ring specimens. These results indicate that compression testing of o-rings provides a more accurate strength measurement for tubular product forms of SiC due to more representative flaw distributions...|$|R
50|$|Electroless {{nickel plating}} is an auto-catalytic {{reaction}} used to deposit a coating of nickel on a substrate.

EN techniques can also be used to manufacture composite coatings by suspending powder in the bath. Electroless nickel plating has several advantages versus electroplating. Free from flux-density and power supply issues, it provides an even deposit regardless of workpiece geometry, and with the proper pre-plate catalyst, can deposit on non-conductive surfaces.|$|R

After a brief introduction to the LHC and the CMS experiment, in the first part R 2 ̆ 6 D studies on the active material of Hadronic Endcap (HE) Calorimeter for Compact Muon Solenoid Detector Upgrade are presented. We performed radiation damage and beam test studies on several wavelength shifter materials, and found that the p-terphenyl <b>deposited</b> quartz <b>plates</b> give improved light efficiency and they are also radiation hard.
