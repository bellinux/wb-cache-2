5|$|A {{voluntary}} {{fire service}} operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> which they use {{while waiting for}} assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.|$|E
5|$|Police, who {{normally}} {{are not known}} to carry fire extinguishers on duty, appeared to have used almost 25 pieces of <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> on hand {{on the day of}} the self-immolations. The nearest building is 10 minutes away and footage shows that only two police vehicles were at the scene. The flames were put out in less than a minute's time.|$|E
5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSafety {{problems}} are serious in urban underground space. Take traffic and commercial entertainment underground space in Beijing as examples, the paper studies traffic accidents and fire disaster in Xizhimen subway station, Zhongyou and Juntai department store, and finds in Xizhimen subway station the crowd speed are 0. 7 m/s at {{early and late}} peak on Monday and Friday, and 0. 8 m/s at early peak on Saturday, and others is 0. 9 m/s; the population flow are about 6. 4 people/s at early peak and 4. 5 at late peak on Monday and Friday, which are larger than on Saturday (4. 8, 3. 4); the crowd density are about 3. 0 people/m 2 at early peak and 1. 9 at late peak on Monday and Friday, which are larger than on Saturday (1. 9, 1. 3); the ratio of grabbing {{up and down the}} train are 3. 19 % and 2. 01 % at late peak on Monday and Friday respectively. Traffic accidents are trample disaster, fall into orbit, and up and down the door strongly. This paper also finds the layout of security export marks and <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipments</b> are unreasonable, and mechanical and electrical failure or load irregularly are exist in Zhongyou and Juntai department store, and there would happen trample disaster, drop, and collision. According to these findings, increasing the number of trains, staff and the radio notice frequency should be taken, which would reduce traffic accidents in the traffic space; Setting safety export (escape) arrow marks and fire distinguisher reasonably and ensuring its numbers, using public fire extinguisher boxes and fire extinguishers, repairing and maintaining mechanical and electrical facilities regularly, and riding with civility should be taken to decrease accidents in commercial entertainment underground space, which are of certain significances to decrease and prevent safety problems in crowded underground space...|$|R
50|$|In 1963, facing strong {{competition}} from other bus manufacturing companies in Greece, it ventured into fire-fighting vehicle manufacture mainly on International Harvester chassis (chassis assembled by Tangalakis from SKD kits). In 1965 Tangalakis family, Alexandros Ginis, Fanourios Gyrtatos & Antonis Kalogeropoulos created TEMAX, a new company entirely focused on fire-fighting and other specialty vehicle production, which operates successfully to date. Another branch of the original company, though, has continued business under the Tangalakis name, as importers and distributors of <b>fire-fighting</b> and rescue <b>equipment,</b> vehicle parts etc.|$|R
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
25|$|Funds for <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> may {{be raised}} by the firefighters themselves, {{especially}} in the case of volunteer organizations. Events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the US. Social events are also used to raise money, including dances, community fairs and car washes.|$|E
25|$|Beriev {{developed}} unique <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> for the Be-200, {{allowing it}} to scoop water while skimming the water surface at 90-95% of takeoff speed. This system was developed using a specially modified Be-12P, coded '12 Yellow'. After installation of the fire-fighting system, the aircraft was registered RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was used to develop both the fire-fighting system and methods of operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{exceptional}} exhibitions {{are devoted}} to fire-fighting and the city waterworks. The former was prepared in the Spring 2004 {{on the occasion of}} 140th anniversary of the Bielsko-Biała Volunteer Fire Department. The Museum presents its own collection as well as souvenirs belonging to local headquarters of the National Fire Service, to Volunteer Fire Department from different city districts, as well as to private individuals. The largest exhibits are two horse-drawn carriages and the interwar sleighs equipped with fire hoses. In two showcases there are archival photographs (originals and replicas) showing fire stations in Bielsko and Biała, portraits of fire chiefs, a group of fire-fighters, emblems and badges, documents etc. Next, there are souvenirs connected with fire stations in Komorowice, Bystra, Lipnik, Leszczyny, Hałcnów and Straconka. The Exhibition is completed by OSP (Volunteer Fire Department) units’ banners, <b>fire-fighting</b> and life-saving <b>equipment,</b> a collection of nozzles, helmets and belts.|$|R
40|$|The main {{threat from}} ship {{accidents}} {{is connected to}} the transport of chemical/petrochemical products and possible environmental impact from leakages. However, in case of sensitive environmental targets, a serious threat can be represented by cruise ship too, as demonstrated by Costa Concordia, a perfect example of a modern cruise ship that capsized in 2012, under calm sea and clear visibility conditions near the shore of Giglio Isle, Italy. This paper approaches cruise risk assessment in a vulnerable area located about 25 km East of Genoa with 13 km of coastline into the Ligurian gulf. The framework allows the attainment of cautious values of the maximum affected and hazardous areas, in connection with fire scenarios and smoke spreading. The conservative results are to be considered in setting-up emergency planning with appropriate response <b>equipment,</b> <b>fire-fighting</b> and lightering resources and can be a powerful tool to design optimal ship route and temporary docking points for cruise tourism, thereby balancing economic issues and inherent safety criteria...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} comprehensive introduction to world jet transport safety and aviation fire safety. Divided into six sections, this thesis contains: 1) a statistical review of overall levels of safety and risk assessment in world jet transportation, 2) a statistical breakdown of jet accidents occurring between 1970 and 1992 by accident type and cause, 3) a case review of major jet accidents involving fire, 4) a review of fire prevention and fire hardening measures in jet transport aircraft, 5) a review of fire management practices in world jet transport aviation, and 6) a comprehensive chronological summary of all world jet transport accidents occurring between 1970 and 1992. Special emphasis is placed on fire safety, as statistics have shown that both in-flight and post-crash fires are among least survivable of all accident causes and are leaders in total fatalities. Included is an exhaustive review of aviation <b>fire-fighting</b> agents and <b>equipment,</b> as well as design parameters and equipment used for the fire hardening of jet aircraft. Finally, an economic analysis is included to illustrate the economic impact of fire safety measures. Cover titleMay 1995 Also issued as an M.

25|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore hydrants. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.|$|E
25|$|The first {{documented}} operational {{use of the}} Be-200 {{was from}} 20 August till 30 September 2004. For this period a Be-200ES was operated from Sardinia (Italy) by SOREM, the official operator of <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> of Italian Civil Defense Department (Protezione Civile). The aircraft, flown by joint Russian-Italian flight crew performed more than 100 flights with about 90 hours flown. During seven hours of operational flights, the aircraft participated in the extinguishing of four forest fires and dropped 324 tons of water.|$|E

5000|$|Fire-fighting, {{rescue and}} other {{emergency}} services are {{undertaken by the}} three operational commands － Hong Kong (including marine and off-shore islands), Kowloon and the New Territories. There are 81 fire stations across Hong Kong's 3 operational commands. In 2004, they responded to 35,092 fire calls and 20,059 special service calls. Careless handling or disposal of cigarette ends, matches and candles remained the major causes of fires, followed by incidents involving the preparation of food and electrical faults. Fires claimed nine lives and 451 injuries in 2004. Of the injured, 46 were Fire Services personnel. Special service calls cover {{a wide range of}} incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, house collapses, attempts by people to jump from a height and malfunctioning lifts. In 2004, 717 people died and 1,995 others were injured in such incidents. One of the dead and 16 of the injured were Fire Services personnel. The department has 835 operational appliances and vehicles fitted with up-to-date <b>fire-fighting</b> and rescue <b>equipment.</b> The first-line appliances, basically comprising major pumps, hydraulic platforms, light rescue units and turntable ladders/snorkels, are supported where necessary by other special appliances/equipment.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study by the}} authors using a heated thermal manikin showed that the cooling rates of phase change material (PCM) are dependent on temperature gradient, mass, and covering area. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if the cooling effects of the temperature gradient observed on a thermal manikin could be validated on human subjects in extreme heat. The subjects wore cooling vests with PCMs at two melting temperatures (24 and 28 °C) and <b>fire-fighting</b> clothing and <b>equipment,</b> thus forming three test groups (vest 24, vest 28 and control group without the vest). They walked on a treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h in a climatic chamber (air temperature = 55 °C, relative humidity = 30 %, vapour pressure = 4, 725 Pa, and air velocity = 0. 4 m/s). The results showed that the PCM vest with a lower melting temperature (24 °C) has a stronger cooling effect on the torso and mean skin temperatures than that with a higher melting temperature (28 °C). Both PCM vests mitigate peak core temperature increase during the resting recovery period. The two PCM vests tested, however, had no significant effect on the alleviation of core temperature increase during exercise in the heat. To study the possibility of effective cooling of core temperature, cooling garments with PCMs at even lower melting temperatures (e. g. 15 °C) and a larger covering area should be investigated...|$|R
500|$|The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) {{raised the}} alarm in a 2009 edition of its magazine, Cornerstone, {{in which the}} deteriorating {{condition}} of the barn was highlighted as the magazine's cover story. The magazine reported that {{on a recent visit}} [...] "more than a dozen gaps in the tiled roof were seen, some large. The site appeared to lack <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> or alarms, and could be easily accessed. Plants have taken root in the stone-and-brick plinth, and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands." [...] English Heritage issued a statement saying: [...] "The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage (and the local authority) for some years despite our offers of help, support, advice and grants. It {{should be noted that the}} Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not, according to plans we have seen, propose its demolition or removal. However, this still leaves question marks over the barn’s future and in particular, the issues of viability and setting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coventry's darkest hour {{came during}} World War II when Adolf Hitler singled out Coventry for heavy bombing raids. Large {{areas of the}} city were {{destroyed}} in a massive German bombing raid during the night of 14/15 November 1940. Firemen from throughout the Midlands came to fight the fires but found that each brigade had different connections for their hoses. [...] Consequently, much <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> could not be used.|$|E
2500|$|An intense fire erupted {{inside the}} fuselage. [...] The first <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to reach the}} site was the fire tender from the airport, crewed by one fireman only.

2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, another common fire {{extinguisher}} was a single-use, sealed glass globe known as a [...] "fire grenade," [...] filled with either carbon tetrachloride or salt water. The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire. [...] The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a solder-based restraint. [...] When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the extinguishing agent to be automatically dispersed into the fire. [...] A well-known brand was the [...] "Red Comet," [...] which was variously manufactured with other <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>equipment</b> in the Denver, Colorado area by the Red Comet Manufacturing Company from its founding in 1919 until manufacturing operations were closed in the early 1980s.|$|E
