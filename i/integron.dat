50|$|Integrons are genetic {{mechanisms}} that allow bacteria {{to adapt and}} evolve rapidly through the acquisition, stockpiling and differential expression of new genes. These genes are embedded in a specific genetic structure called gene cassette (a term that is lately changing to <b>integron</b> cassette) that generally carries one promoterless ORF together with a recombination site (attC). <b>Integron</b> cassettes are incorporated to the attI site of the <b>integron</b> platform by site-specific recombination reactions mediated by the integrase.|$|E
50|$|This {{system is}} based upon a natural site {{specific}} recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the <b>integron</b> system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the <b>integron</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Integrons are genetic {{structures}} in bacteria which express and {{are capable of}} acquiring and exchanging gene cassettes. The <b>integron</b> consists of a promoter, an attachment site, and an integrase gene that encodes a site-specific recombinase There are three classes of integrons described. The mobile units that insert into integrons are gene cassettes. For cassettes that carry a single gene without a promoter, the entire series of cassettes is transcribed from an adjacent promoter within the <b>integron.</b> The gene cassettes are speculated to be inserted and excised via a circular intermediate. This would involve recombination between short sequences found at their termini and known as 59 base elements (59-be)—which may not be 59 bases long. The 59-be are a diverse family of sequences that function as recognition sites for the site-specific integrase (enzyme responsible for integrating the gene cassette into an <b>integron)</b> that occur downstream from the gene coding sequence.|$|E

40|$|<b>Integrons</b> are {{powerful}} bacterial genetic elements that permit the expression {{and dissemination of}} antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes. They contain a promoter Pc that allows the expression of gene cassettes captured through site-specific recombination catalyzed by IntI, the integron-encoded integrase. Class 1 and 2 <b>integrons</b> are found in both clinical and environmental settings. The regulation of intI and of Pc promoters has been extensively studied in class 1 <b>integrons</b> and the regulatory role of the SOS response on intI expression has been shown. Here we investigated class 2 <b>integrons.</b> We characterized the PintI 2 promoter and showed that intI 2 expression is not regulated via the SOS response. We also showed that, unlike class 1 <b>integrons,</b> class 2 <b>integrons</b> possess {{not one but two}} active Pc promoters that are located within the attI 2 region that seem to contribute equally to gene cassette expression. Class 2 <b>integrons</b> mostly encode an inactive truncated integrase, but the rare class 2 <b>integrons</b> that encode an active integrase are associated with less efficient Pc 2 promoter variants. We propose an evolutionary model for class 2 <b>integrons</b> in which the absence of repression of the integrase gene expression led to mutations resulting in either inactive integrase or Pc variants of weaker activity, thereby reducing the potential fitness cost of these <b>integrons...</b>|$|R

50|$|A gene {{cassette}} {{is a type}} of mobile genetic element that contains a gene and a recombination site.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to detect class, II and III <b>integrons</b> using {{multiplex}} PCR, and to analyze the role that these <b>integrons</b> play in mediating multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA). The sensitivity of SA to 20 types of antibiotics was examined using the K-B method. A genomic DNA extraction kit was used for extracting genomic DNA and a high-purity 96 plasmid extraction kit was used for extracting plasmid DNA. Class, II and III <b>integrons</b> were amplified using multiplex PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used for analysing amplification products. The positive rate of class and II <b>integrons</b> in the plasmid DNA from SA was higher compared to that of the genomic DNA. The positive rate of class <b>integrons</b> was highest in the group with multidrug resis-tance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, rifampin, imipenem, cefazolin, cefuroxime, levofloxacin and gentamicin. As regards inte-gron detection in the plasmids from drug-resistant SA strians obtained from sputum, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, drainage fluid, excretion and urine specimens, the difference in the detection rate of class <b>integrons</b> among the six types of speci-mens was significant.

5000|$|DNA damage can be {{inflicted by}} {{the action of}} antibiotics, bacteriophages and UV light. Of {{potential}} clinical interest is the induction of the SOS response by antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. Bacteria require topoisomerases such as DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV for DNA replication. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin are able to prevent the action of these molecules by attaching themselves to the gyrase - DNA complex, leading to replication fork stall and the induction of the SOS response. The expression of error-prone polymerases under the SOS response increases the basal mutation rate of bacteria. While mutations are often lethal to the cell, they can also enhance survival. In the specific case of topoisomerases, some bacteria have mutated one of their amino acids so that the ciprofloxacin can only create a weak bond to the topoisomerase. This is one of the methods that bacteria use to become resistant to antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin treatment can therefore potentially lead to the generation of mutations that may render bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin. In addition, ciprofloxacin has also been shown to induce via the SOS response dissemination of virulence factors [...] and antibiotic resistance determinants, as well as the activation of <b>integron</b> integrases, potentially increasing the likelihood of acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance by bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: As an {{opportunistic}} pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii causes various nosocomial infections. In recent years, {{the increasing}} cumulative infection outbreaks involving A. baumannii have appeared worldwide. In addition, a perplexing trouble for clinical treatment is a severe drug-resistance problem with A. baumannii. In this study, we investigated the drug-resistance rates and integrons′ distribution in A. baumannii clinical strains in East China. Furthermore, we explored {{the relationship between}} <b>integrons</b> and drug resistance. Materials and Methods: Strains were identified using non-fermenting bacteria identification cards by Vitek- 32 system. Disk-diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer) was used to judge antimicrobial sensitivity. <b>Integrons</b> and the gene cassettes of <b>integrons</b> were identified by PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Results: Except imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam, the drug-resistance rates of the A. baumannii clinical isolates to other 15 kinds of antibacterials, all surpassed 30 %. Of 96 A. baumannii clinical isolates, 66 strains carried class 1 <b>integrons</b> (no class 2 or 3 <b>integrons</b> were found). Overall, the drug-resistance rates in integrons-positive A. baumannii to 14 kinds of antibacterials were higher than those in integrons-negative A. baumannii. Gene sequencing showed that 9 of 12 <b>integrons</b> contained seven different gene cassettes (aacA 4, catB 3, dfrA 1, blam- 1, orfX, aadA 1, and sat 2).

The rapid spread of class 1 <b>integrons</b> in the last 60 years is partly a result of their association with a specific suite of transposition functions, which has facilitated their recruitment by plasmids and other transposons. The widespread use of antibiotics has acted as a positive selection pressure for bacteria, especially pathogens, which harbor class 1 <b>integrons</b> and their associated antibiotic resistance genes.

Methods Of the 51 isolates of K. pneumoniae selected for this study, 29 were from multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, and 22 were from children's microbiota. The susceptibility profile was determined using the disk diffusion method, and class 1 <b>integrons</b> were detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results The results showed that none of the 22 microbiota isolates carried class 1 <b>integrons.</b> Among the 29 clinical isolates, 19 (65. 5 %) contained class 1 <b>integrons,</b> and resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was identified in 18 of these isolates (94. 7 %).
