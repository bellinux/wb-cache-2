50|$|A Julian year {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the <b>Julian</b> <b>day</b> (also <b>Julian</b> <b>day</b> number or JDN), which is also used in astronomy. Despite the similarity of names, there is little connection between the two. It is a way of expressing a date as the integer number of days that have elapsed since a reference date or initial epoch. The <b>Julian</b> <b>day</b> uniquely specifies a date without reference to its day, month, or year in any particular calendar. A specific time within a day is specified via a decimal fraction.|$|R

50|$|<b>Julian</b> <b>day</b> {{number is}} {{a count of}} days elapsed since Greenwich mean noon on 1 January 4713 B.C., Julian proleptic calendar.

40|$|Study of {{developmental}} stages of forest trees {{in a long}} time series is of increasing importance for determination of interdependence between meteorological variables and the associated biological responses. In our study we analyzed the needle appearance and leaf unfolding of conifers and deciduous trees and the autumn colouring for broad-leaved tree species. We considered the phenological phases for oak (Quercus robur L.) in research plots Krakovski gozd and Murska šuma, beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in research plots Lontovž, Temenjak, Borovec, Fondek, Gorica; spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in research plots Kladje and Krucmanove Konte; Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the research plot Brdo, black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) in the research plot Gropajski bori. On average, the needle appearance (BGS) of spruce started on the 166 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day.</b> BGS of Scotch pine started on the 128 th <b>Julian</b> <b>Day,</b> BGS of black pine on the 149 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day,</b> respectively. The leaf unfolding (BGS) for beech started, on average, on the 128 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day</b> and BGS for oak on the 117 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day,</b> respectively. The autumn colouring(EGS) for beech, on average, started on the 297 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day,</b> for oak on the 308 th <b>Julian</b> <b>day.</b> It was assessed that BGS possibly commenced earlier for spruce, Scotch pine and black pine in all research plots during the 2004 to 2011 period. However, earlier BGS for beech and oak was noticed only in limited number of pots. Later EGS for beech could be confirmed in only two plots (Borovec in Gorica), whereas changes in EGS for oak were later only in plot Murska Šuma. There was a large variability of LGS for beech and oak over the years. Prolonged growing season (LGS) of beech was statistically significant for 3 plots (Fondek, Borovec in Gorica) during the 2004 to 2011 period. For oak prolonged LGS was not statistically significant during the observation period...|$|R
