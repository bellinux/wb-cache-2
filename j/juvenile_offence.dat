50|$|The main {{difference}} between the Netherlands and Sweden in terms of children in court revolves around how the Netherlands tailors its law around its <b>juvenile</b> <b>offence</b> framework, meaning that each case is directly measured against that offender’s individual circumstances.

Solemn cases were usually transferred to the District Courts or the Court of First Instance. The maximum sentence in the Magistracy is two years' imprisonment and a mulct of $100,000.

40|$|Despite a {{considerable}} {{body of evidence}} detailing the overwhelming "maleness" of traffic offence behaviour and clear sex differences in the risky road use behaviour of young drivers, traffic psychology has paid scant attention {{to the issue of}} gender and the relationship between young men, cars and gender identity. Motor vehicle theft is a major <b>juvenile</b> <b>offence</b> both nationally and internationally and a particular example of a male dominated road use behaviour. Statistics suggest vehicle theft is primarily conducted by 16 year old males and is associated with approximately 40 fatalities per year nationally. This paper reports on two studies examining vehicle theft offenders, driving and gender identity. Study One (N = 4, 529), a longitudinal study, examined the prevalence of vehicle theft in a representative adolescent cohort and their subsequent novice driver offence history. Results indicated that adolescent males were more likely than adolescent females to report vehicle theft. Adolescent males {{were also more likely to}} incur Drink Driving and Dangerous Driving offences as novice drivers. Study Two compared the gender identities of adolescent offenders’ (N = 122) and non-offenders (N = 155). A new scale, the Doing Masculinity Composite Scale was developed to identify the specific behaviours adolescent males perceived as necessary to "do masculinity". Overall adolescent male offenders and non-offenders were similar in the behaviours they endorsed as "doing masculinity". Importantly both groups of adolescent males endorsed having a car and being able to drive as core masculine defining behaviours. Results indicate that adolescent males who engage in vehicle theft continue their risky driving behaviour into the novice driver period. It is also suggested that cars and driving hold particular importance to young males just about to enter the driving system. It is suggested that the gendered associations between adolescent males and cars is an overlooked area in relation to licensure and road safety education...|$|E
40|$|M. A. The young offender's {{criminal}} behaviour exerts enormous {{damage to the}} social and economical aspects of the country. Exploring the identity construction of young offenders, the decisions and choices they make in breaking into strangers' houses, stealing and hijacking other people's cars, {{is the focus of}} this study. Attention will also be focused on exploring how the criminal "career" affects and is affected by their identity construction. It is also {{the purpose of this study}} to explore what could be attracting the young offender to embark on a criminal expedition, in spite of the consequences of such activities, which appear to be uninviting and uncomfortable. The study comes about as a result of the misery and 6 trauma experienced by victims of the young offender's criminal activities (Clifford, 1974). People spend a lot of money improving the security systems in their properties with the purpose of barring the offenders from entering their premises, or taking the cars away from them. This, however, does not seem to work most of the time as it has in some cases contributed to the offenders also improving their skills on how to commit crime. There is increased surveillance in department stores, insurance premiums are high and there is an increase in the cost of goods and services. It seems that as crime escalates, more young people are sent to prison. Society also feels that prison is the best option for the young offender. Others would like the death sentence to be imposed to deal with the crime problem. At the moment, prisons are overcrowded with young people, who will be released in a few years' time. The question is whether, at the time of their release will they be able to be reintegrated back to society. What kind of people are we expecting them to be when they become adults? What role will they play in the functioning of the community? Probably the community needs to be informed about what happens in prison, for there is a general assumption that prison is a rehabilitative institution. It is seen as a place where we get rid of troublemakers, who on their release have become good citizens with a brighter future. People perceive a prison as a place that rehabilitates offenders and helps reintegrate them back into society. Whether the prison pursues and achieves this purpose needs to be seen. However, the high rate of recidivism leaves much to be desired. Cronje'et al. (1976) in their study found that a large number of young offenders became recidivists or recidivism can be traced back to <b>juvenile</b> <b>offence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chapter 4 of the book, Markets, {{rights and}} power in Australian social policy, edited by Gabrielle Meagher and Susan Goodwin, and {{published}} by Sydney University Press. Social benefit bonds (SBBs), {{also referred to as}} social impact bonds (SIBs), are a very recent innovation in the fields of social policy and finance. This chapter, by Angela Mitropoulos and Dick Bryan, shows they are profoundly challenging the conventional division between states and markets, and public and private sectors, since they involve the private funding of programs that are embedded within the provision of state services. So, unlike privatisation and subcontracting, where the state cedes high levels of control to non-state providers, SBBs bring financial calculation and the pursuit of financial yield inside the state. To date, they have applied exclusively to welfare programs (specifically recidivism in the prison sector and <b>juvenile</b> <b>offence</b> in the context of foster care). For politicians preoccupied with fiscal austerity, SBBs are depicted as an instrument that creatively breaks the impasse of restricted public policy funding and passes the risk of policy initiatives outside the state. For welfare service providers strapped for cash, SBBs anticipate a significant expansion of resources, albeit with added dimensions of performance accountability and metrics. For private financial investors, these bonds are presented as alternative investment devices that promise yield and the ability to diversify risk in their portfolios. Concern about marketisation in social policy typically focuses on the need to defend collective endeavours {{under the auspices of the}} state. With SBBs, collective endeavours are re-conceived as private opportunities for hedge funds and venture capital. The advocates of SBBs, and those in the welfare sector who embrace their introduction as manna from heaven, might reflect that while new projects may come online, and some positive outcomes may be achieved, the framework of venture capital and the stamp of profitability will be setting agendas. In the process, the state itself becomes the enforcer of – not a site of alternatives, let alone resistance to – those commercial agendas.   Chapters in Markets, rights {{and power in}} Australian social policy: Introduction: Capturing marketisation in Australian social policy 1) The politics of market encroachment: policymaker rationales and voter responses 2) The marketisation of human services and the expansion of the not-for-profit sector 3) The devil 2 ̆ 7 s in the detail: the hidden costs of private retirement incomes policy 4) Social benefit bonds: financial markets inside the state 5) 2 ̆ 7 Which bank? 2 ̆ 7 Competition and community service obligations in the retail banking sector 6) Community aged care providers in a competitive environment: past, present and future 7) Home security: marketisation and the changing face of housing assistance in Australia 8) Money and markets in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare system 9) Marketisation of immigrant skills assessment in Australia 10) Markets in education: 2 ̆ 7 School choice 2 ̆ 7 and family capital 11) Conditional income transfers and choice in social services: just more conditions and more markets...|$|E
25|$|In the Kids {{for cash}} scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who {{promoted}} {{a platform of}} zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart.

40|$|How are <b>juvenile</b> <b>offences</b> {{reported}} by mass media? Most {{of the major}} newspapers in Japan {{are subject to the}} code provided by Article 61 of the Juvenile Law. Crimes committed by juveniles below the age of twenty are usually reported without their names and facial portraits. Mass media unveil their real names only when they consider the atrocities are extremely serious. Some scholars, however, who specialize in juvenile laws, insist there should be no space for such exceptional interpretation of the law as they understand the Juvenile Law aims to protect minors by making special provisions for juvenile delinquency and crime. This study also examines and compares several major reporting cases in the United States and Taiwan. It concludes that mass media may reveal autonyms of juvenile criminals over the age of eighteen based on the utmost priority on the right to know and freedom of expression. In that case Article 61 of the Juvenile Law has to be revised...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is threefold. Firstly, to understand the causes of <b>juvenile</b> <b>offences</b> so as to prevent them. Secondly, to examine the options available for young offenders when they leave custodial care or detention centres. Thirdly, to analyze in what way young offenders are represented {{in the media and}} how this might affect their possible reintegration back into society. It is hoped that these three aims will reveal how a young offender leaving a detention centre reintegrates back into society. What methods are available to help them voluntarily rehabilitate after committing a crime will be examined. For the terms of this dissertation, juvenile offenders or young offenders will be defined as those under 18 who have committed an illegal act. There may not necessarily have been prosecution because of the act so an offence may be when a youth is only referred to the Gardai because of an offence. The researcher stresses that no exact theory will be produced on the best method of young offenders reintegrating back into society...|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{reformatory}} {{schools were}} provided for criminal children whilst industrial schools {{were intended to}} prevent vulnerable children becoming criminal. There was a perceived rise in juvenile delinquency in the early 19th century; whereas in a rural economy very young children could gain paid employment doing tasks such as bird scaring and stone gathering these opportunities were not available in the cities. Youngsters were very visible on the streets. In 1816, Parliament set up a ‘Committee for Investigating the Alarming Increase in Juvenile Crime in the Metropolis’, in 1837 the writer Charles Dickens published Oliver Twist {{a story about a}} child involved in a street gang. and in 1847 it was recognised in the <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Offences</b> Act of 1847, that children under 14 should be tried in a special court not an adult court. Begging and vagrancy was rife, and it was these low level misdemeanours that caused the magistrates to send vulnerable youngsters to industrial schools to learn to be industrious, and learn skills that would make then more employable.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{significant}} inflection in risk taking and criminal behavior during adolescence, but the basis for this increase remains largely unknown. An increased sensitivity to rewards has been suggested to explain these behaviors, yet <b>juvenile</b> <b>offences</b> often occur in emotionally charged situations of negative valence. How behavior is altered by changes in negative emotional processes during adolescence has received less attention than changes in positive emotional processes. The current study uses a measure of impulsivity in combination with cues that signal threat or safety to assess developmental changes in emotional responses to threat cues. We show that adolescents, especially males, impulsively react to threat cues relative to neutral ones more than adults or children, even when instructed not to respond. This adolescent-specific behavioral pattern is paralleled by enhanced activity in limbic cortical regions implicated in the detection and assignment of emotional value to inputs and in the subsequent regulation of responses to them when successfully suppressing impulsive responses to threat cues. In contrast, prefrontal control regions implicated in detecting and resolving competing responses show an adolescent-emergent pattern (i. e. greater activity in adolescents and adults relative to children) during successful suppression of a response regardless of emotion. Our findings suggest that adolescence {{is a period of}} heightened sensitivity to social and emotional cues that results in diminished regulation of behavior in their presence...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{is considered to}} be a key element in the prevention of recidivism among juvenile sex offenders (JSOs), often by imposing long-term consequences based on that assessment. The authors reviewed the literature on the predictive accuracy of six well-known risk assessment instruments used to appraise risk among JSOs: the Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol-II (J-SOAP-II), <b>Juvenile</b> Sexual <b>Offence</b> Recidivism Risk Assessment Tool-II (J-SORRAT-II), Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual <b>Offence</b> Recidivism (ERASOR), <b>Juvenile</b> Risk Assessment Scale (JRAS), Structured Assessment of Violent Risk in Youth (SAVRY), and Hare Psychopathy Checklist:Youth Version (PCL:YV). Through a systematic search, 19 studies were reviewed. Studies showed differences in the predictive accuracies for general, violent, and sexual recidivism, and none of the instruments showed unequivocal positive results in predicting future offending. Not unexpectedly, the accuracy of the SAVRY and PCL:YV appeared to be weaker for sexual recidivism compared with specialized tools such as the J-SOAP-II or the ERASOR. Because of the rapid development of juveniles, it is questionable to impose long-term restrictions based on a risk assessment only. New challenges in improving risk assessment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Youth Violence: The Discovery of a Social Problem Youth {{crime in}} Swedish editorials 1950 - 1994   This article offers an {{analysis}} of how juvenile delinquency has been treated in editorials in Swedish newspapers between 1950 - 1994. It shows that the focus has shifted from property offences to violence. The shift is discussed from two perspectives; the objectivist and the constructionist. It is argued that the diminishing interest of the press in <b>juvenile</b> property <b>offences</b> {{since the beginning of}} the 1970 ´s corresponds to the pattern of recorded crime trends. From 1986 onwards, however, youth violence became a major topic in Sweden. Yet this cannot easily be explained by the objectivist approach alone. The constructionist approach seems to be a useful complement. The paper ends with a suggestion that a re-evualation of some parts of the crime statistics is needed. The emergence of youth violence as a social problem after 1986 has probably led to a higher propensity to report such acts. Therefore, statistics that are not dependent upon public reporting should be used when analysing the development of youth violence in Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Magister Artium (Social Work) - MA(SW) The {{phenomenon}} {{juvenile delinquency}} {{is an enormous}} concern for communities in the ZFM district, Northern Cape, South Africa. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>offences</b> have increased since 2010 in this area. From existing theories, {{it is clear that}} the causes of this phenomenon are complex and interrelated. Some of these contributing factors are rooted in the character of the delinquent and his or her family. Other factors are peer, community or economic related. Against this background, it is clear that each community/area should be individually assessed concerning its contributing factors as these factors can differ from community to community, individual to individual and family to family. Thus, the research question: What are the psychosocial contributing factors of juvenile delinquency in the ZFM district, Northern Cape, South Africa? The research goal of this study was to determine the psychosocial factors contributing to juvenile delinquency in the ZFM region in the Northern Cape, South Africa. The objectives to arrive to the aim were to explore and describe the psychosocial factors contributing to juvenile delinquency in the ZFM region in the Northern Cape, South Africa and to make recommendations for interventions through probation services by probation officers and the Department of Social Development in the Northern Cape, South Africa. A qualitative approach was used, with an exploratory, descriptive design. Non- probability; purposive sampling was used to select probation officers from the Department of Social Development in the ZFM district in the Northern Cape. These Probation officers have each identified a parent of a juvenile in their caseloads. Because both parents of delinquents and probation officer’s perceptions are shaped by their own context, social constructivism was used as theoretical framework. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews with a checklist. The spiral for data analysis was used to analyse data, which was then clustered in themes, sub- themes and categories. Probation officers, participants identified a range of familial and community contributing factors to juvenile delinquency, and emphasises the interplay between these factors. Their also stressed the issue of parental control and guidance. Participants further indicated that harsh and ineffective parental discipline, lack of parental involvement, family conflict, child abuse and/or neglect and rejection by parents have also been identified as important factors related to delinquent behaviour. Another finding was that single parents, especially single mothers and the lack of a father figure are a great risk factor for juvenile delinquency. Parents also stressed the issue of their lack of control due to peer dependence and the juvenile’s involvement in alcohol and drugs. Probation officers also stressed the lack of parental involvement, continuous communication & parental guidance as some of the important contributing factors of delinquent behaviour amongst children. Parents also indicated a general lack of close relationship amongst family members, as well as emotional insecurity, and the inability to control their children. Both parents and probation officers agreed that peer pressure is a mayor risk factor concerning juvenile delinquency...|$|R

The present investigation aimed to replicate and extend current research of case linkage, a method that uses across-crime offender behavioural similarity to predict whether crimes belong to a common offender (Woodhams, Hollin, & Bull, 2007). A total of 320 solved residential burglaries were obtained, and three samples, each with 80 pairs of offences were created (linked, unlinked (dependent), unlinked (independent)). Following the method employed by previous researchers, behavioural similarity of linked pairs (committed by the same offender) was compared to unlinked (dependent) pairs (committed by different offenders). Following Woodhams‟ (2008) study of serial <b>juvenile</b> stranger sexual <b>offences,</b> this methodology was extended by also comparing similarity of linked pairs with unlinked (independent) pairs that were matched with the linked pairs on variables that {{have been shown to}} influence the characteristics of burglary offences (e. g. Rengert, 1975, as cited in Rengert, 1989; Snook, 2004). The justification for this methodology is to reduce potentially inflated dissimilarity between unlinked pairs that may have been problematic in previous research. In both analyses (linked versus unlinked (dependent), linked versus unlinked (independent)), distance between burglary locations possessed a high degree of accuracy in distinguishing linked from unlinked pairs. Comparatively, other traditional modus operandi behaviours showed less potential for linkage, in both analyses. The implications of the findings are interpreted and avenues of future research are discussed. University of Leiceste...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is mainly geared to critically analyze Community Policing of Pakistan, {{its impact on}} overall Pakistan. An attempt {{has been made to}} explore the new role model for Pakistan in this perspective and possible linkages have been explored such as Japan. Research has been divided in to seven main chapters. Community policing is a newly emerging crime preventive and community justice concept having its roots in 1960 â€™s. The idea of community policing is under process of evolutions. It is a challenge to old police and public taboos in which both were considered as enemies of one another. Community policing provides new and fresh outlook and treatment to the problems of community. The community policing strategy include involvement of citizens as well as law enforcement to alleviate poverty, clean environment, reduce drug abuse and addiction and provides no hide outs to criminals 2 within the community. This idea is primarily based upon the assumption that police and public can work together effectively to solve problems of society, especially crime. The research would open new vistas of knowledge for police managersâ€™ social scientists and community developers. Improving community police relations had always been a challenge for those who wish things in changed ways. By perceiving concepts of community policing collecting data by variety of methods and research techniques, and achieving community willingness for change, the {{research is}} geared to analyze present state of affairs in relation to police public contact, co-operation and coordination. The collaborative models that initiates police social order. The overall objectives of community policing include alleviation or poverty fear of crime, social distress and other inconveniences. The community policing by its introduction would improve overall attitudes of police and people toward one another. The police would be given highest community support in tackling incidence of crime in the society. The community would be secured by police form all threats affecting life and property of common citizens. Thus community policing would be mutually beneficial idea. Policing is a service that is objectively provided by the police to community people by denying access of criminals to civic preparation. The police work primarily focuses upon preventing crime before it harms any member of the society. The fear of crime reduced or kept low to boost community confidence of personal safety and security. Chapter one provides the overview of origin of policing which focused on the concept of policing emerging in various ways all over the world. Policing was meant to prevent and control the criminality from Societies dealing with crime and criminality. The earliest roots of policing were also traced in traditions found during the administration of justice during the Islamic Caliphate of Hazrat Umer. The public especially the poor were observed by the Caliph Umer. The problems and issues were thus understood and resolved by the caliph during the night he used to got out and enquire the matter of people in disguise this was carried out also by different caliph during the Islamic rule at that time. This whole background of thought gives a birth to policing in the modern society. Policing with a context to ancient aspect of crime prevention is discussed in the start of the chapter. The development of policing is found having roots in history and other socio-political developments. Modern policing adopted advanced techniques of dealings with crimes and criminality. The policing during Islamic regimes, along with different empires of Britain, France, Hindu rulers in India and Muslim rulers in India are explained briefly. Chapter two is mainly focusing on historical background of Pakistan. Itâ€™s policing structure, police establishment, police hierarchy, major areas in which police operates, powers of police, functions of policing, police incentives, proactive approach with the relationship of police and public, police performance, crime rates and trends. Chapter three provides the overview of research methodology. Chapter four introduces Koban Community policing working in Japan. This way of policing is briefed besides a look into background of policing and current agencies and strategies which are aimed at addressing crimes and criminality in Japan. The objectives of Koban policing are discussed. The concepts like meaning and historical development of Koban policing are also elaborated. Koban policing is presented as a model policing including its main functions, areas of work, main and side functions included. This chapter would develop a meaningful link with concepts of community policing to be emulated as lessons learned after comparison. Community policing visioned and operative in some areas of Pakistan could be improved and made more effective and service-oriented through this deep understanding. Chapter five provides detail of Demography, Cultures and Events of Gilgit Baltistan the performance of Community Policing in Pakistan, Gilgit Baltistan. It reviews population trends for past 30 years in the study area; its geographical importance; demographic details, socio-cultural aspects. Later on attempt is made to elaborate some of the features.
