5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for <b>incorrectly</b> fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed <b>incorrectly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{contestant}} who answers one of {{the first}} five questions <b>incorrectly</b> still receives a $1,000 consolation prize, contrary to what the home audience is told. This is in contrast to the old format, in which contestants who answered {{one of the}} first five questions <b>incorrectly</b> actually left with nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|A. The Football Club History Database <b>incorrectly</b> list {{this as a}} 2–2 draw. All {{other sources}} list the result as 1–1.|$|E
5|$|BBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records {{each year}} (when {{it was first}} set up, the figure was around 200 per year). Of these, {{approximately}} 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great snipe, gyrfalcon, gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic little shearwater. Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are <b>incorrectly</b> accepted, and 5% are <b>incorrectly</b> rejected.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{stressed}} serpin fold is high-energy, mutations {{can cause}} them to <b>incorrectly</b> change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or latent) before they have correctly performed their inhibitory role.|$|E
5|$|Theodore Newman Kaufman (February 22, 1910 – April 1, 1986), {{sometimes}} given <b>incorrectly</b> as Theodore Nathan Kaufmann, was an American Jewish {{businessman and}} writer {{known for his}} eliminationist views on Germans.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a natural}} hot spring that spouts water {{constantly}} without stopping for recharge. Some of these are <b>incorrectly</b> called geysers, {{but because they are}} not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.|$|E
5|$|This is {{complicated}} by the fact that in some database interface programs (or even database implementations like Oracle's), NULL is reported as an empty string, and empty strings may be <b>incorrectly</b> stored as NULL.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{received}} international notoriety in 1961 when {{he broke}} the story of novelist Ernest Hemingway's suicide in Idaho, which had initially been <b>incorrectly</b> reported by Hemingway's wife as an accidental shooting.|$|E
5|$|While some {{agree on}} the number of genera, fewer {{agree on the}} number of species. Historically, up to 80 {{different}} taxa have been described by different researchers; most of these were <b>incorrectly</b> identified juvenile birds.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently <b>incorrectly</b> ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been <b>incorrectly</b> identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{recognized}} as such {{at the time}} of its discovery, Compsognathus is the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest known non-avialan dinosaur; earlier it had been <b>incorrectly</b> thought to be the closest relative of Archaeopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Bentworth {{was awarded}} a gold postbox in 2012 after Peter Charles, a {{resident}} of the village, won a gold medal in the equestrian event of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

It flowered in November in the United Kingdom, and was grown in a greenhouse over winter.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1843 Staunton {{prevailed in}} {{a long series of}} games against John Cochrane, a strong player and chess theoretician. Chessmetrics treats these games <b>incorrectly</b> as one match when it was in fact a series of matches, and lists it as Staunton's best performance.|$|E
5|$|Every Sunday (sometimes <b>incorrectly</b> {{listed as}} Every Sunday Afternoon or Opera vs. Jazz) is a 1936 American short musical film. It {{tells the story}} of two young girls and their efforts to save a public concert series, which was being {{threatened}} by poor attendance.|$|E
5|$|Fire service {{operated}} ambulances may {{display the}} Cross of St. Florian (often <b>incorrectly</b> called a Maltese cross) as this cross is frequently {{used as a}} fire department logo (St. Florian being {{the patron saint of}} firefighters).|$|E
5|$|His {{death is}} now {{believed}} to have occurred after the first American combat fatalities in the Battle of Osan. Since the identities of other soldiers killed before Shadrick remain unknown, he is still often <b>incorrectly</b> cited as the first U.S. soldier killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|Improper {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing diplomatic incidents. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the four small stars <b>incorrectly</b> angled in the same direction, inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Stiller {{appeared}} as a celebrity contestant on the television million dollar game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He won $32,000 for his charity Project ALS after <b>incorrectly</b> answering his $250,000 in attempt to equal Edie Falco's $250,000 win.|$|E

None of the three players responded <b>incorrectly</b> to a clue.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{strength}} {{was to create}} a set of corresponding notes that allow readers to identify the meaning behind many of Shakespeare's more complicated passages or ones that may have been transcribed <b>incorrectly</b> over time. Included within the notes are occasional attacks upon the rival editors of Shakespeare's works and their editions.|$|E
5|$|Musberger's call, {{dramatic}} as it was, <b>incorrectly</b> implied that Bernie Williams fielded the double in left. Bernie was playing center {{field at the}} time. Gerald Williams was in left field playing the ball and making the late throw back to the infield.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2012, a {{controlled}} blast at 72nd Street caused rocks {{to fly over}} the station site. Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue Subway station at 72nd Street was done <b>incorrectly,</b> causing a large explosion that sent debris {{into the air and}} broke windows of buildings in the area and damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{problems}} remain: ?Oryzomys pliocaenicus, a Miocene fossil from Kansas, is of uncertain identity but may {{belong in}} Bensonomys, and fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and Pliocene of New Mexico {{have also been}} ascribed to Oryzomys, but probably <b>incorrectly.</b> A possible Oryzomys has been recorded from the Irvingtonian (Pleistocene) of Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common name}} of the {{turquoise}} parrot has varied between chestnut-shouldered parakeet, chestnut-shouldered grass-parakeet, chestnut-shouldered grass-parrot, chestnut-winged grass-parakeet, chestnut-winged grass-parrot, and turquoisine grass parrot, this last name commonly used in aviculture. The name red-shouldered parakeet was <b>incorrectly</b> applied to this species, as it was an alternative name for the paradise parrot.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so <b>incorrectly</b> believed any deception {{would have to be}} highly realistic to appear genuine.|$|E
5|$|The breathings (rough {{and smooth}} breathing) and accents (see e.g. Greek diacritics) are given fully and usually correctly. The breathings are {{indicated}} by sigla ⊢ and ⊣, {{often used in}} codices from the 9th and 10th century. In some cases breathings are given <b>incorrectly</b> (e.g. Matthew 9,7.16).|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Andy doing an interview, {{still trying to}} recall the product name from the jingle. On the basis {{that it has to}} rhyme, he <b>incorrectly</b> concludes that it {{promotes}} Fancy Feast cat food.|$|E

Homes not damaged in that flood were <b>incorrectly</b> assumed to be safe from a future flood.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnet coil}} was wound <b>incorrectly,</b> a fatal flaw. To get it {{repaired}} {{by the manufacturer}} could take months. Mac made a toy model of the coil, studied it carefully for an evening, and discovered an ingenious but simple way to repair it, which he did in about a day, and defused the crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is sometimes <b>incorrectly</b> {{described as the}} signing of the Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not {{the signing of the}} document, which took place later.|$|E
5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} <b>incorrectly.</b> In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and comparatively flat trajectory, as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and usually fire indirectly.|$|E
