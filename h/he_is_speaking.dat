5|$|In Bahá'u'lláh's {{writings}} {{he writes}} in many styles including cases where he speaks {{as if he was}} instructed by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes as though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> as God directly.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Locke {{enters the}} cabin alone and meets the figure of the {{deceased}} Christian Shephard (John Terry), who claims <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> on Jacob's behalf and is accompanied by his daughter Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). Christian warns Locke that Keamy's mercenaries from the Kahana are already en route to the Island, and that the Island must be moved.|$|E
60|$|When we <b>were</b> children. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not <b>speaking</b> of the Jews only; {{for these}} Galatians to whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing were not Jews at all, {{any more than}} we <b>are.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to men simply as men. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to the Galatians as {{we have a right}} to speak to all men.|$|R

5|$|Larry's {{interactions}} with key women {{are accompanied by}} a detailed image of whomever <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> with, unlike other non-player characters. With {{the exception of the}} prostitute, each of the women shun Larry at first, but respond favorably to gifts of varying sorts. Although {{it is not possible to}} woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans {{tend to believe that}} they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking.</b> Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking.</b> Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E

500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
500|$|Bertie is in {{a crisis}} when he must declare over the {{wireless}} in 1939 Britain's declaration of World War II with Nazi Germany. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare Bertie for his wireless address to Britain and the Empire. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, the Archbishop of Canterbury, [...] Winston Churchill and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain are present to offer support. George and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, {{but by the end}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present in the palace, Logue mentions to the King that he still had difficulty enunciating 'w' and the King jokes back, [...] "I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me".|$|E

500|$|The {{motel room}} that Cranston and Beaver appear in {{was a set}} {{constructed}} by Breaking Bad production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Director Michelle MacLaren wanted a genuine [...] "rundown motel feel", but believed {{it would be too}} difficult to film in an actual motel room because it would be too small for the cast and crew to fit inside. Instead, the set was designed so that several of the walls could be removed to make space for the cameras and crew. This allowed greater flexibility in shooting and camera angles, and the walls could be placed back into position if they were needed for the background of a shot. The first shot of the episode includes Walter speaking directly into the camera, and it quickly revealed <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> into a mirror in the motel room. MacLaren filmed the shot so it would be deliberately disorienting and unclear to the viewer where Walter was until the camera movement revealed the motel room. New York magazine writer Logan Hill interpreted Walter's speaking into the mirror as a symbol for self-reflection: [...] "He stares at a mirror reflection of himself, studying his own image, wondering if the Walt other people see gives any hint of what he’s carrying inside." ...|$|E
500|$|The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are {{the first}} known {{documents}} in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the [...] "Judenevakuierung" [...] or [...] "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination. At {{one point in the}} speech, Himmler says: [...] "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of [...] "elimination" [...] (Ausschaltung) before going on to say [...] "extermination" [...] (Ausrottung). His hesitation in the middle of saying [...] "elimination" [...] can be considered as a quick mental check {{to see whether or not}} it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience. The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his Total War speech on February 18, 1943, begins to say [...] "Ausrottung des Judentums" [...] ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying [...] "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> very publicly. His resulting phrasing is [...] "Ausrott... schaltung des Judentums", which can be likened to [...] "exterm... elimination" [...] in English.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{explanation}} of the Midrash's statement (<b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> of Shir Ha-Shirim Rabba 2:20 that begins [...] "ורבנן אמרי השביען בדורו של שמד") that God adjured the Jewish people in a generation of Shmad (religious persecution Jews, or decrees against Jews): {{that even if they}} will threaten to kill them with difficult torture, they will not leave [...] nor will they change their behavior in this manner ...|$|E

September 6, 2007, Washington Post in an article [...] "Bush & Fakhravar: Fates Entwined" [...] wrote about it; [...] "George Bush isn't talking to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> to Iranian student {{dissident}} Amir Abbas Fakhravar."

2500|$|It is {{said that}} none of the {{instances}} cited falls under the domain of papal infallibility; the Pope is not considered infallible except in the rare, solemn occasions when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> ex cathedra. According to M. R. Gagnebet, though the encyclical Humanae vitae is considered by some to be a non-infallible document, [...] "the doctrinal authority of the Pope and the Bishops is not limited to infallible teaching. The duty of obedience is not restricted to definitions of faith".|$|E

2500|$|In his 2002 article [...] "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," [...] George Murphy argues {{against the}} view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct {{evidence}} of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes Phillip E. Johnson's claim that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> [...] "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as [...] "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ." [...] The basis of this theology is Isaiah 45:15, [...] "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phaedrus {{claims that}} to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> on, but rather how to {{properly}} persuade, persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest [...] "a crop of really poor quality". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion; on the other hand, [...] "As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be".|$|E
2500|$|Through the 18th century, Southerne's {{version of}} the story was more popular than Behn's, and in the 19th century, when Behn was {{considered}} too indecent to be read, the story of Oroonoko continued in the highly pathetic and touching Southerne adaptation. The killing of Imoinda, in particular, was a popular scene. It is the play's emphasis on, and adaptation to, tragedy that is partly responsible for the shift in interpretation of the novel from Tory political writing to prescient [...] "novel of compassion." [...] When Roy Porter writes of Oroonoko, [...] "the question became pressing: what should be done with noble savages? Since they shared a universal human nature, was not civilization their entitlement," [...] <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> of the way that the novel was cited by anti-slavery forces in the 1760s, not the 1690s, and Southerne's dramatic adaptation is significantly responsible for this change of focus.|$|E
