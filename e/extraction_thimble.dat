30|$|The Soxhlet {{extractor}} is {{a sophisticated}} instrument for lab work, and {{the extraction of}} resin proceeded smoothly once a heating program was properly set with reference to an instruction provided by Büchi Co. In a preliminary experiment using resin pellets, completion of resin extraction could be confirmed via weight change of the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> {{before and after the}} operation. This was due to the low hygroscopicity of the extraction thimble; a small amount of remaining resin in the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> could be confidently detected (the weight increase of the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> was 0.21  wt%, or approximately 14  mg, when the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> was dried under vacuum at 60 °C and exposed to air with 53 % relative humidity). Solvent selection was generally {{the most important factor in}} extraction experiments. We tested several commercially available solvents that had proper solvency and boiling points (bp) for the resins. The dissolution rate of resins and the heating capacity of the instrument restricted the boiling point of solvents to around 150 °C. The candidates included good solvents for polyolefins, such as o-xylene (bp 144 °C) and 2 -chlorotoluene (bp 159 °C), and also unsuitable solvents including ketones and esters, such as cyclohexanone (bp 155 °C), 2 -heptanone (bp 151 °C), 5 -methyl- 3 -heptanone (bp 157 °C), and amyl acetate (bp 148 °C). In preliminary experiments for dissolution of polyolefins in test tubes, unsuitable solvents showed longer dissolution times for resins in comparison with good solvents. The extraction time for resins using the Soxhlet extractor was as long as expected. Extraction was completed using o-xylene for 1  h and cyclohexanone for 3  hr. Though a good solvent, o-xylene, was better in terms of extraction time, we ultimately used cyclohexanone because of the recovery rate of resins from extraction solvents and its wider commercial availability among several unsuitable solvents. Good solvents, such as o-xylene, sometimes produced swelling precipitates that were inconvenient for filtration of the extraction solution. This situation was not a serious issue for polyethylene resins, but it did pose a problem for other polyolefins, such as polypropylene and poly(1 -butene). We preferred a common set of extraction conditions that would be applicable to a wide range of polyolefins. We plan to report elsewhere on the extraction experiments of polypropylene resins, including copolymers of propylene and ethylene, using good and unsuitable solvents.|$|E

Except for cornstarch and cellulose, all fillers and additives were petroleum-based chemicals. Other chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. <b>Extraction</b> <b>thimbles</b> were products of Toyo Roshi Kaisha (Advantec, No. 89 S, PTFE/quartz fiber, outer diameter of 25  mm, length of 90  mm).|$|R
30|$|To quantitatively {{understand}} {{the removal of}} fillers from composites, polyethylene composites containing graphite, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose, were used for an extraction experiment, and {{the separation of the}} components was confirmed by the amount of recovered resins from extraction solutions and remaining fillers on the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimbles.</b> Recovery rates for resins from six composites (Entry 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10) ranged from 73.6 % to 75.2 %, and the recovery rates for the remaining fillers ranged from 23.9 % to 25.5 % (Recovery rates used in this paper were calculated based on the total sample weight of the composites. The theoretical maximum recovery rates of resin and filler in this paper are 75 % and 25 %, respectively). These results were almost equivalent to the component percentage of the composites, and could satisfy our protocol when handling loss of fine precipitates and uneven quality of the composites are taken into account. In the case of the composites containing solvent-soluble additives (DBDPE, Entry 4 and Entry 10), the recovery rate of resins (Entry 4, 73.7 % and Entry 8, 75.2 %, respectively) were the same as the composites containing graphite or calcium carbonate, although the recovery rates of the additives were apparently null. This indicates that the additives that dissolved at elevated temperatures still remained in the extraction solution at room temperature and were not incorporated into the resin precipitates. From the composites containing starch or cellulose, additives, which may intentionally be added in order to raise the apparent biobased carbon content of plastic products, polyethylene resins were successfully isolated at the theoretical recovery rates (Entry 9, 74.9 % and Entry 10, 74.6 %).|$|R
30|$|A Soxhlet {{extractor}} (Büchi Co. B- 811) {{was used}} as supplied by the manufacturer. However, to shorten dissolution time of polymers, a stirrer bar (15  mm long) was inserted into an <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble.</b> The bar was linked with a motor using a stainless steal wire through a small hole in the cooling tower of the instrument. A glass tube that supplied hot vapor from the solvent reservoir at the bottom to an extraction chamber was wrapped with a film heater to facilitate hot vapor supply. Nitrogen gas was continuously added into the instrument chamber to avoid oxidation of resins.|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} of extraction and isolation of polyethylene resins from the composites {{was carried out}} as follows. A sample of 500  mg of a composite sheet (in small pieces of approximately 3  mm square) {{was placed in a}}n <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble,</b> and 125  mL of a solvent was placed in a solvent reservoir. The instrument was operated under Soxhlet Warm mode, which {{is the same as the}} standard operation of the traditional Soxhlet extractor except for heating the extraction chamber to facilitate extraction. Extraction was carried out for 3  h under a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid oxidation of components, and stirring was used at a rotation rate of 100  rpm in an <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> to facilitate solubilization of the resins. Polyethylene precipitates formed in 30  min as the extractions cooled. Formation of precipitate from solution was rapid (in one min if the solution was cooled with running water). As a precaution solutions were allowed to stand for 3  hours, and the precipitates were subsequently recovered by filtration using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter (Millipore Co., pore size: 0.45  μm). The precipitates were rinsed with the solvent for extraction, then with a volatile solvent (ethanol). The samples for scanning electron microscope observation, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis were dried under vacuum for 24  hr without heating to avoid altering the surface morphology and the crystallinity of the samples. For other purposes (weighing of resin recovery, UV-visible, AMS measurements, and ICP analysis) drying was conducted at 60 °C to shorten the drying time.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} which contaminants were present in washed and dried shredded poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, flake) obtained from curbside collection and whether the concentrations were above the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb. Thirty-two semi-volatile contaminants were extracted from the treated flake by Soxhlet extraction using dichloromethane as a PET swelling solvent and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for identification and quantification. Soxhlet extraction of flake ground to 0 - 300 &# 956;m was effectively completed in 24 h, whereas sonication reduced the extraction time to 3 h. In contrast, Soxhlet extractions of flake ground to a larger particle size range (300 - 425 &# 956;m) were completed in 4 h, possibly due to less aggregation in the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble.</b> The levels of 26 contaminants were below 215 ppb, but six were not. Dodecanoic acid was present at about 1200 ppb, 2 -butoxyethanol was approximately 1000 ppb, limonene, benzophenone and methyl salicylate were above 800 ppb, and 2 -methylnaphthalene near 215 ppb...|$|E
30|$|The {{precipitates}} {{obtained from}} the Soxhlet extractor using 500  mg of composite containing calcium carbonate or Gofun were moistened in 25  mL of acetone followed by 25  mL of 1 % nitric acid. The mixture was agitated in a glass vessel using an ultrasonic bath for 3  hr. After the resin powder was filtered out, acetone in the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting solution was diluted to 100  mL with 1 % nitric acid and analyzed using an analytical instrument for radiofrequency inductively coupled plasma (ULTIMA 2, HORIBA Ltd., the former Jobin Yvon S.A.S.). An amount of 500  mg of calcium carbonate or oyster shell (Gofun) powder was placed in an <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> and treated with the common extraction operation. The extraction solvent in the reservoir was removed under reduced pressure until dry. The residue was added to 25  mL of 1 % nitric acid and 25  mL of chloroform, and was shaken using a separable funnel to remove hydrophobic impurities derived from the extraction solvent. After the remaining chloroform, which was dissolved in the aqueous layer, was removed under reduced pressure, the aqueous solution was diluted with 1 % nitric acid to 100  mL volume and analyzed using the ICP instrument.|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} for polyethylene isolation by a Soxhlet extractor {{in this study}} was based on a simple principle: difference in solubility behavior for each component in the composites. That is, polyethylene is soluble in a hydrophobic solvent at an elevated temperature and near insoluble at room temperature (Brandrup and Immergut 1966; Barton 1975). After cooling the extraction solution, resin components should form a dense precipitate and be successfully recovered by filtration of the entire extraction solution. Fillers such as graphite, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose are insoluble in hydrophobic solvents and remain in an <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble</b> throughout the operation. Organic additives such as antioxidants, UV-absorbents, and flame-retardants, which are mostly low molecular weight substances, have good solubility in organic solvents even at room temperature (Bolgar et al. 2008; Tolinski 2009). Various hydrophobic chemicals are known as good solvents for polyethylene at elevated temperature: hydrocarbons such as xylene and dodecane, and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. However, in this study we used cyclohexanone, which is typically not a good solvent for polyolefins due to a polar carbonyl function on the molecule, to improve resin recovery from the extraction solution. By cooling the solution to room temperature, polyethylene can form a precipitate, whereas hydrophobic organic additives remain in the extraction solution. Filtering the floating polyethylene precipitate and rinsing with a volatile solvent can yield a good sample with purity suitable for AMS measurement, and at the same time, can provide an estimate of the amount of resin content of composites.|$|E
40|$|Background: Exposure to fungi {{is often}} {{assessed}} by culturing floor dust or air samples. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate the relationships between dustborne and airborne fungi and to identify factors that modify these relationships. Methods: From November 1994 to September 1996 sequential duplicate 45 -l air samples were collected in bedrooms of 496 homes in the Boston area, using a Burkard culture plate sampler. After air sampling, bedroom floors were sampled with a vacuum cleaner that was modified to collect dust in a cellulose <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble.</b> Dust was sieved, and the fine dust was dilution-plated onto DG- 18 media. Results: Concentrations of total culturable fungi per gram of bedroom-floor dust were correlated weakly, but significantly, with those of indoor air (r = 0. 13, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Concentrations of some individual taxa in the dust and indoor air were also weakly associated. Adjusting for the concentrations of fungi in outdoor air, dustborne fungal concentrations were positively associated with those in indoor air for the taxa Cladosporium and Penicillium, but not for total fungi. The indoor air fungal levels were often predicted by different covariates to those predicting fungal levels in dust. The type of housing (house or apartment) {{and the presence of}} carpeting were often predictive factors for dust fungi. In contrast, outdoor fungal levels were often predictive of the indoor air fungal levels. Conclusions: Because our data do not indicate a strong overall relationship between culturable fungi in dust and indoor air, the results from these two methods (dust and air sampling) likely represent different types of potential fungal exposures to residents. It may be essential to collect both air and dust samples, as well as information on housing characteristics, as indicators for fungal exposure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{feasibility}} of recovering gold preloaded onto activated carbon by {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (sc-CO 2) was investigated {{in view of the}} actuality of a more environmentally friendly process for the retrieval of gold from real-world matrices (ion-exchange resin, cellulose, activated carbon) than the harsh elution methods currently employed. Several complexes of gold(I) and gold(III) were synthesised and characterised (AA, uv/visible), and their solubility in sc-CO 2 investigated, to identify a suitable compound for loading onto activated carbon and subsequent retrieval by sc-CO 2. KAu(CN) 2 was successfully loaded onto activated carbon. The mass percentage of gold relative to that of other elements on the carbon surface was monitored (SEM-EDS) before and after exposure to sc-CO 2 using a laboratory-size supercritical extractor of the latest design. A decrease in ca. 3. 6 % in the mass percentage of gold on the carbon surface, and the presence of gold in the resulting extracts (ICP-MS), confirmed that a small amount (< 1 %) of the loaded gold could be recovered. Since the same results were obtained regardless of whether sc- CO 2 extraction was performed in static mode (to establish equilibrium conditions for solubility measurement) or dynamic mode (to warrant exhaustive extraction), it could be concluded that the limiting factor was not the solubility of the adsorbate in the fluid but the amount of removable gold in the outer layer(s) of the adsorbed material {{on the surface of the}} activated carbon. The extent of gold recovery was improved to ca. 10 % of the loaded gold by entraining sc-CO 2 with tributyl phosphate (TBP) or TBP-HNO 3 (a Lewis-acid- Lewis-base-adduct supposed to improve recovery by oxidising gold(I) to gold(III) species), but the results revealed, just as with pure sc-CO 2, that there was a surface related limitation and not a TBP related limitation to the amount of recoverable gold. This conclusion could be substantiated by enlarging the surface either by larger samples of loaded carbon or by crushing samples of loaded carbon to very small particles, and in both cases correspondingly higher recoveries were obtained. The influence of different variables on the recovery of KAu(CN) 2 from activated carbon by TBP-HNO 3 entrained sc-CO 2 was studied by surface response analysis based on a statistical design. The independence of density and thus solvent strength suggested that sc-CO 2 was not the primary extractant, and a comparison between gold recovery in the absence and presence of sc-CO 2 revealed that the supercritical fluid neither improved nor deteriorated the extent of recovery by TBP-HNO 3. The slight positive effect of temperature allowed a small positive enthalpy of recovery to be calculated which could be interpreted in terms of physical desorption of gold from the carbon surface. The recoverable gold probably resided in the outer or secondary layer(s) attached to the primary monolayer on the carbon surface from where it could be desorbed by ion-dipole interaction between opposite charges (Au(CN) 2 - and positive end of polar TBP), explaining why the process was found to be surface-limited. The pore size distribution of the activated carbon was determined (mercury porosimetry) to find an explanation why gold was removed only from the surface. Although the activated carbon consisted for 95 % of micropores (8 - 100 A), the molecular diameter of Au(CN) 2. pTBP was found to be ca. 20 A so that it could easily exit a micropore and thereby warranted that, in principle, gold could be removed from the inner pore structure as well. In the course of investigating the central hypothesis, valuable additions to existing knowledge were achieved. The spectral data acquired for a few gold complexes either confirmed existing literature data or represent new data published for the first time. The uv-visible spectra of the complexes were not only recorded but also interpreted in terms of different types of transitions (d-d, charge-transfer, ∏* < [...] ∏, ∏* < [...] n). The solubility in sc-CO 2 of an organophosphorous compound (TBP) was determined with the available supercritical extractor using a self-invented procedure which prevented liquid samples from being swept away instantaneously by sc-CO 2 on entering the <b>extraction</b> <b>thimble.</b> The solubility so obtained was inexcellent agreement with values reported in the literature for similar type compounds at comparable conditions. The proved solubility of 1. 10 - phenanthroline in sc-CO 2 opened up the possibility of purifying a phenanthroline complex of gold(III) containing some unreacted ligand as an impurity by sc-CO 2 instead of recrystallising the substance from solution. The investigation drew the attention to the decisive role played by activated carbon in limiting the recovery of gold regardless of which extractant (sc-CO 2, TBP or TBP-HNO 3) was used. This encourages investigation of alternative matrices (ionexchange resins, cellulose membranes) with weaker attractive forces in future if an efficient gold recovery process need to be developed.
