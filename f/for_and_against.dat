5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>Against</b> the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E

5|$|In ice hockey, a {{combination}} of a player's goals and assists are collectively called points. Penalty minutes are the total number of minutes assigned to a player for infractions assessed during the season. Plus-minus is a statistic that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored, both <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> their team, though some in game situations will not effect the statistic.

5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: <b>For</b> <b>and</b> <b>Against</b> with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratification}} {{of this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening {{of the meaning of}} marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.|$|E
5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version {{of which is that}} actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: <b>For</b> <b>and</b> <b>Against</b> (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against</b> Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in the post-season Halla {{replaced}} Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui-Sik. Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007–2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla. As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games. He vowed to reorganize the team and {{set his sights on}} a league championship. The team's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim, then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver, as a scout for the organization. Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled 3 of the 4 spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America. Brock Radunske, Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team. They also arranged for Eric Thurston, the head coach of University of Alberta's team, to spend the first 3 weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players. Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team. In addition to the new foreigner players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon returned from military service. In the 2008 pre-season Anyang Cup, Halla finished 4th out of 5 teams. The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008–09 season to 36. In September head coach Shim was suspended for 5 games for refusal to play. The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1. Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice. The league considered the game a forfeit. Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points. Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non-Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League. Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57. Martinec finished in second place {{for the second year in}} a row in the assists category with 47. Overall the team finished with 5 players in the top 10 in the overall points tally. For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals. In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short-handed goals, ranking in the middle of the pack both in goals <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>against.</b> They were the only team not shutout during the regular season. After receiving a bye in the first round of the play-offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-final. They returned to Anyang for game 6 of the series leading 3–2. They were expected to win the series but Nippon's Ilmura scored two game-winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games.|$|E
