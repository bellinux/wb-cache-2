A calibration is started through the yield monitor installed on the harvester and the operator begins <b>harvesting</b> <b>grain.</b> Once the recommended amount of <b>grain</b> <b>harvested</b> per the manufacturer's recommendations has been <b>harvested,</b> the <b>grain</b> is offloaded into a grain holding device equipped with an accurate scale to measure the actual weight of the <b>grain</b> <b>harvested.</b> This <b>grain</b> weight is then entered back into the yield monitor and is used to adjust the calibration that relates the electrical signal of the load cell to grain mass flow.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first annually resolved temperature reconstruction for England in the Middle Ages. To effect this reconstruction the starting {{date of the}} <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> in Norfolk has been employed as a temperature proxy. Using c. 1, 000 manorial accounts from Norfolk, 616 dates indicating {{the onset of the}} <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> were extracted for the period 1256 to 1431 and a composite Norfolk series was constructed. These data were then converted into a temperature series by calibrating a newly constructed comparison series of <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> dates in Norfolk from 1768 to 1816 with the Central England Temperature series. These results were verified over the period 1818 – 1867. For the British Isles no other annually resolved proxy data are available and the onset of the <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> remains the only proxy for assessing April-July mean temperatures. In addition, this is the first time-series regarding the onset of <b>grain</b> <b>harvests</b> in medieval Europe known so far. The long-term trend in the reconstructed medieval temperature series suggests that there was a cooling in the mean April-July temperatures over the period 1256 to 1431. Average temperatures dropped from 13 °C to 12. 4 °C, which possibly indicates the onset of the Little Ice Age. The decline in values was not steady, however, and the reconstruction period contains decades of warmer spring-early summer temperatures (for example the 1320 s to the early 1330 s and the 1360 s) as well as colder conditions (for example the late 1330 s, 1340 s and the 1380 s). The decline in grain-growing-season average temperatures would not have been a major problem for medieval agriculture, rather the phases of very high interannual variability partly found in the medieval time-series, such as 1315 – 1335 and 1360 – 1375, would have proved disruptive...|$|R

40|$|High N {{fertilizer}} costs projected for the 2005 {{growing season}} provide {{an incentive for}} assigning appropriate N credits where soybean was grown in 2004. The 2004 growing season caused late soybean planting and delayed maturity for some areas resulting in low grain yields. Soybean production experiences ranged form normal <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> to abandoned acreage {{with all of the}} dry matter left in the field. In some cases immature soybean was harvested as a forage, again with all above ground dry matter removed. In other cases, soybean residue was removed for feed or bedding after <b>grain</b> <b>harvest.</b> With this variation in soybean production outcomes, questions on assigning appropriate N credits for the crops to be grown following soybean have emerged. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide soybean N credit recommendations for several of the production conditions encountered in 2004. The specific situations include the following: • Normal <b>grain</b> <b>harvest</b> with expected <b>grain</b> yields. • Soybean <b>grain</b> <b>harvest,</b> but low yields (less than 20 - 25 bu/acre). • Soybean <b>grain</b> <b>harvest,</b> residues removed. • Soybean harvested as forage with all top-growth removed. • Abandoned acreage due to immaturity or low yield, dry matter left in field. Research results from several Midwestern states (Vanotti and Bundy, 1995; Green and Blackmer, 1995; Gentry et al., 2001) indicate that the apparent N contribution of soybean to subsequent crops results primarily from the effect of soybean on net mineralization of soil N in the year after soybean is grown rather than an addition of N from the soybean residues returned to the soil. This concept is important for under-standing the effects of soybean production outcomes on the appropriate N credit for a subsequent crop. Soybean production usually results in more N being removed in the soybean grain than is fixed from the atmosphere by the soybean crop. Most of the N accumulated by soybean is stored in the grain (approximately 6 % N by weight) while relatively little N is returned to the soil in the soybean residue. Schoessow (1996) deter-mined forage and residue amounts and N contents for soybean in Wisconsin and these results are summarized in Table 1...|$|R
