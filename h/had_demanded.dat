5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers charged that Clements <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering a run for president. Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October, Molotov {{announced}} the Soviet demands in public, during a {{session of the}} Supreme Soviet. The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November.

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the Grisons as Maximilian <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial and}} {{execution}} of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange {{turned their attention to}} other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

On June 30, {{a deal to}} Edmonton was finalized, but Heatley rejected it by refusing to waive his no-trade clause. On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo, {{as well as a}} second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. Michalek would play well for the Senators, but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she <b>had</b> <b>demanded,</b> which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E
5|$|In August, Ferdinand's envoys <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> the {{transfer}} of the late John Zápolya's realm to Ferdinand in accordance with the Treaty of Várad. Peter Perényi, who had been the commander of Zápolya's troops in Upper Hungary, and Franjo Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, soon deserted to Ferdinand. The wealthy Stephen Majláth expelled most of John Sigismund's supporters from Transylvania in an attempt to seize the province for himself. Ferdinand's envoy, Hieronymus Łaski, informed Suleiman of the Treaty of Várad, asking the sultan to consent to the unification of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. Instead, the sultan stated that he supported John Sigismund and had Łaski arrested.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1914, {{following}} {{the events leading}} to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards. Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by the Germans the same day. On 3 August, the Belgian government rejected the proposal and the German invasion began. Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London <b>had</b> <b>demanded.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2013, the Nationalist {{political}} party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened {{to disrupt the}} film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film Duniyadari had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if Duniyadari was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object {{to the release of}} Chennai Express in Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, {{presented}} to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly {{defeated by the}} Senate and the claims remained unresolved. Anglophobia led by Charles Sumner was {{at an all-time high}} when Fish became Secretary of State. Sumner <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> Britain cede Canada to the United States as payment for the Alabama Claims. In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the door was open for renewed negotiations with Britain.|$|E

5|$|While bishop, de Gray often lent {{the king}} money, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} held the royal regalia as security for the repayment of a loan; he {{also served as a}} royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter and several papal legates on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King Philip II of France. Philip <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> that John's niece Eleanor of Brittany or his nephew Arthur of Brittany be surrendered to him together with all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. Philip invaded Normandy after the bishops returned to England.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> {{to remain}} neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Jon Haraldsson {{was killed}} in 1231, at Thurso in Caithness. He was contested by Snaekoll Gunnisson, a {{great-grandson}} of Rognvald Kali, who <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> that Jon should share the Earldom with him, as had been done before. Jon's supporters and Snaekoll's fought a war until {{it was agreed that}} King Haakon Sverreson should settle the matter. All concerned set off to Norway, but a ship carrying Earl Jon, his supporters, and his kin, was lost at sea on the return voyage. As a result, the line of Norse Earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 Orkney was without an Earl. In 1236 the Earldom was granted by Haakon IV of Norway, to Magnus, son of Gille Brigte, Mormaer of Angus. Although ruled by Angus, Strathearn and Sinclair lords thereafter, Orkney remained part of the kingdom of Norway.|$|E

5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E
5|$|Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 {{during the}} IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships. The two sides {{agreed on the}} terms: four games in Canada, {{to be held in}} Montreal (Montreal Forum), Toronto (Maple Leaf Gardens), Winnipeg (Winnipeg Arena), and Vancouver (Pacific Coliseum) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace. The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under {{international}} rules. The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen system in place in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Joe Kryczka, president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), who was present at the negotiations, felt however, that the Soviets <b>had</b> <b>demanded</b> the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team. The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, {{starting}} the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The Sejm voted {{to increase the}} army of the Commonwealth to 100,000men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal. The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanisław August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, the Guardians of the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On July 24, 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress <b>had</b> <b>demanded.</b> The Polish Army disintegrated.|$|E
