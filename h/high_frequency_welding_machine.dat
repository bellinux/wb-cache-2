40|$|Abstract. In the recycle trend, {{this study}} used the low-melt {{polyethylene}} terephthalate fiber and the recycle wasted materials in producing nonwoven products. These two materials were combined together to form nonwoven products, which have good drain ability and high stress. Then, the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> plastic <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> was used to manufacture the geocell of three dimension nonwoven cubic structure. This study discussed the bonding strength with different bonding length and width. The {{results show that the}} uniform of the bonding area resulted from the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> plastic <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> affects the bonding strength. In low-power (tuner point to 2) bonding strength increases while the bonding time increases...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units. They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a stepdown transformer to produce the desired welding voltage or current. The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the <b>high</b> switching <b>frequency</b> requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> inverter-based <b>welding</b> <b>machines</b> are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter <b>welding</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

This proposal offered <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>welding</b> of vinyl coated seams {{as an alternative to}} stitching for Soft Top assemblies of a Four Man Crew kit.

50|$|<b>High</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>welding,</b> {{also known}} as Dielectric Sealing or Radio Frequency (R.F.) Heat Sealing is a very mature {{technology}} that {{has been around since}} the 1940s. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> electromagnetic waves in the range of Radio Frequencies can heat certain polymers up to softening the plastics for joining. Heated plastics, under pressure weld together. Heat is generated within the polymer by the rapid reorientation of some chemicals dipoles of the polymer, which means that the heating can be localized, and the process can be continuous.|$|R
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic <b>welding,</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>welding,</b> hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|R

40|$|Steel linepipes {{produced}} by <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>welding</b> {{can result in}} a low–toughness zone at the weld junction, even after a heat treatment which reaustenitises the affected region. The possible causes for low toughness are explored, including microstructure, retained austenite, inclusions and crystallographic texture. It is found that the toughness is reduced primarily by the tendency for cleavage planes of ferrite crystals to align and hence create a macroscopic plane on which cleavage can propagate easily with little resistance from grain boundaries. This mechanism suggests that an appropriate heat treatment may alter the texture sufficiently to enhance the toughness of the zone concerned...|$|R
40|$|N WESTERN EUROPE {{flexible}} structures, {{in particular}} pneumatic con-structions, are today predominatly {{made on the}} basis of PVC-coated polyester fabrics. For this purpose 4 standard types of fabric are currently available, the technical data of which are shown in Table 1. This table includes apart from the strength at room temperature, also the strength at 70 ° C. This elevated temperature was chosen because temperature measurements conducted on air-supported structures in West Germany have always given membrane temperatures below 70 °C so that 70 ° C represents an upper limit for test purposes. Which of the 4 materials will be selected depends on the loads to be expected, resulting from the design of the structure and the environmental influences to which it will be exposed. It has been found that in West Germany the most commonly used materials is type II. In addition to the materials presented here, there have, of course, been developed other materials for special structures requiring, for instance, extremely high translucence. Moreover, there are signs that in addition to the 4 standard fabrics included in Table 1, a so-called type V having a nominal strength of about 2000 N/cm may be find general acceptance. Apart from the materials, great importance must be attached to the joints. Here, too, 4 types of seams have developed, which can be used in any of the above-mentioned materials. The joints represented in Table 2 include the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> seam, the double lapped seam, the 4 -ply French seam, and the so-called combined seam, which consists of a 2 -ply flat seam which additionally been secured by <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>welding...</b>|$|R
