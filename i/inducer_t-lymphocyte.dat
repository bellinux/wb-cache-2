40|$|We have {{prepared}} a cDNA probe that detects genes that are rapidly and abundantly expressed after exposure of <b>inducer</b> <b>T-lymphocyte</b> clones to antigen or mitogen. All inducer cells tested express a characteristic set of new mRNA, and these mRNAs are not expressed after activation of other lymphocytes. This initial burst of mRNA synthesis is paralleled by synthesis and secretion {{of a family}} of polypeptides that mediate inducer cell activity, including T- and B-cell growth factors, interferon, and molecules that bind to antigen. Expression of this initial genetic program precedes mitosis and is replaced within 74 hr by a different genetic program, which may control further cell division. The action of these sequential sets of genetic programs defines two stages of the cell's differentiation and accounts for altered expression of the cell's immunological functions...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{small sample}} of {{peripheral}} venous blood, the normal range for lymphocyte subpopulations (T-cell, B-cell, T-suppressor cell, and T-helper cell) was defined in non-infected preterm and term infants. Lymphocyte subsets were identified using a variety of monoclonal antisera, and analysis was performed using a fluorescent activated cell sorter. Such methods allow an objective assessment of absolute numbers of cells per unit volume of whole blood. There {{was no significant difference in}} absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets between term and preterm appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. Infants who were small for gestational age (SGA) had a significant deficiency in absolute numbers of total T-cells, helper and <b>inducer</b> <b>T-lymphocytes,</b> and B-cells compared with both term and preterm AGA infants. All newborn infants (term and preterm; AGA and SGA) had a highly significant increase in absolute numbers of both helper and suppressor T-lymphocytes compared with normal adults...|$|R
40|$|T 3 -associated {{disulphide}} linked heterodimers (Tin) {{comprised of}} clonally unique alpha-chains of molecular weight (MW) 49, 000 - 54, 000 and beta chains of MW 43, 000 {{have been identified}} as the antigen receptors on human cytotoxic effector and <b>inducer</b> <b>T-lymphocytes.</b> Crosslinking of Ti molecules by either the appropriate nominal antigen/MHC specificity or anti-clonotypic monoclonal antibody results in clonal expansion of such cells via induction of IL- 2 receptor expression, endogenous IL- 2 release and IL- 2 -IL- 2 receptor interaction. To determine whether analogous antigen receptor molecules and autocrine growth mechanisms are utilized by suppressor T-cells, we produced an anti-clonotypic monoclonal antibody against a non-cytotoxic T 8 + suppressor T-cell, T 8 AC 6, which defines a T 3 -associated disulphide-linked heterodimer of similar molecular weight to the above clonotypes. We find that Te-Ti triggering of suppressor clones (T 8 AC 6, T 8 AC 7 or T 8 RW) does not result in IL- 2 production or T-cell proliferation and in contrast to inducer clones, also leads to a transient IL- 2 unresponsive state. We suggest that such T 3 -Ti receptor mediated autoregulation of suppressor T-cell growth is necessary in the facilitation of initial inducer T-cell activation following antigenic perturbation...|$|R
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are {{cells of}} hematopoietic origin, which constitutively express MHC class I and II, and are {{functionally}} {{the most potent}} <b>inducers</b> of <b>T-lymphocyte</b> activation and proliferation. CD 8 + T lymphocytes proliferate and acquire cytotoxic functions upon recognition of their cognate antigen {{on the surface of}} one or various dendritic cells with which they interact. However, only some DC subsets are able to present antigen to cytotoxic T cell precursors as taken up from extracellular sources. This function is termed cross-presentation (in Spanish, presentación cruzada or presentación subrogada) and requires shuttle mechanisms from phagosomes to the cytosol for antigen processing. It has been demonstrated that the differentiation of DC with these capabilities is dependent on FLT- 3 L and the transcription factor BATF 3. They express peculiar functions and differentiation markers. These cells are distinguished in mice by surface CD 8  features, while CD 141 (BDCA- 3) marks these cells in the human. These subpopulations are capable of selective internalization of necrotic cell debris by means of their CLEC 9 A lectin which is a receptor for extracellular polymerized actin. Expression of the chemokine receptor XCR 1 favours contact with CD 8 + T cells. Therapeutic vaccination with tumour antigens using DC is a strategy under development for the treatment of cancer. The use of DC subsets with more prominent capabilities for cross-presentation would mimic the natural mechanisms of immunization to induce cytolitic T lymphocytes. In vivo targeting of antigens with monoclonal antibodies against DEC- 205 or CLEC 9 A attains very robust immune responses and is a strategy undergoing clinical trials for chronic viral diseases and malignancies...|$|R
