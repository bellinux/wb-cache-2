5000|$|In 1909, Theodor Wulf {{developed}} an electrometer, {{a device to}} measure the rate of ion production inside a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>container,</b> {{and used it to}} show higher levels of radiation {{at the top of the}} Eiffel Tower than at its base. However, his paper published in Physikalische Zeitschrift was not widely accepted. In 1911, Domenico Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake, over the sea, and at a depth of 3 meters from the surface. Pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth.|$|E

50|$|Luna 2 carried 5 {{different}} {{instruments to}} conduct various tests {{while it was}} on its way to the Moon. The scintillation counters would be used to measure any ionizing radiation; the Cherenkov radiation detectors would be measuring for electromagnetic radiation caused by charged particles. “The Geiger Counter carried on Luna 2 had the primary scientific objective of determining the electron spectrum of the outer radiation belt. The instrument consisted of three STS-5 gas-discharge counters mounted on the outside of the <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>container,</b> and would be powered by a 360 V battery”. The last instrument on Luna 2 was, “a three component fluxgate magnetometer similar to that used on Luna 1 but with the dynamic range reduced by a factor of 4 to -750 to +750 gammas so that the quantization uncertainty was -12 to +12 gammas.” Together the devices were searching for lunar magnetic and radiation fields similar to the Van Allen radiation belt around earth sending information about once every minute until its last transmission which came about 55 km away from the lunar surface. Although it did prove previous measurements of the Van Allen radiation belts that were taken from Luna 1 around the Earth, it was not able to detect any type of radiation belts around the moon. Because of claims that information received from Luna 1 was fake, as soon as the scientists of Luna 2 starting receiving transmissions they sent out the intended time of impact, and the transmission and trajectory details. Even though Soviet scientists gave all this information Americans were still skeptical until Bernard Lovell was able to prove that the radio signal was coming from Luna 2 by showing the Doppler shift from its transmissions. After this no one seemed to question the validity of the Soviets.|$|E

Results The cell viability of the cultures was 98 ± 1 % and remained high after storage. Mean central thickness of non-stored limbal epithelial sheets was 23 ± 3 μm, and no substantial loss of cells was observed after storage. The non-stored epithelial sheets expressed a predominantly immature phenotype with ΔNp 63 α positivity of more than 3 % in 9 of 13 cultures. After storage, the expression of ABCG 2 and C/EBP∂ was reduced for the 7 day Quantum 286 -storage group; (P = 0. 04), and Bmi- 1 was reduced after 4 day Quantum 286 -storage; (P = 0. 02). No other markers varied significantly.

40|$|Canning as {{a method}} of food {{preservation}} has its origin in the work of Nicolas Appert (1750 - 1841) who was the first to use heat as a means of preserving food in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> Although he did not understand the principles of his method, his systematic experimentation (and generous sharing of his discoveries) laid the foundations of thermal food preservation methods. Appert initially processed his food in cork sealed glass jars and bottles in boiling water baths for periods varying from 15 minutes to two and a half hours. Storage trials were the basis of his processing methods, some foods being kept up to ten years. His products ranged from meats, soups and vegetables to fruit and even cream and evaporated milk. He recognized the value of quick clean handling of good quality raw materials. Blanching was used with some products, and he was also aware of the distinction between acid and low-acid foods in regard to their length of processing. Appert's understanding of the process was that heating eliminated the "air" which was believed to be the cause of spoilage. This belief was to persist for nearly 100 years. Appert's work in glass containers led to the development in England about 1815 - 20 of tin containers for preserved foods. Appert himself used cans in some of his later work. Some time before 1830 the autoclave was introduced (apparently by Appert) as a means of cooking canned foods under pressure.

The data presented here characterize the behavior of GaAlAs, single mode, injection laser diodes under conditions of fluid immersion and hydrostatic pres-sure. Fluid immersion affects laser operation primarily by reducing the end facet reflec-tivity and thereby raising the threshold current. Elevated hydrostatic pressure also resul-ted in increased threshold current due to pressure induced changes in the band structure of the active layer material. Spectral changes were particularly evident with pressure induced mode hopping being the most significant effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the normal}} process of {{bioethanol}} production, biomass is transported to integrated large factories for degradation to sugar, fermentation, and recovery of ethanol by distillation. Biomass nutrient loss occurs during preservation and degradation. Our {{aim was to}} develop a decentralized ethanol production system appropriate for farm or co-operative level production that uses a solid-state fermentation method for producing bio-ethanol from whole crops, provides cattle feed, and produces no wastes. The idea is to incorporate traditional silage methods with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Harvested, fresh biomass is ensiled with biomass-degrading enzymes and yeast. Multiple parallel reactions for biomass degradation and ethanol and lactic acid production are induced in solid culture in <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> at a ranch. After fermentation, ethanol is collected on site from the vapor from heated fermented products. Results The parallel reactions of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation were induced efficiently in the model fermentation system. In a laboratory-scale feasibility study of the process, 250 g of freshly harvested forage rice with 62 % moisture was treated with 0. 86 filter paper units/g dry matter (DM) of cellulase and 0. 32 U/g DM of glucoamylase. After 20 days of incubation at 28 °C, 6. 4 wt. % of ethanol in fresh matter (equivalent to 169 g/kg DM) was produced. When the 46 wt. % moisture was gathered as vapor from the fermented product, 74 % of the produced ethanol was collected. Organic cellular contents (such as the amylase and pronase degradable fractions) were decreased by 63 % and organic cell wall (fiber) content by 7 % compared to silage prepared from the same material. Conclusions We confirmed that efficient ethanol production is induced in nonsterilized whole rice plants in a laboratory-scale solid-state fermentation system. For practical use of the method, further study is needed to scale-up the fermentation volume, develop an efficient ethanol recovery method, and evaluate the fermentation residue as an actual cattle feed. </p...|$|R
