5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, {{but it has been}} grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in <b>habit,</b> <b>and</b> would benefit from regular pruning.

5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1987 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is firstly to determine whether factors other than study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes influence academic achievement and secondly whether there exists a relationship between study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes and academic achievement, {{as well as between}} the components of study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes and academic achievement. To reach this aim a literature study was undertaken which was followed by an empirical investigation. It emerged from the literature that various factors influence academic achievement (sec chapter two) and that most writers agreed that there existed a relationship between study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes and academic achievement as well as between the various components of study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes and academic achievement (see chapter three). The empirical investigation made use of the information gathered in 1980 in the Orange Free State (see chapter four). All the Afrikaans speaking pupils in the Orange Free State during 1980 were included in the research program. Different measuring instruments, of which the Survey of Study <b>Habits</b> <b>and</b> Attitudes, Form H, was the most important for this project, were used (see paragraph 4. 5) to identify a Large variety or independent variables (respectively the experimental and control variables - see paragraph 4. 6) that influence academic achievement. The dependent variable for {{this research}} was the standard ten average marks as well as marks in the !allowing subjects: Afrikaans, English, Mathematics and Science (see paragraph 4. 6. 3). The BMDP-computer program (Dixon and Brown, 1979; revised 1983) was used to process the results. The different statistical techniques are described in paragraph 4. 7. A factor analysis was carried out to group the different variables according to their correlation coefficients with the standard ten average marks (sec table 5. 1). The 67 independent variables (respectively the experimental and control variables) were grouped into different factors. The 18 factors were then used as independent variables to determine their contribution R 2 (see tables 5. 2 and 5. 3). Next the separate and collective contribution or the components or study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes (respectively the experimental variables) to R 2 in each or the dependent variables (respectively standard ten average, Afrikaans, English, Mathematics and Science) was determined (see tables 5. 4 and 5. 5). The results or this study can be submitted up as follows: (1) Apart from study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes other factors influence academic achievement. (2) Study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes contribute a statistical significant proportion or the variance in academic achievement. (3) With a few exceptions the components or study <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> attitudes do not contribute a statistical significant proportion or the variance in academic achievement. Master...|$|R
5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), {{but it can be}} readily distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his mentor Cai E (November 1916) and of his first wife, Zhu {{developed}} a severe opium habit that afflicted him until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued to support him, and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium <b>habit</b> <b>and,</b> according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected due to his being a warlord.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycles}} of insects vary but most hatch from eggs. Insect growth is {{constrained}} by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts. The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop {{through a series of}} nymphal stages. The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70cm (22–28in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.|$|E

40|$|Background &amp; Objective: Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} {{metabolic}} bone disorder and a major health concern in women. Osteoporosis affects {{the quality of life}} of women. Studying the osteoporosis related food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors can promote health promotion program planning. It seems that female teachers are the best models and educational sources for female students. This study was carried out to determine the osteoporosis related food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors among female teachers. Methods &amp; Materials: This study was a cross-sectional study in which 308 female teachers were randomly selected using stratified sampling method from the schools of the 6 th district of Tehran. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using student t-test, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test. Results: Mean score of osteoporosis related food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors was 14. 9 &plusmn; 4. 2 (out of a possible 24 maximum attainable score). Osteoporosis related food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors score was significantly higher in the teachers who had higher knowledge score, aged more than 50 years old, had worked for more than 25 years, had used educational books and booklets as the first informational source, and among the post- menopausal teachers (P&lt; 0. 03). Conclusion: According to the findings, the teachers demonstrated average level of osteoporosis related food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors, whereas their mean calcium intake was relatively adequate, but their other food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behaviors were relatively inappropriate. It seems developing and implementation of educational programs and offering educational booklets to teacher can help to promote their food <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> behavior which may be helpful in enhancing students' food habits...|$|R

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. This wave was {{responsible}} for the foundation of the majority of England's monasteries, and very few were founded after the 13th century. These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for prayers for their soul, and often, the right to be buried within the monastic church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{provided}} {{a home to}} an average of 30 to 40 canons, sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> black cloak). One of these canons, Henry Knighton, is notable for his Chronicle, which was written during his time at the abbey in the 14th century. In 1530 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey died at the abbey, whilst travelling south to face trial for treason. A few years later, in 1538, the abbey was dissolved, and was quickly demolished, with the building materials reused in various structures across Leicester, including a mansion which was built on the site. The house passed through several aristocratic families, and became known as Cavendish House after it was acquired by the 1st Earl of Devonshire, in 1613. The house was eventually looted and destroyed by fire in 1645, following the capture of Leicester during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading <b>habit,</b> <b>and</b> he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E
