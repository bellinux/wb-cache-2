40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{frequent}} Space Transportation System Shuttle missions, photography from hyperaltitudes stands to become an accessible and convenient resource for scientists and environmental managers. As satellite products (such as LANDSAT) continue to spiral in costs, {{all but the most}} affluent consumer is finding Earth imagery from space to be more and more unavailable. Therefore, the potential for Shuttle photography to serve a wide variety of users is increasing. However, despite the popularity of photos from space as public relations tools and report illustrations, little work has been performed to prove their scientific worth beyond that as basic mapping bases. It is the hypothesis of this project that <b>hand-held</b> Earth <b>photography</b> from the Space Shuttle has potentially high scientific merit and that primary data can be extracted. In effect, Shuttle photography should be considered a major remote sensing information resource...|$|R

5000|$|We {{had this}} {{television}} show, this ensemble, these incredibly talented executive producers saying {{we need a}} home and a family, and, although we weren't prepared to make a huge commitment, we chose not to let them go. — NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield Nielsen ratings for Homicide: Life on the Street had gradually declined throughout the first season, leaving the show {{at high risk of}} cancellation by the time the season concluded.

5000|$|The film {{is divided}} into seven {{different}} chapters. Each chapter begins with a different impressionistically filmed panorama title frame featuring early 1970s rock music interludes. Each of these chapters is filmed with a motionless camera, but features movement in the panorama. In the original released film, the epilogue, “Bess' Funeral,” features David Bowie’s “Life on Mars," [...] which was replaced by Elton John's [...] "Your Song" [...] on early home video releases; the more recent Criterion edition restores the Bowie song. The overall style is heavily influenced by the realist Dogme 95 movement, of which von Trier was a founding member, and its grainy images and <b>hand-held</b> <b>photography</b> give it the superficial aesthetic of a Dogme film. However, the Dogme rules demand the use of real locations, whereas many of the locations in Breaking the Waves were constructed in a studio. In addition, the film {{is set in the}} past and contains dubbed music, as well as a brief scene featuring CGI, none of which is permitted by the Dogme rules. Some saw Breaking the Waves as mainstream cinema. Others saw it as a high budget experimental film due to its elaborate chapter shots and handheld camera in a sketchy raw style that followed the actors closely. Breaking the Waves marked an important change in focus for Lars von Trier. In von Trier's early films, the protagonist is a man, typically a disillusioned idealist whose downfall is furthered by a deceitful, fatal woman. In this film, {{for the first time the}} protagonist is a woman, emotional and naive. This motif continues in his later films, except for the comedy, The Boss of It All. Breaking the Waves controversially connects religion with eroticism. The film focuses on sexual perversity and female martyrdom, issues that continue in Trier's later work. Some critics see the self-sacrificing submissive heroine as a misogynist cliche.|$|E

The ERS- 1 SAR images are augmented with other remote sensing data, including SIR-C SAR, AVHRR, ERS- 1 ATSR, and Space Shuttle <b>hand-held</b> <b>photography.</b> Analysis of these images has revealed a more dynamic mesoscale field than was previously suspected. Eddies with scales on the order of 20 - 30 km in diameter have been the most common mesoscale features evident, but the presence of oceanic fronts and internal waves, as well as atmospheric internal waves, have been documented as well. The multisensor data record will provide insight as to the underlying ocean and meterological conditions that lead to the prevalence especially of the eddies in this region...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Recent acquisition of generally high quality color prints {{for most of}} the test sites has enabled the project to make significant advances in preparing mosaics of sand desert areas under study. Computer enhancement of imagery of selected sites, where details of complex dune forms need to be determined, has been achieved with arrival of computer-compatible ERTS- 1 tapes. Further, a comparator, recently received, gives precise visual measurements of width, length, and spacing of sand bodies and so improves comparison of patterns in various test sites. Considerable additional meteorological data recently received on sand-moving winds in China, Pakistan, Libya and other areas enabled much progress to be made in developing overlays for the dune mosaics. These data show direction, speed, and frequency of winds. Other new data for use in preparing overlays used with ERTS- 1 image mosaics include ground truth on moisture control, geologic settings, and plant distribution. With the addition of visual observation data and prints from <b>hand-held</b> <b>photography</b> now being obtained by the Skylab mission, much progress in interpreting the patterns of sand seas for 17 desert sites is anticipated...|$|E
