5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>home.</b> Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T'Pol – who {{has been}} invited to accept a Starfleet {{commission}} – takes the opportunity to travel to Vulcan to visit her mother, T'Les. When Commander Tucker mentions {{that he does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> to go to, T'Pol invites him along. On Vulcan, after a tense homecoming, she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T'Pol's actions at the P'Jem sanctuary. One logical way for T'Pol to restore her mother's position is to honor her engagement to Koss, a member of an influential family. Despite Tucker's feelings, who admits to T'Les' observation that he is in love with T'Pol, she consents to marry Koss. Just before the ceremony begins, however, T'Pol quickly kisses Tucker on the cheek.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{outside the}} Judeo-Christian {{mainstream}} also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in the city.

In 1972 a relief agency resettled the first Shi'a Muslim family from Uganda. By 2004, between 20,000 and 30,000 Somali Muslims made the city their home. In 1972, Dainin Katagiri was invited from California to Minneapolis—by one account, a place he thought nobody else would want to go—where he founded a lineage which today includes three Sōtō Zen centers among the city's nearly 20 Buddhist and meditation centers. Atheists For Human Rights has its headquarters in the Shingle Creek neighborhood in a geodesic dome. Minneapolis has had a chartered local body of Ordo Templi Orientis since 1994.|$|E
5|$|The NSWRL were {{reluctant}} to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of {{that they could be}} competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> ground, like some of the other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.|$|E
