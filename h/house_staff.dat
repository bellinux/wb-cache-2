On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to <b>house</b> <b>staff</b> or storage.|$|E

40|$|The Report on the Ministerial Committee for the Review of the Provision of Student Housing at South African Universities (Higher Education and Training, 2011) has {{provided}} {{a comprehensive review of}} residences across several housing functional areas. In one of the residence management and administration recommendations it stated, “The professionalisation of <b>housing</b> <b>staff</b> is an urgent priority” (p. 141). This coupled with the report’s estimated “current residence bed shortage of approximately 195 815 beds … with a cost of overcoming this shortage over a period of ten years is estimated at R 82. 4 billion” (pp. xvii–xviii) will mean the hiring and training of hundreds of <b>housing</b> professional <b>staff</b> to meet not only the demand of the additional residence beds but the training of current <b>housing</b> <b>staff.</b> In 2010 The Association of College and University Housing Officers – International Southern Africa Chapter (ACUHO-I SAC) initiated a Student Housing Training Institute (SHTI) first held in 2011 to meet the demands for professionalising <b>housing</b> <b>staff.</b> The SHTI was organised using a competency development model first used to develop the Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I) James C.

Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told {{to come to the}} White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White <b>House</b> <b>staff</b> to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White <b>House</b> <b>Staff</b> Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E

He also served as CEO of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the new location, new touches {{were made to the}} service. If a female diner had a handbag, a small side table was placed beside her so that she did not need to place the bag on the floor. Money was not reused; change was only given in new notes and previously unused coins. The kitchen staff were expanded further to around 25, with Robert Reid as the head chef under White. The front of <b>house</b> <b>staff</b> were also expanded to six sommeliers, four Maître d'hôtels and two head waiters. In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Following White's retirement, the Oak Room {{continued}} to operate under Reid, albeit {{with a new}} menu where the prices were reduced by between a third to a half. The majority of the staff remained with Reid, with Jeff Galvin installed as the new head chef, until he left to run the restaurant L'Escargot in May 2000. MPW Criterion was wound up on 11 September 2001; by which time planning was already underway to close the Oak Room, which took place on 15 February 2002. By this time, there were 15 other kitchen staff, and a further 15 front of <b>house</b> <b>staff.</b> There was some added difficulty for calculating the redundancy packages for the staff since {{none of them had}} written contracts, and were only calculated from the period when the restaurant was owned by the MPW Criterion company; this reduced Reid's total service from nine years to four.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White <b>House</b> <b>staff</b> found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White <b>House</b> <b>staff</b> meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E

40|$|Studying {{hurricane}} preparedness {{among the}} Resident Assistants (RAs) and Residence Life Coordinators (RLCs) at Louisiana State University (LSU) {{is imperative to}} assure that the university <b>housing</b> <b>staff</b> is fully equipped when faced with an oncoming threat. This study seeks to fill a gap in research by investigating the influences of preparedness on student housing employees. A survey was developed and the measures were found to be coherent and internally reliable through the use of factor analysis. Based on theory and previous literature, a linear regression model was developed that quantified the relationship between the independent variable of preparedness and general knowledge, past experience, preparation anxiety, threat anxiety, amount of time as a housing employee, amount of time living in Baton Rouge, location of primary address, gender, ethnicity, and car access. Only general knowledge and preparation anxiety were found to influence the preparedness construct significantly (at the 5 percent level). Demographic factors did not influence hurricane preparedness levels of <b>housing</b> <b>staff</b> employees. Results suggest that the university acts as a buffer to student populations from typical vulnerabilities that the regular population experiences in disaster scenarios. This research could be applicable to other university <b>housing</b> <b>staff</b> employees who work at a university that may be frequently impacted by hurricanes...|$|R
