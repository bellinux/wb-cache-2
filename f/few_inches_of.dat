25|$|During the day, a low {{pressure}} system developed across Texas and rain gradually turned into snow {{in parts of}} Oklahoma and northern Texas giving locally a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow particularly just east of Oklahoma City. Across southern Texas, an EF1 tornado touched down near the Corpus Christi region.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.|$|E
25|$|Located in the {{northern}} Judean Hills at about 950m above sea level, Alon Shvut is cool and dry in summer. Winters are mild, with rainfall and a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow about once a year. The old and new neighborhoods are contiguous, and lie on a northwest–southeast axis along the ridge of a hill, with a gradual plain descending to its south and dramatic gullies dropping to its north. The Givat HaHish neighborhood is on {{an extension of the}} ridge which abuts a gully to the northeast of the town.|$|E

25|$|In agriculture, {{many farmers}} could use less fertilizer, and the {{reductions}} in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate {{only the top}} <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|E
25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far better than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{repeated}} wave {{of attacks}} {{carried out by}} the Italians would render irrelevant the air-raid alarm system since it would no longer be clear if the sirens were announcing the beginning or the end of an attack. Furthermore, they used delayed-fuse bombs designed to pass through the roof and then explode inside the building and a new type of bomb which exploded with a strong lateral force, so as to destroy things and persons within a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> the ground. The bombings affected all the city and the bombers didn't attempt to destroy military targets. On the night of 18 the working class districts were badly hit. The Italian bombers dropped 44 tons of bombs, and there were more than 1,000 civilians dead (Beevor: 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded; Preston: around 1,000 dead; and Thomas: 1,300 dead and 2,000 wounded).|$|E

25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
25|$|However, {{early on}} February 16, heavy snow started falling {{in those two}} cities, and the snow later {{developed}} in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4inches (10cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15°F (-10°C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout {{the rest of the}} Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.|$|E
500|$|Dorian's {{lifeboat}} was {{the smallest}} of the ship's boats and, with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board, had only a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> freeboard. [...] In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough sea anchor, which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped. [...] In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron, bound for Quebec. [...] As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron. [...] McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.|$|E

500|$|In Traveling Shoes, Angelou {{has matured}} {{as a writer}} {{to the point that}} she can {{experiment}} with form. [...] For the first time, instead of using traditional numbered chapters, the book consists of anecdotes separated with a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> white space. [...] Lupton calls these segments [...] "short stories or vignettes", a technique that Angelou had used before, to portray dynamic characters such as Malcolm X. [...] Angelou's stories are told within the context of her entire life story, but each vignette can be read or analyzed individually, without harming the text's consistency. [...] Most of Angelou's anecdotes no longer focus on the famous or her family, but on Ghanaians; for example, according to Lupton, her description of her houseboy Kojo is her most delightful character sketch in the book.|$|E
500|$|The Coldrum Stones {{have been}} {{excavated}} on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J. Bennett began excavation at the site, after previously having uncovered some Neolithic lithics from Addington Long Barrow. He soon discovered human bones [...] "under only a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> chalky soil". He {{returned to the}} site for further excavation in August 1910, this time with his niece and her husband, {{both of whom were}} dentists with an interest in craniology; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull, which they were able to largely reconstruct. A few days later he returned to excavate on the north-west corner of the chamber with the architect E. W. Filkins; that day, they found a second skull, further bones, a flint tool, and pieces of pottery. This pottery was later identified as being Anglo-Saxon in date.|$|E
500|$|The storm also {{produced}} heavy rainfall in Indian River County, with [...] reported in Vero Beach. This {{was the highest}} observed precipitation total {{in the state of}} Florida during Isaac. Elsewhere in Indian River County, rainfall amounts were generally between [...] Throughout Indian River County, 27homes and 2singlefamily homes were flooded, while 20roads were temporarily closed due to standing water. An EF0 tornado touched down in Vero Beach for about two minutes, damaging 118mobile homes and 15single family houses. According to Indian River County Emergency Management Coordinator Dale Justice, that tornado caused $850,000 in losses. At the Vero Beach Municipal Airport, sustained winds reached [...] In Highlands County, up to [...] of rain forced the closure of a small portion of U.S. Route 98 between Cowhouse Road and County Road 621 in Lorida.

25|$|Portland {{experiences}} a temperate climate with both oceanic and Mediterranean features. This climate {{is characterized by}} warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The precipitation pattern is distinctly Mediterranean, with little to no rainfall occurring {{during the summer months}} {{and more than half of}} annual precipitation falling between November and February. Portland experiences somewhat cooler winters than areas of similar latitude on the west coast of Europe. Of the three most populated cities within the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Vancouver and Portland) Portland has the warmest average temperature, the highest number of sunshine hours, and the <b>fewest</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> rainfall and snowfall. According to the Köppen climate classification, Portland falls within the dry-summer mild temperate zone (Csb), also referred to as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate with a USDA Plant Hardiness Zones between 8b and 9a. Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, places it within the oceanic zone (Do), like much of the Pacific Northwest and Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|Pre-cut studs save a framer much time, {{because they}} are pre-cut by the {{manufacturer}} for use in 8-, 9-, and 10-ft (2.44, 2.74 and 3.05 m) ceiling applications, which means the manufacturer has removed a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> or centimetres <b>of</b> the piece {{to allow for the}} sill plate and the double top plate with no additional sizing necessary.|$|R
500|$|In central Greenland {{a typical}} year might produce {{two or three}} feet of winter snow, plus a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> summer snow. [...] When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up {{no more than a}} foot of ice. [...] The layers {{corresponding}} to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. [...] As the depth increases {{to the point where the}} ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. [...] Dust layers may now become visible. [...] Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. [...] These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.|$|E

25|$|Originally an {{armament}} {{of three}} machine guns was planned, with two Lewis guns firing forwards and downwards through the cockpit floor {{as in the}} TF.1, and a forward firing Vickers machine gun.

2500|$|Digging up the {{rhizomes}} is {{a common}} solution where the land is to be developed, as this is quicker than the use of herbicides, but safe disposal of the plant material without spreading it is difficult; knotweed is classed as controlled waste in the UK, and disposal is regulated by law. Digging up the roots is also very labour-intensive and not always efficient. The roots can go to up to [...] deep, and leaving only a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> root behind {{will result in the}} plant quickly growing back.|$|E
2500|$|Released under partial amnesty of March 1869, {{because of}} ill-health, and upon his release Kickham was made Chairman of the Supreme Council of the I.R.B. and, {{according}} to Devoy, ‘the unchallenged leader’ of the reorganized movement.

60|$|Mattress.--Making a {{mattress}} {{is indeed a}} very simple affair. A bag of canvas, or other cloth, is made of the size wanted. It is then stuffed full of hair, wool, dry leaves, or cotton, and a strong stitch is put through it every <b>few</b> <b>inches.</b> The use <b>of</b> the stitching is to prevent the stuffing from being displaced, and forming lumps {{in different parts of}} the bag.|$|R

However, the dancer {{at the top of}} the tower is still a <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> short <b>of</b> the cylinder's top, and a loud clanging sound shakes the cylinder and sends the five tumbling to the ground. Now even more determined, the major fashions a grappling hook out of loose bits of clothing and his sword. By reforming the tower, he manages to grapple onto the edge of the cylinder. As he turns to survey the area surrounding the cylinder, he tumbles to the ground outside.|$|R
5000|$|Bosch is left-handed. He {{stands a}} <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> short <b>of</b> six feet and is {{described}} as wiry. His muscles are like nylon cords, strength concealed by economy of scale. He has a moustache and has brown hair that is by now graying (The Black Echo). Bosch's eyes are the other key aspect of his appearance; they are brown and nearly black, and were mentioned often for this reason in A Darkness More Than Night. Connelly gives a good clue as to how he visualizes Bosch when, in The Overlook, Rachel Walling tells Bosch that [...] "You look like House" [...] (actor Hugh Laurie).|$|R
