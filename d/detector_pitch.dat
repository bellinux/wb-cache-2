For diffraction-limited optics, the spatial cut-off frequency is ωc[*]=[*] 1 /(λ[*]×[*]f‒number).

Another critical parameter for an imaging system is the <b>detector</b> <b>pitch,</b> p, for the focal plane array. The pitch is the spacing between the detector elements, and one divided by the pitch is the sampling frequency. The Nyquist criterion dictates that to avoid aliasing, we must have 1 /p[*]>[*] 2 ωc. However, due to a complex trade space in imaging system design, many imaging systems do not meet the Nyquist criterion. This issue is addressed well in [24].

40|$|Detector {{sampling}} and optical blur {{are two major}} factors affecting Target Acquisition (TA) performance with modern EO and IR systems. In order to quantify their relative significance, we simulated five realistic LWIR and MWIR sensors from very under-sampled (<b>detector</b> <b>pitch</b> d >> diffraction blur Fλ) to well-sampled (Fλ >> d). Next, we measured their TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) sensor performance curve. The results show a region that is clearly detectorlimited, a region that is clearly diffraction-limited, and a transition area. For a high contrast target, threshold size TFPA on the sensor focal plane can mathematically be described with a simple linear expression: TFPA = 1. 5 ·d ·w(d/Fλ) + 0. 95 · Fλ·w(Fλ/d), w being a steep weighting function between 0 and 1. Next, tacticle vehicle identification range predictions with the TOD TA model and TTP (Targeting Task Performance) model where compared to measured ranges with human observers. The TOD excellently predicts performance for both well-sampled and under-sampled sensors. While earlier TTP versions (2001, 2005) showed a pronounced difference in the relative weight of {{sampling and}} blur to range, the predictions with the newest (2008) TTP version that considers in-band aliasing are remarkably close to the TOD.

40|$|PURPOSE: Nowadays, {{there are}} many {{different}} applications that use small fields in radiotherapy treatments. The dosimetry of small radiation fields is not trivial due to the problems associated with lateral disequilibrium and source occlusion and requires reliable quality assurance (QA). Ideally such a QA tool should provide high spatial resolution, minimal beam perturbation and real time fast measurements. Many different types of silicon diode arrays are used for QA in radiotherapy; however, their application in small filed dosimetry is limited, in part, {{due to a lack of}} spatial resolution. The Center of Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) has developed a new generation of a monolithic silicon diode array detector that will be useful for small field dosimetry in SRS/SRT. The objective of this study is to characterize a monolithic silicon diode array designed for dosimetry QA in SRS/SRT named DUO that is arranged as two orthogonal 1 D arrays with 0. 2 mm pitch. METHODS: DUO is two orthogonal 1 D silicon detector arrays in a monolithic crystal.

40|$|MicroPET II is a second-generation animal PET scanner {{designed}} for high-resolution imaging of small laboratory rodents. The system consists of 90 scintillation detector modules arranged in three contiguous axial rings with a ring diameter of 16. 0 cm and an axial length of 4. 9 cm. Each detector module {{consists of a}} 14 x 14 array of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals coupled to a multi-channel photomultiplier tube (MC-PMT) through a coherent optical fibre bundle. Each LSO crystal element measures 0. 975 mm x 0. 975 mm in cross section by 12. 5 mm in length. A barium sulphate reflector material was used between LSO elements leading to a <b>detector</b> <b>pitch</b> of 1. 15 mm in both axial and transverse directions. Fused optical fibre bundles were made from 90 mum diameter glass fibres with a numerical aperture of 0. 56. Interstitial extramural absorber was added between the fibres to reduce optical cross talk. A charge-division readout circuit was implemented on printed circuit boards to decode the 196 crystals in each array from the outputs of the 64 anode signals of the MC-PMT. Electronics from Concorde Microsystems Inc. (Knoxville, TN) were used for signal amplification, digitization, event qualification, coincidence processing and data capture. Coincidence data were passed to a host PC that recorded events in list mode. Following acquisition, data were sorted into sinograms and reconstructed using Fourier rebinning and filtered backprojection algorithms. Basic evaluation of the system has been completed. The absolute sensitivity of the microPET II scanner was 2. 26 % at {{the centre of the}} field of view (CFOV) for an energy window of 250 - 750 keV and a timing window of 10 ns. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the detectors in the system averaged 1. 21 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) when measured with a Na- 22 point source 0. 5 mm in diameter. Reconstructed image resolution ranged from 0. 83 mm FWHM at the CFOV to 1. 47 mm FWHM in the radial direction, 1. 17 mm FWHM in the tangential direction and 1. 42 mm FWHM in the axial direction at 1 cm offset from the CFOV. These values represent highly significant improvements over our earlier microPET scanner (approximately fourfold sensitivity increase and 25 - 35 % improvement in linear spatial resolution under equivalent operating conditions) and are expected to be further improved when the system is fully optimized...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} research and development of a new low-cost medium wavelength IR (MWIR) monolithic imager technology for high-speed uncooled industrial applications. It takes the baton on the latest technological advances in the field of vapour phase deposition (VPD) PbSe-based MWIR detection accomplished by the industrial partner NIT S. L., adding fundamental knowledge on the investigation of novel VLSI analog and mixed-signal design techniques at circuit and system levels {{for the development of the}} readout integrated device attached to the detector. The work supports on the hypothesis that, by the use of the preceding design techniques, current standard inexpensive CMOS technologies fulfill all operational requirements of the VPD PbSe detector in terms of connectivity, reliability, functionality and scalability to integrate the device. The resulting monolithic PbSe-CMOS camera must consume very low power, operate at kHz frequencies, exhibit good uniformity and fit the CMOS read-out active pixels in the compact pitch of the focal plane, all while addressing the particular characteristics of the MWIR detector: high dark-to-signal ratios, large input parasitic capacitance values and remarkable mismatching in PbSe integration. In order to achieve these demands, this thesis proposes null inter-pixel crosstalk vision sensor architectures based on a digital-only focal plane array (FPA) of configurable pixel sensors. Each digital pixel sensor (DPS) cell is equipped with fast communication modules, self-biasing, offset cancellation, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and fixed pattern noise (FPN) correction. In-pixel power consumption is minimized by the use of comprehensive MOSFET subthreshold operation. The main aim is to potentiate the integration of PbSe-based infra-red (IR) -image sensing technologies so as to widen its use, not only in distinct scenarios, but also at different stages of PbSe-CMOS integration maturity. For this purpose, we posit to investigate a comprehensive set of functional blocks distributed in two parallel approaches: - Frame-based "Smart" MWIR imaging based on new DPS circuit topologies with gain and offset FPN correction capabilities. This research line exploits the <b>detector</b> <b>pitch</b> to offer fully-digital programmability at pixel level and complete functionality with input parasitic capacitance compensation and internal frame memory. - Frame-free "Compact"-pitch MWIR vision based on a novel DPS loss-less analog integrator and configurable temporal difference, combined with asynchronous communication protocols inside the focal plane. This strategy is conceived to allow extensive pitch compaction and readout speed increase by the suppression of in-pixel digital filtering, and the use of dynamic bandwidth allocation in each pixel of the FPA. In order make the electrical validation of first prototypes independent of the expensive PbSe deposition processes at wafer level, investigation is extended as well to the development of affordable sensor emulation strategies and integrated test platforms specifically oriented to image read-out integrated circuits. DPS cells, imagers and test chips have been integrated and characterized in standard 0. 15 -micron 1 P 6 M, 0. 35 -micron 2 P 4 M and 2. 5 -micron 2 P 1 M CMOS technologies, all as part of research projects with industrial partnership. The research has led to the first high-speed uncooled frame-based IR quantum imager monolithically fabricated in a standard VLSI CMOS technology, and has given rise to the Tachyon series [1], a new line of commercial IR cameras used in real-time industrial, environmental and transportation control systems. The frame-free architectures investigated in this work represent a firm step forward to push further pixel pitch and system bandwidth up to the limits imposed by the evolving PbSe detector in future generations of the device.

Note’s total harmonic strength is computed by adding the magnitude of all partials which are part of the note using a weighting function for each partial. Partial cancellation is used to discourage reuse of partials and thus ignoring ghost notes. The onset detector is based on two detection functions: Spectral Flux and High Frequency Content. Both methods operate in the frequency domain an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{high-quality}} <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> {{has been}} built in digital hard-ware and operates in real time at a 10 kl-Iz sampling rate. The hardware is capable of providing energy as well as pitch-period esthnates. The pitch and energy computations are performed 100 times/s (i. e., once per 10 ms interval). The algorithm to estimate the pitch period uses center clipping, infinite peak clipping, and a simplified autocorrelation analysis. The analysis is performed on a 300 sample section of speech which is both center clipped and infinite peak clipped, yielding a three-level speech signal where the levels are — 1, 0, and + 1 depending on {{the relation of the}} original speech sample to the clipping threshold. Thus computation of the autocorrelation function of the clipped speech is easily implemented in digital hardware using simple combinatorial logic, i. e., an up-down counter can be used to compute each correla-tion point. The <b>pitch</b> <b>detector</b> has been interfaced to the NOVA com-puter facility of the Acoustics Research Department at Bell Laboratories. I...|$|R
