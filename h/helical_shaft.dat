50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the <b>helical</b> <b>shaft</b> and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the <b>helical</b> <b>shaft</b> by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|E

A simplified theory for the convective hydrodynamics prevalent under these conditions has been formulated. Experimental data are presented to verify the steady-state character of the current-potential curves and the predicted dependence of the limiting current on the rotation speed of the rotor, the bulk concentration of the depolariser and the viscosity of the solution. Promising features of the multiple-segment electrodes concentric to a central disc electrode are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper takes a <b>helical</b> gear <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of <b>helical</b> gear <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the <b>helical</b> gear <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} curvature location along an artificial canal on cyclic fatigue (CF) of an Mtwo rotary instrument, verifying the number of cycles to fatigue fracture (NCF) and morphologic characteristics of the fractured instruments. Study designCF testing of instruments was performed in artificial canals with curvature radii of 10 mm and arc lengths of 11 mm. Mtwo rotary instruments size 40, 0. 04 taper were used in 2 groups (n = 10) : group A, curvature positioned on middle part; group B, apical curvature. All instruments were rotated until fracture. The number of cycles to failure was registered. Data were analyzed by independent sample t test. Fractured surfaces and the <b>helical</b> <b>shafts</b> of the instruments were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. ResultsNCF for groups A and B had significant statistic differences (P <. 05). The highest values {{were found in the}} group where the curvature was positioned on the apical part of the canal. No plastic deformation was observed on the <b>helical</b> <b>shafts.</b> ConclusionsThe number of cycles to fracture of the Mtwo instruments increased when the arc was changed from the middle to the apical part of the canal.

In order to decrease this variation in static torque from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, a helical Savonius rotor {{with a twist}} of 90 degrees is proposed. In this study, tests on helical Savonius rotors are conducted in an open jet wind tunnel. Coefficient of static torque, coefficient of torque and coefficient of power for each helical Savonius rotor are measured. The performance of <b>helical</b> rotor with <b>shaft</b> between the end plates and <b>helical</b> rotor without <b>shaft</b> between the end plates at different overlap ratios namely 0. 0, 0. 1 and 0. 16 is compared. Helical Savonius rotor without shaft is also compared {{with the performance of}} the conventional Savonius rotor. The results indicate that all the helical Savonius rotors have positive coefficient of static torque at all the rotor angles. The <b>helical</b> rotors with <b>shaft</b> have lower coefficient of power than the <b>helical</b> rotors without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Helical</b> rotor without <b>shaft</b> at an overlap ratio of 0. 0 and an aspect ratio of 0. 88 is found to have almost the same coefficient of power when compared with the conventional Savonius rotor.

40|$|IntroductionThis study {{compared}} the torsional properties of 2 stainless steel endodontic pathfinding instruments: C-Pilot (VDW, Munich, Germany) and C+ files (Maillefer/Dentsply, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Stainless steel conventional K-type instruments (KCC+, VDW) {{were used as}} controls. MethodsFile sizes 10 were subjected to a torsional assay in clockwise rotation. The 2 parameters evaluated were maximum torque and angular deflection at failure. The fractured surfaces and the helical shafts of the fractured instruments were then examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ResultsThe {{results indicated that the}} angular deflection to fracture decreased in the following order: KCC+ > C-Pilot > C+. As for the maximum torque values, the results revealed the following descending order: C+ > KCC+ > C-Pilot. SEM analysis revealed that plastic deformation occurred along the <b>helical</b> <b>shaft</b> of the fractured instruments and that the fractured surfaces were of the ductile type. ConclusionsThe instruments tested showed different torsional behavior depending on the parameter evaluated. Considering that high angular deflection values may serve as a safety factor for instruments used as pathfinders, the conventional K file showed significantly better results than both C-Pilot and C+ files...|$|E

30|$|The square <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> pile {{is a deep}} {{foundation}} used for new foundations and underpins existing foundations. Favorable performance history and economic viability have made it a standard of practice {{in many parts of}} the United States where it is considered a long side its {{deep foundation}} cousins: the drilled cast in place concrete pier, the driven pile and the micro piles. In addition to underpinning light structures, today it is used for new foundations and to underpin multiple stories heavily loaded commercial and industrial structures. Problem soil sites with expansive clays, collapsible soils or high ground water conditions are especially well suited for the square <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> screw pile [7]. The use of square <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> pile foundations in swelling soils is a standard of practice in Colorado. Since 1986 it is estimated approximately 130, 000 square <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> piles have been installed for both remedial repair and foundations for new construction in swelling soils, including the high expansive steeply dipping bedrock areas. There are no documented failures or adverse performance of correctly specified and installed square <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> piles [1]. Helical piles represent an efficient deep foundation system used in a wide range applications varying from anchors for transmission towers to foundations for bridges and large industrial installations. Helical piles are made of a steel shaft either a solid square shaft or circular pipe with one or multiple helices attached to it. They are installed by employing rotational force applied through a drive head. The piles could be installed to any depth and at any angle provided that the soil conditions are tolerable and the pile is designed to withstand the applied torque from a suitable drive head [2].|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{testing for}} {{foundation}} design offers advantages over field-testing, especially, where existing installations preclude easy accessibility. Advantages include a homogeneous soil, ability to place instrumentation throughout the soil mass, and capacity {{to bring the}} system to failure, as well as control over the failure mechanism. Repeatability is also achievable. Laboratory work, however, has its own challenges. For model-scale work, a main impediment is scaling: strength, dimensions, and boundary conditions hinder accurate modeling of the soil and brings a difficulty in representing scaled foundations. This paper describes the construction-oriented solutions pioneered for meeting the geometric requirements of ⅛th scaled laboratory testing of composite deep foundations for existing foundation enhancement, including drilled <b>shafts,</b> <b>helical</b> piers, and grouting.

40|$|In the {{currently}} booming market of wind turbines, a clear focus {{is put on}} the design of reliable and cost-effective subsystems, such as the gearbox. A requirement for reliable gearbox design calculations is accurate load data and sufficient insight in the dynamics of the entire wind turbine drive train. To ensure this, considerable research effort is spent in advanced modelling and simulation techniques. The steadily increasing size of wind turbine gearboxes results in an increase of the influence of component flexibility. Therefore simulation models should accurately represent these. In this work the flexibile multibody modelling technique is used, as it directly includes the components’ flexibilities. A generic gearbox consisting of one planetary and two helical gear stages is modelled. A detailed estimation of the influence of the flexibility of <b>helical</b> gear stage <b>shafts</b> on the overall modal behaviour of the gearbox is discussed. The vibration modes are classified into global modes, planetary modes and helical modes. Rigid and flexible multibody models of the generic gearbox are compared. All comparisons show significant influence of the components’ flexibilities. Results are compared with results from previous work investigating the effect of flexibility on the modal behaviour of wind turbine gearboxes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cold rolling is an {{advanced}} splinterless processing method, {{which has been}} applied to process many parts, like spur gears, <b>helical</b> gears, spline <b>shaft</b> and ballscrew, etc. Ballscrew which determines the motion characteristics has been used as key transmission part of ballscrew pair. According to differential geometry and meshing theory, the mathematic model of ballscrew manufactured by cold rolling is built, and the normal section equation of ballscrew is derivated in this paper. The cold forming principle of ballscrew is investigated; the meshing model, the contact line and theoretical errors of the ballscrew are constructed. The objective moving laws between roller and workpiece are revealed by analyzing the meshing model and the contact line, the processing method of cold-rolling is considered as the generating method which can lay the foundation for roller design by analyzing forming principle. By analyzing the profile error and the error of the actual helix of the centrode of ball, the error generation causes are discovered, and the calculation methods of the profile error and the spiral error of ballscrew are proposed. By analyzing the error evolution and taking a certain type of ballscrew for example, the results indicate that the profile error is brought by roller designing, and the spiral error is caused by discontinuous contact...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel piling system is investigated, which involves a spun-cast ductile iron (SCDI) tapered shaft fitted with a lower helical plate. It combines {{the efficiency of the}} tapered section, the competitive cost, effectiveness and durability of spun cast ductile iron with a rough surface and the construction advantages of helical piles. The system is installed using a fast, low vibration and reduced noise process. Seven instrumented piles including five SCDI tapered and two steel straight pipes were installed in sand using mechanical torque. The piles were subjected to cyclic and monotonic compression, uplift and lateral load tests. Different loading sequences were adopted to assess the effect of prior cyclic/monotonic loading on the piles’ performance. The installation torque was monitored and the resulting capacity-to-torque ratio was compared to the literature reported values. The compaction of the previously disturbed sand from the helix penetration due to the pile taper resulted in superior compressive behavior of the proposed system compared to the straight shaft piles. The tapered piles exhibited higher stiffness at lower displacements compared to the straight shafted piles and the helix increased their uplift resistance. In addition, tapered shafts enhanced the lateral stiffness and the helix provided fixation due to the passive bearing pressures on the helix surfaces, which further improved the lateral {{performance of}} the short helical piles. A three dimensional finite element model was established and calibrated using the experimental data. The model was then used to simulate the response of SCDI piles with different configurations when subjected to different loading conditions including axial and lateral as well as combined moment-horizontal loads. Under cyclic loading, the tapered helical piles exhibited better compressive performance while the straight <b>shaft</b> <b>helical</b> piles performed better in uplift loading. The proposed system stiffness remained practically unchanged through the cyclic lateral loading applied in the current study. The monotonic performance of the tapered helical piles in clay was numerically simulated. The results showed an increase in axial and lateral capacity and stiffness of the tapered piles over the straight shaft ones, with greater uplift-to-compressive capacity ratio than in sand...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{manufacturing}} {{offers a}} number of operational and financial benefits to pharmaceutical companies. This research examines the critical blending step for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and the characteristics of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were used to develop novel insights into the mechanism of mixing for continuous blending of cohesive pharmaceutical powders and {{to examine the effects}} of particle properties, blender design and operating conditions on blend homogeneity. To place continuous blending into the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing, the scope of the analysis was expanded to process system models of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. DEM simulations were used to study the mechanisms of mixing in the continuous blending of pharmaceutical powders. Diffusive mixing from the avalanching particles appears to be the dominant mechanism of mixing in both the axial and radial direction for the double helical ribbon blender. This result can guide the development of future continuous pharmaceutical powder blenders by optimizing the mixing elements to increase the amount of particles transported to a position where they can avalanche/flow and diffusively mix. A range of particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions were examined for their effects on flow behavior and blend homogeneity. Three particle properties were examined: particle size, polydispersity and cohesive force. (cont.) Particle size was observed to be positively correlated to both flow rates and blend homogeneity. Polydispersity had no effect on flow rate and was negatively correlated to homogeneity. Cohesive force was negatively correlated to flow rate and had little to no effect on homogeneity. Two modifications of blender design were analyzed: changes in blender size and changes in shaft design. Blender size was observed to be positively correlated to flow rate and negatively correlated to homogeneity. The paddle shaft designs created a more homogeneous powder blend than the double <b>helical</b> ribbon <b>shaft.</b> Two operating parameters were also studied: rotation rate and fill fraction. Rotation rate was positively correlated to both flow rate and homogeneity. Fill fraction had the interesting result of being positively correlated to the absolute flow rate, but negatively correlated to the fill mass normalized flow rate. In addition, fill fraction has a clear negative correlation to homogeneity above fill fractions of 0. 55, but is inconsistent for fill fractions lower than this. This research on particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions will help to guide the operation of continuous pharmaceutical blenders and the design of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Process simulations comparing model batch and continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems have quantified some of the potential size, cost and performance benefits of continuous processes. The models showed significant reductions in process equipment sizes for continuous manufacturing particularly in the blending step. (cont.) This reduction in equipment size translates to capital cost (CAPEX) savings for both the continuous process equipment and manufacturing facilities. The steady state operation of continuous processing also reduces the labor requirements and gives the continuous processes an operating cost (OPEX) advantage over batch processes. This research has contributed to the understanding of continuous pharmaceutical powder blending and quantified some of the benefits of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. This work is being continued by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing whose work is providing the foundation for future industrial scale pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing systems. by Matthew J.
