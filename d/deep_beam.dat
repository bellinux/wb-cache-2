The CFRP has become an alternative solution to this issue and being extensively used as an external reinforcement to resolve the strength requirements in structural systems due to extremely strong yet light weight, outstanding fatigue properties, excellent corrosion resistance and easy yet efficient application on concrete. This experimental study is focuses on {{the investigation of the}} effect of CFRP wrap in strengthening RC deep beams with large square openings located in shear zone.

A total of four RC deep beams which included a solid RC control beam, a <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> with two large square openings, and two beams with two large square openings strengthened by using CFRP strips in different strengthening configurations, were tested to failure under four point loading to determine the relative structural behaviour such as ultimate load, failure mode, crack patterns, and load deflection behaviour. All RC deep beams were designed in a dimension of 120 x 600 mm and 2400 mm in length. The width and height of large square openings were in a dimension of 270 x 270 mm and located 300 mm {{from the edge of the}} <b>deep</b> <b>beam.</b> The loading point and support were located at 800 mm and 300 mm from the edge of the <b>deep</b> <b>beam,</b> respectively.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerStrut-and-Tie {{models are}} useful in {{designing}} reinforced concrete structures with discontinuity regions where linear stress distribution is not valid. Deep beams are typically short girders with a large point load or multiple point loads. These point loads, {{in conjunction with the}} depth and length of the members, contribute to a member with primarily discontinuity regions. ACI 318 - 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete provides a method for designing deep beams using either Strut-and-Tie models (STM) or <b>Deep</b> <b>Beam</b> Method (DBM). This report compares dimension requirements, concrete quantities, steel quantities, and constructability of the two methods through the design of three different deep beams. The three designs consider the same single span <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> with varying height and loading patterns. The first design is a single span <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> with a large point load at the center girder. The second design is the <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> with the same large point load at a quarter point of the girder. The last design is the <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> with half the load at the midpoint and the other half at the quarter point. These three designs allow consideration of different shear and STM model geometry and design considerations. Comparing the two different designs shows the shear or cracking control reinforcement reduces by an average 13 % because the STM considers the extra shear capacity through arching action. The tension steel used for either flexure or the tension tie increases by an average of 16 % from <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> in STM design. This is due to STM taking shear force through tension in the tension reinforcement through arching action. The main advantage of the STM is the ability to decreased member depth without decreasing shear reinforcement spacing. If the member depth is not a concern in the design, the preferred method is DBM unless the designer is familiar with STMs due to the similarity of <b>deep</b> <b>beam</b> and regular beam design theory...|$|E

In order to investigate the effect of axial loads on the structural behaviors of the deep RC beams, specimens are prepared to have different shear span-to-depth ratios and subjected to axial loads of 235 kN or 470 kN.

Current design provisions in {{codes of practice}} fail to predict accurately and reliably the shear capacity of RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> {{and in some cases}} they are unsafe. This work aims to develop {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> and governing parameters, and to improve existing design methods to more accurately predict the shear capacity of such members. An extensive experimental programme examining 24 RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> is carried out. The investigated parameters include concrete strength, shear span to depth ratio, shear reinforcement and member depth. To develop a better insight on the distribution and magnitude of developed stresses in the shear span, finite element analysis is also performed. The microplane model M 4 is implemented as a VUMAT code in ABAQUS to represent the behaviour of concrete in a more reliable manner and validated against experimental tests on RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams.</b> This model is utilised in a parametric study to further investigate the effect of concrete strength, shear span to depth ratio and shear reinforcement. The experimental and numerical results show that concrete strength and shear span to depth ratio are the two most important parameters in controlling the behaviour of RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams,</b> and that shear strength is size dependent. The analysis also shows that minimum amount of shear reinforcement can increase the shear capacity of RC <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> by around 20...|$|R

40|$|Most {{codes of}} practice, such as EC 2 and ACI 318 - 05, {{recommend}} {{the use of}} strut-and-tie models {{for the design of}} reinforced concrete <b>deep</b> <b>beams.</b> However, studies on the validity of the strut-and-tie models for continuous <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> are rare. This paper evaluates the strut-and-tie model specified by ACI 318 - 05 and mechanism analysis of the plasticity theory in predicting the load capacity of 75 reinforced concrete continuous <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> tested in the literature. The influence of such main parameters as compressive strength of concrete, shear span-to-overall depth ratio, main longitudinal bottom reinforcement, and shear reinforcement on the load capacity is also investigated using both methods and experimental results. Experimental results were closer to the predictions obtained from the mechanism analysis than the strut-and-tie model. The strut-and-tie model highly overestimated the load capacity of continuous <b>deep</b> <b>beams</b> without shear reinforcement...|$|R
