5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. <b>Frequent</b> <b>travelers</b> can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. <b>Frequent</b> <b>travelers</b> can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
5|$|Toll {{collection}} {{started the}} day after the opening, and lasted until 24 May 2007. Seventy percent of the costs were to be covered by the state, and thirty percent through toll fees. The debt was borrowed by the private company that was given a concession to operate a toll plaza on the Inderøy side. Including interest, NOK80 million was collected, and the bridge was paid off three years before schedule. The Vanvikan-based company was disestablished following the closure of the plaza. Until only a few years before the closing, it was the only toll plaza in Nord-Trøndelag. There were several price increases during the toll period. The bridge was free for pedestrians and cyclists, but all motor vehicles were charged, although discounts were available for <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers.</b> The plaza was manned, and did not take into use Autopass, like many other plazas.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 1990s, Mark Travel Group, led by Bill LaMacchia, Jr., {{acquired}} Sun Country {{and began}} changing {{the focus of}} the small niche-market airline. Much of the 1990s were a tough period for the airline, as an aging and over-worked fleet coupled with record demand stretched the airline to its limits. New management began an aircraft refurbishing program designed at improving the experience of Sun Country's passengers. As the DC-10 aircraft aged and required expensive maintenance, the airline gradually reduced the fleet, ultimately retiring the final DC-10 in early 2001. As major airlines became more sophisticated in managing their seat inventories, the demand for tour charter flying fell off. In June 1999 the management of Sun Country launched a major transformation from a charter carrier into a scheduled airline. New service from Minneapolis and Milwaukee began to destinations around the nation, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Phoenix. The airline also started a frequent flyer program, Smile Awards, which offered <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers</b> free flights, among other benefits. In 2001, Sun Country began to replace its entire fleet with new Boeing 737 next-generation aircraft. As Sun Country reinvented itself, heavy competition from local incumbent carrier Northwest Airlines and the September 11 attacks caused a sharp decrease of traffic and revenue. Contrary to its tradition of financial success and profitability, the airline was losing large amounts of money by the summer of 2001. After fighting to stay operational by cutting flights, destinations and planes, the company closed on December 8, 2001.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Registered Travelers Program, in {{its current}} form, does not exempt members {{from any of the}} {{security}} checks of the TSA, it is often criticized as merely being a method by which <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers</b> can pay an annual fee to a private company in order to be permitted to move {{to the head of the}} TSA line and not wait their turn along with less <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers.</b> [...] Since the TSA lines are a government program (funded by equal payments on tickets of <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers</b> and non-travelers), this strikes many as being unfair to less <b>frequent</b> <b>travelers.</b>|$|E

40|$|International tourism {{integrates}} {{itself into}} the complex world of contemporary global affairs through its dependence on telecommunications technologies and its tolerance for widely fluctuating political, economic, and social conditions.

The world’s infrastructure has been transformed radical-ly over the last 30 years, {{largely as a result}} of political, geophysical, and technological developments. As a result, modem international relations are characterized by a number of new participants, institutions, and issues beyond that of the conventional nation-state system.
