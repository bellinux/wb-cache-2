5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When {{the right amount of}} ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E

Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around. This is used to signify cunnilingus and the gesture is often off-colour.|$|E

25|$|Two major pieces (queens or rooks) {{can easily}} force checkmate {{on the edge}} of the board. The process <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> two pieces on {{adjacent}} ranks or files and gradually force the king to the side of the board, where one piece keeps the king {{on the edge of}} the board while the other delivers checkmate. In the illustration, white checkmates by forcing the black king to the edge, one row at a time. The same process can also be used to checkmate with two rooks, or with two queens.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} {{is located}} in the wide end of the re-entry cone, where it can be larger, and thus more powerful. The usual arrangement <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> heavier, denser secondary in the narrow end for greater aerodynamic stability during re-entry from outer space, and to allow more room for a bulky primary in the wider part of the cone. (The W87 warhead drawing in the W87 article shows the usual arrangement.) Because of this new geometry, the W88 primary uses compact conventional high explosives (CHE) to save space, rather than the more usual, and bulky but safer, insensitive high explosives (IHE). The re-entry cone probably has ballast in the nose for aerodynamic stability.|$|E
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way to do this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement {{along the length of the}} tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|In English {{and other}} {{languages}} like Spanish—although the usual order of names is [...] "first middle last"—for {{the purpose of}} cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to [...] "last, first middle," [...] with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name.

2500|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} controls {{a wide range of}} involuntary and unconscious body functions. [...] Its main branches are the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. [...] Broadly speaking, the function of the sympathetic nervous system is to mobilize the body for action: [...] the slogan often used for it is fight-or-flight. The function of the parasympathetic nervous system <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> body in a state conducive to rest, regeneration, digestion, and reproduction: [...] it is sometimes described using the slogans [...] "rest and digest" [...] or [...] "feed and breed". [...] Both branches use acetylcholine, but in different ways.|$|E
2500|$|In English, {{the first}} {{sentence}} can be rendered as [...] "I sent the book to the man" [...] and as [...] "I sent the man the book", where the indirect object is identified in English by {{standing in front of}} the direct object. The normal word order in German <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> dative in front of the accusative (as in the example above). However, since the German dative is marked in form, it can also be put after the accusative: Ich schickte das Buch dem Mann(e). The (e) after Mann and Kind signifies a now largely archaic -e ending for certain nouns in the dative. It survives today almost exclusively in set phrases such as zu Hause (to the house, lit. going home), im Zuge (in the course of), and am Tage (in the afternoon), as well as in occasional usage in formal prose, poetry, and song lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "nonviolence" [...] {{is often}} linked with or {{used as a}} synonym for peace, and despite being {{frequently}} equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists. Nonviolence refers specifically {{to the absence of}} violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing. [...] Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} ways to define the {{proportionality}} constant of Henry's law, which can be subdivided into two fundamental types: One possibility <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> aqueous phase into the numerator and the gas phase into the denominator ("aq/gas"). This results in the Henry's law solubility constant [...] Its value increases with increased solubility. Alternatively, numerator and denominator can be switched ("gas/aq"), which results in the Henry's law volatility constant [...] The value of [...] decreases with increased solubility. There are several variants of both fundamental types. This results from the multiplicity of quantities that can be chosen to describe the composition of the two phases. Typical choices for the aqueous phase are molar concentration (...) , molality (...) , and molar mixing ratio (...) [...] For the gas phase, molar concentration (...) and partial pressure (...) are often used. It is not possible to use the gas-phase mixing ratio (...) because at a given gas-phase mixing ratio, the aqueous-phase concentration [...] depends on the total pressure and thus the ratio [...] is not a constant. To specify the exact variant of the Henry's law constant, two superscripts are used. They refer to the numerator and the denominator of the definition. For example, [...] refers to the Henry solubility defined as [...]|$|E
2500|$|Not {{content with}} putting Arthur in prison, Willy spends the {{beginning}} of 1996 trying to woo Pauline in his absence, even taking her on holiday to Jersey. However, this proves to be Willy's undoing, after Mark correctly surmises that his real motive <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> stolen money in an off-shore account under a false name. The evidence continues to stack up when Pauline discovers counterfeit credit cards on Willy. Willy is eventually arrested and charged, and Arthur is cleared. However, before the family can pass on the good news, they are told that Arthur {{has been involved in}} a huge prison riot. Arthur is released the next day, but he had received a nasty blow to the head in the riot, although no one realises the seriousness of his injury until it is too late. A few days after his release in May 1996, Arthur suffers a brain haemorrhage on the allotments, and dies the next day in hospital. Arthur's funeral is delayed pending an inquest, but the jury eventually returns a verdict of accidental death, much to the disgust of Mark and Pauline, who believe that the prison services neglected to seek proper medical help for Arthur. A bench is placed in dedication to his memory in Albert Square; the dedication is entitled [...] "Arthur Fowler: He loved this place". In 2007, after Pauline's death, Dot Cotton (June Brown) buries her ashes at Arthur's grave.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Eóganachta were {{powerful}} in Munster, they never provided Ireland with a High King. Serious {{challenges to the}} Uí Néill were however presented by Cathal mac Finguine and Feidlimid mac Cremthanin. They were not widely recognized as High Kings or Kings of Tara, as they {{did not belong to}} the Uí Néill, but they controlled territories as large or larger than those of the other dynasty. The kings of the Hill of Tara were sometimes called High Kings but were not recognized as kings of all Ireland in the historical period. However, this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> supposed position of [...] "High King of Ireland" [...] on a platform that it probably never enjoyed. The social structure of Gaelic Ireland was extremely complex, hierarchically oriented and aristocratic in concept. At the summit of society stood the king of a province, variously styled in the law texts as [...] "King of great kings" [...] (...) , [...] "Chief of kings" [...] (...) and [...] "The ultimate king of every individual" [...] (...) [...] From his justice there was no appeal, nor did the Brehon Law acknowledge the existence of the High Kingship of Ireland. The ri ruirech had no legal superior. In Munster this legal theory was explicitly adhered to by the annalists who styled the provincial kings as [...] "High King" [...] (...) , thereby stressing his absolute sovereignty. As the concept of the High Kingship of Ireland was developed from the 9th century onwards by the Uí Néill clan, the kings of Munster counterbalanced that historically inaccurate doctrine by stressing their alternative right to that title, or instead the enjoyment of full sovereignty in Leth Mogha, that part of Ireland south of a line from Dublin to Galway.|$|E
