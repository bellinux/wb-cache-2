25|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} to a JPEG image {{can be performed}} losslessly (that is, without recompression and the associated quality loss) {{as long as the}} <b>image</b> <b>size</b> is a multiple of 1 MCU block (Minimum Coded Unit) (usually 16 pixels in both directions, for 4:2:0 chroma subsampling). Utilities that implement this include jpegtran, with user interface Jpegcrop, and the JPG_TRANSFORM plugin to IrfanView.|$|E
25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The <b>image</b> <b>size</b> {{is the same as the}} object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Riga-made Minox had a brass chassis {{covered in}} a stainless steel shell, which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows, {{as well as to}} advance the film. It was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder, which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20cm, and, due to its small <b>image</b> <b>size,</b> provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window. These were advanced features at the time for any camera, regardless of size.|$|E

Even for large numbers of {{processing}} cores, where the efficiency is expected to drop, the value sustains for larger <b>image</b> <b>sizes.</b> These results are evidence that the proposed parallel implementation of the correntropy coefficient {{has a very good}} scalability w.r.t. the scalings of the multi-core era.|$|R

25|$|The PlayStation Move motion {{controller}} {{features an}} orb {{at the head}} which can glow in any of {{a full range of}} colors using RGB light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Based on the colors in the user environment captured by the camera, the system dynamically selects an orb color that can be distinguished {{from the rest of the}} scene. The colored light serves as an active marker, the position of which can be tracked along the image plane by the camera. The uniform spherical shape and known size of the light also allows the system to simply determine the controller's distance from the camera through the light's <b>image</b> <b>size,</b> thus enabling the controller's position to be tracked in three dimensions with high precision and accuracy. The simple sphere-based distance calculation allows the controller to operate with minimal processing latency, as opposed to other camera-based control techniques on the PlayStation 3.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, {{the company}} brought out Primo, {{a new line}} of lenses. Designed with a {{consistent}} color match between all the different focal-length instruments in the line, these were also the sharpest lenses yet manufactured by Panavision. Six years later, Oscars were awarded to the company and to three of its employees for their work on the Primo 3:1 zoom lens: Iain Neil for the optical design, Rick Gelbard for the mechanical design, and Eric Dubberke for the lens's engineering. According to the AMPAS citation, [...] "The high contrast and absence of flare, along with its ability to provide close focusing and to maintain constant <b>image</b> <b>size</b> while changing focus, make the Primo 3:1 Zoom Lens truly unique." [...] In 1991, the company released its new 65mm technology, System 65, though Arri had beaten it to market by two years with the Arriflex 765. The gauge was not widely readopted, and only two major Hollywood films were shot with the new 65mm Panavision process: Far and Away (1992) and Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).|$|E

2500|$|Macropsia may be {{a result}} of optical {{magnification}} differences between the eyes, retinal receptor distribution, or the cortical processing of the sampled image. The current hypothesis for the occurrence of dysmetropsia is due to the stretching or compression of the retina leading to the displacement of receptors. [...] Macropsia arises from a compressed receptor distribution leading to a larger perceived <b>image</b> <b>size</b> and conversely, micropsiaresults from stretching of the retina leading to a more sparse receptor distribution that gives a smaller perceived <b>image</b> <b>size.</b> [...] In the case of macropsia, the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger. [...] In some cases, the effects of macropsia {{have been shown to be}} field dependent, in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle. [...] Non-uniform stretching or compression of the receptor distribution could explain the field dependency of the macrospia. [...] If the compression forces were closer to the fovea the resulting compression would cause a greater amount of macropsia at lower field angles with little effect at higher field angles where the receptor distribution is not as compressed. [...] Alterations in receptor distribution can be the result of epiretinal membrane, neuroretina detachment and/or re-attachment, or retinoschisis. [...] Macropsia caused by surgical re-attachment of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is not symmetrical around the fovea, resulting in differences size changes in the horizontal and vertical meridians. [...] Asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis, in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction.|$|E

40|$|The A 0 photoinjector (A 0 PI) {{facility}} at Fermilab has an ongoing proof-of-principle experiment {{to demonstrate the}} exchange of the transverse horizontal and longitudinal emittances. This experiment relies on measurements of the transverse emittances and longitudinal emittance upstream and downstream of the exchanger beamline. At several locations along the accelerator beamline, YAG:Ce powder scintillator screens are used to determine beam size, divergence when the screen is downstream {{of a set of}} 50 -micron-wide tungsten slits, and energy spread when used in an electron beam spectrometer. We have recently performed direct comparisons of beam image and slit <b>image</b> <b>sizes</b> using both the optical transition radiation (OTR) screens and the YAG:Ce screens. For micropulse charges of 250 pC and with beam energies of 15 MeV, we systematically observed larger beam <b>image</b> <b>sizes</b> with the YAG:Ce screens than with the OTR screens. We deduced a YAG:Ce screen spatial resolution limit of sigma = 140 to 180 microns. This term is large enough relative to the actual beam <b>sizes</b> and slit <b>image</b> <b>sizes</b> to be needed as a correction term subtracted in quadrature...|$|R
