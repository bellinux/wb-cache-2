5|$|After the Wind of Change of {{the early}} 1960s, the British {{government}} under Harold Wilson and the predominantly white minority government of the self-governing colony of Rhodesia, led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, were unable to agree terms for the latter's full independence. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. This was deemed illegal by Britain and the United Nations (UN), each of which imposed <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1942, the Allies {{provided}} military aid, {{and then}} they began imposing <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> in 1943 to force Turkey to enter the war.

5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement.

5|$|Following {{a dispute}} over the terms for the {{granting}} of full statehood, the predominantly white minority government of Rhodesia, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965. Because British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Whitehall had been insisting on an immediate transfer to majority rule before independence, this declaration went unrecognised and caused Britain and the United Nations (UN) to impose <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{argues that}} studies of <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> effectiveness {{suffer from a}} selection bias by considering only those sanctions that are deployed and not just threatened. These sanction threats, it is argued, should be more successful because both sender and target {{have an incentive to}} solve their dispute before entering into a costly <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> episode. Testing this assertion is somewhat problematic because sanction threats are, in essence, non-events— sanctions that were never deployed. This paper provides an empirical assessment of one set of threatened economic sanctions—the U. S. threats to revoke or condition China’s MFN status from 1989 to 1995. We show that Washington’s threats did not affect the level of Chinese political repression and actually decreased the human rights accommodations offered by Beijing. Further, when China was cooperative, the U. S. de-escalated its threats. We do not conclude that sanction threats are generally ineffective but that sanction threats directed at human rights behavior create expectations of future conflict that result in their failure. Theoretically, the results highlight the importance of considering the impact that the target’s behavior has on the sender’s sanction decisions. The results also suggest that engagement with countries openin...|$|R
50|$|The term {{economic}} oppression, sometimes misunderstood in {{the sense}} of <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> embargo or <b>economic</b> boycott, has a different meaning and significance, and its meaning as well as its significance has been changing over a period of time, and its contextual application. Economic oppression may take several forms, including the practice of bonded labour in some parts of India; serfdom; forced labour; low wages; denial of equal opportunity; practicing employment discrimination; and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{founding}} of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Tsai continued his cooperation with the new government. The Korean War broke out a year later. The U.S. and its allies’ <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> against Mainland China sealed Mayar’s fate. Facing the sanction together with industrial nationalization in China, Tsai retreated and retired to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, his legacy of industrial ambition and entrepreneurial zest has continued in his family by Yang Yuan-loong and Marjorie Yang Mun-tak who have since built up a world-class textile company, Esquel Group.|$|R
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Rhodesia in December 1966. Over {{the next}} year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over {{the country with the}} unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that as he saw it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E
40|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that natural resources {{can influence the}} likelihood, course and outcome of armed conflicts. Much of these relationships depend on the institutional setting in which the conflict and resource exploitation occurs, and the specific characteristics of resources involved. This paper examines the relevance of two broad resource characteristics-lootability and legality-for conflict termination initiatives. Observing revenue sharing, <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> and military interventions {{in a total of}} 26 conflicts between 1989 and 2006, the paper suggests that resource characteristics can affect the effectiveness of resource-related conflict termination instruments...|$|R
50|$|Article 21 bis, {{added to}} the treaty by a 1971 amendment, gives the INCB more {{enforcement}} power by allowing it to deduct from a nation's production quota of cannabis, opium, and coca the amounts it determines have been produced within that nation and introduced into the illicit traffic. This could happen {{as a result of}} failing to control either illicit production or diversion of licitly produced opium to illicit purposes. In this way, the INCB can essentially punish a narcotics-exporting nation that does not control its illicit traffic by imposing an <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> on its medicinal narcotics industry.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the Protocol added Article 21 bis, Limitation of Production of Opium, {{which allowed}} the Board to deduct from a nation's opium {{production}} quota the amounts it determines {{have been produced}} within that nation and introduced into the illicit traffic. This could happen {{as a result of}} failing to control either illicit production or diversion of licitly produced opium to illicit purposes. In this way, the Board can essentially punish a nation that does not control its illicit opium traffic by imposing an <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> on its medicinal opium industry. This provision is ineffective on nations that are not opium exporters.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} {{increased to}} about 20,000 as Serb refugees {{from other parts}} of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> and lack of international aid.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build {{a good relationship with}} white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E
5000|$|A 2002 {{article by}} economists Seema Jayachandran and Michael Kremer renewed {{interest}} in this topic.

Jayachandran proposed new recommendations in November 2010 at the 10th anniversary of the Jubilee movement at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the loan sanctions model has been adapted by the Centre for Global Developments and has been the base for a number of further suggestions.

40|$|In the literature, {{scholars}} have linked {{various aspects of}} the economic philosophy of neoliberalism to a variety of foreign policy behaviors. However, these studies typically only utilize one aspect of neoliberalism in their analyses. In this dissertation, I examine three types of foreign policy behaviors, foreign aid efforts, <b>economic</b> <b>sanctioning</b> behavior, and interstate conflict onset, using a multi-faceted definition of neoliberalism. By using this definition to create proxies, I provide a more comprehensive analysis of the effect of neoliberalism on behaviors. Further, this definition allows me to include individual level factors capture the effect of leadership on foreign policy behaviors. In three empirical chapters, I examine the effect of neoliberalism on behavior and generally find results matching my expectations...|$|R
5|$|Gaddafi {{transformed}} Libya {{into a new}} socialist state {{called a}} Jamahiriya ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both {{the military and the}} Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing left it increasingly isolated on the international stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions.</b> From 1999, Gaddafi rejected Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and Pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009–10. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily {{on the side of the}} anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E

50|$|In November 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761, a {{non-binding}} resolution {{establishing the}} United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid {{and called for}} imposing <b>economic</b> and other <b>sanctions</b> on South Africa.

50|$|One {{probable}} type {{of action}} against South Africa was <b>economic</b> <b>sanction.</b> If UN affiliates broke fiscal and trading links with the country, {{it would make it}} all the trickier for the apartheid government to uphold itself and its policies. Such sanctions were argued frequently within the UN, and many recognised and backed it as an effectual and non-violent way of applying force, but South Africa's major trading partners once more voted against mandatory sanctions. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members split political, fiscal and transportation connections with South Africa. In 1968, it suggested the deferral of all cultural, didactic and sporting commerce as well. From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their dealings of armaments to South Africa. In spite of the many cries for sanctions, however, none were made obligatory, because South Africa's main trading partners were again primarily concerned for their own financial security.|$|R
