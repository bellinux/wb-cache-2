Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring.

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior {{in order to preserve}} self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E

500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E

He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to [...] "get out," [...] shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform {{at the front of the}} classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E

30|$|Instructors asking {{students}} {{to share their}} thoughts in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>class</b> without them volunteering {{to do so is}} a popular form of formative assessment and has been suggested as an evidence-based active-learning strategy to increase student participation in class (Dallimore et al. 2013) and student learning (Eddy et al. 2015 b). There are two common ways that this is done: cold call and random call. Cold call is when instructors either call students by name or point to {{students to}} answer a question when the student has not volunteered to answer the question. Random call is a form of cold call, where an instructor randomly calls on students to answer a question in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>class,</b> using a randomly generated list of student names.|$|R
500|$|The {{success of}} 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked {{a turning point}} in his career. The {{screenplay}} originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the [...] "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it [...] "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought [...] "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" [...] to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as [...] "dreamlike": [...] "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" [...] He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.|$|E

June credits Martha with raising her, which suggests that June may have been a motherless child. Though if this was so it is not said, when her mother died, as June tells a story of how she told a lie in school and her mother made her get up in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and admit she lied.

2500|$|Don Bosco records {{this from}} the {{testimony}} of Fr Giuseppe Cugliero. One day, {{in the absence of}} his teacher, two of Dominic's classmates stuffed the room-heating iron stove with snow and rubbish as a prank. Fearing expulsion, they blamed Dominic. Fr. Cugliero soundly berated Dominic in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and Dominic bore this silently. [...] The following day, the true culprits were discovered. On being asked why he had remained silent, Dominic replied that he had thought that he would be let off with a scolding whereas the other boys might have been expelled. Dominic added that Jesus had remained silent when blamed unjustly and {{that he was trying to}} imitate him. Mary Reed Newland, in her book, suggests that, since Dominic was yet to meet John Bosco, this incident is indicative of the upbringing his parents had given him.|$|E

2500|$|His father {{remarried}} {{and moved}} to the West Bronx, where Garfield joined a series of gangs. Much later, he would recall: [...] "Every street had its own gang. That's the way it was in poor sections... the old safety in numbers." [...] He soon became a gang leader. At this time, people started to notice his ability to mimic well-known performers, both physically and facially. He also began to hang out and eventually spar at a boxing gym on Jerome Avenue. At some point, he contracted scarlet fever (it was diagnosed later in adulthood), causing permanent damage to his heart and causing him to miss a lot of school. After being expelled three times and expressing a wish to quit school altogether, his father and step-mother sent him to P.S. 45, a school for difficult children. It was under the guidance of the school's principal—the noted educator Angelo Patri—that he was introduced to acting. Noticing Garfield's tendency to stammer, Patri assigned him to a speech therapy class taught by a charismatic teacher named Margaret O'Ryan. She gave him acting exercises and made him memorize and deliver speeches in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and, as he progressed, in front of school assemblies. O'Ryan thought he had natural talent and cast him in school plays. She encouraged him to sign up for a citywide debating competition sponsored by the New York Times. To his own surprise, he took second prize.|$|E

2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are not going to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E

The class, freed from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this still life without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw, then my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard to be copied instead.
