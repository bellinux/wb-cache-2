40|$|This review {{describes}} {{our use of}} the Dor {{operation in}} the management of 22 patients with achalasia of the cardia over the period 1970 to 1989. There was a male to female ratio of 1. 8 : 1. All presented with dysphagia of varying degree, with regurgitation (86 %), weight loss (73 %), pain (59 %) and chest infections (14 %) being associated symptoms. Two patients had undergone previous balloon dilatation, with temporary benefit. The morbidity was low and follow-up results were good in 94 % of cases. None of the patients had symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the postoperative period. In our experience, the Dor modification of the <b>Heller</b> <b>operation</b> has yielded gratifying results...|$|E
40|$|Childhood {{achalasia}} is {{an uncommon}} condition characterised {{by the absence}} of oesophageal peristalsis together with increased resting pressure and failure of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The currently accepted management is a modified Heller's cardiomyotomy with Nissen fundoplication; however, the long-term results are uncertain. A retrospective review of the notes of 10 children undergoing surgical treatment of achalasia at our institution over a 23 -year period were reviewed. There were six boys and four girls. The median age at onset of symptoms was 123 months and at diagnosis was 133 months. Five children were below average weight at the time of presentation. All underwent a modified <b>Heller's</b> <b>operation</b> and Nissen fundoplication. The follow-up ranged from 12 to 277 months with a mean of nearly 10 years. The results were excellent in terms of symptomatic improvement in eight of ten with one good and one moderate outcome. All children below average weight have shown improvement postoperatively. We would conclude that the management of achalasia in childhood should consist of an extended Heller's cardiomyotomy performed by the abdominal approach with the addition of an antireflux procedure such as Nissen fundoplication...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE The Da Vinci {{robotic surgery}} system offers {{particular}} advantages {{and is currently}} a frontier study {{in the field of}} minimally invasive surgery. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our experience in robotic surgical system in pediatric surgery as a tertiary referral center. We hope this pilot study can offer some recommendation for future development. METHODS Since 2007 to 2012, a total of 20 robotic-assisted operations(F: 10;M: 10) have been performed. The average age of the patient was 10. 7 y(ranged from 3 to 18 y). The operations included 9 cases of fundoplication (one of them also underwent robotic assisted <b>Heller’s</b> <b>operation</b> for achalasia at the same time), 5 cases of pyeloplasty, 2 cases of excision of choledochal cyst, 2 cases of partial esophagectomy, 1 case of ureteric reimplantation, and 1 case of Mitrofanoff procedure. RESULTS The mean operation time of fundoplication and pyeloplasty were respectively 220. 1 and 204. 2 minutes. 0 ne patient who underwent choledochal cyst excision was converted to open surgery due to difficult dissection. Disease recurrence was noted in one patient with partial esophagectomy for congenital esophageal stenosis due to tracheo-esophageal remnant. CONCLUSION The Da Vinci robotic sugical system is a reliable and effective approach for pediatric surgery. Long-term follow-up study is needed for further evaluation of its efficacy. 目的達芬奇機器人手術系統具有獨特的優勢,是當前微創外科手術的前沿領域。本文通過回顧分析和總結我中心在機器人輔助下完成小兒外科手術資料,為今后深入開展機器人小兒外科手術提供經驗和參考。方法 2007 ～ 2012 年,我中心累積采用機器人輔助完成小兒外科手術 20 例(男女各 10 例;平均年齡 10. 7 歲) 。手術包括 9 例胃底折疊術、 5 例腎盂成形術、 2 例膽總管囊腫切除術、 2 例食管部分切除術、 1 例輸尿管膀胱再植術和 1 例可控性尿流改道術。結果 9 例胃底折疊平均手術時間為 220. 1 min, 5 例腎盂成形平均手術時間為 204. 2 min。 1 例膽總管囊腫術中因組織分離困難而中轉開腹。 1 例先天性食管狹窄伴食管氣管瘺行食管部分切除術后 2 周復發,經二次手術治愈。結論機器人手術是小兒微創外科治療的有效手段。仍需對患兒長期隨訪,以進一步評估機器人手術的遠期效果...|$|R
40|$|Background: Albeit rare in children, {{achalasia}} is {{a disorder}} with severe symptoms that causes growth impairment. The {{treatment of choice}} in children is the esophagomyotomy, although there are variations in the surgical approaches available and differences of opinion regarding the inclusion of an adjunctive antireflux procedure. The recent advent of the laparoscopic approach has {{had a profound impact}} on the treatment of achalasia in both adults and children. Methods: In this report, we describe eight patients with severe achalasia who were treated by laparoscopic <b>Heller’s</b> <b>operation</b> associated with a fundoplication according to either Dor’s or Toupet’s technique. The patients’ ages ranged between 2 and 13 years. A five-port technique was used: a 10 -mm port placed infraumbilically for the optics and four 5 -mm ports. One was placed in the right abdominal quadrant for retraction of the left hepatic lobe, one in the left abdominal quadrant for the first operative instrument, one below the xyphoid appendix for the second operative instrument, and the last one to introduce a 5 -mm cannula laterally to the umbilicus to retract the stomach below. A 7 – 8 -cm laparoscopic Heller esophagomyotomy was completed, followed by an anterior Dor fundoplication in six cases and a Toupet in two. The longitudinal division of the anterior esophageal musculature was performed with a scalpel or scissors. The myotomy was made along the stomach, extending for 2 – 3 cm. Results: Mean operating time was 120 mins. Three complications were recorded. There were two perforations of the gastroesophageal mucosa; the first was sutured in laparoscopy and the second required a second operation. The third complication was a case of dysphagia resolved by dismounting a fundoplication that was too tight. At follow-up, which lasted from 6 months to 5 years, the children were all free of symptoms. Conclusions: Laparoscopic Heller esophagomyotomy appears to be a complex and difficult operation, but it is as safe and effective as laparotomy in children with achalasia. However, complications can be numerous and severe at the beginning of a surgeon’s experience...|$|R
50|$|To give gamers {{more power}} in the game, the {{developers}} have added tendrils. Tendrils sprout from Heller's arm {{and can be used}} for a variety of purposes. Players can use tendrils to smash objects into other objects, such as a car into a tank, utilising the 'Black Hole' attack. Players will be able to dismember enemies, a force that will become more useful as the game progresses. There are many more ways to kill enemies, ranging from throwing a car at a group of Blackwatch soldiers, hacking off a mutant's head or using powers. Consuming has not changed since the original Prototype, with the exception of some enemies, which are consumed upon grabbing them (e.g. Supersoldiers, Brawlers). It has also been announced that Heller can now control a pack of Brawlers (similar to Prototypes Hunters) to attack anything he desires (note: this power is limited to main variant of Brawler). Heller will no longer find 'Events' throughout NYZ, instead starting side-missions by hacking into Blacknet. Blackwatch's system that details military operations and the three areas of NYZ, Heller chooses from a small list of missions at each terminal. Blacknet will allow <b>Heller</b> to find <b>operations</b> that he can disrupt or take control of for his own purposes and find important people that will allow him to learn more about what he has become because of the Blacklight virus. It will also help him find out more about Alex Mercer and what his connections are to his family's deaths. The missions that are selectable can be sidequests or extensions to the main quest that tell Heller more about the Blacklight virus.|$|R
