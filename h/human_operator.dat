5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E

For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a <b>human</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote <b>human</b> <b>operator.</b> Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Networks of {{different}} types are essential infrastructures for society. Networks such as transportation networks and the electric power grid are becoming increasingly large and complex which create special challenges for <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> who must monitor these networks for safe operation. It {{is important to understand}} how <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> monitor these networks and the challenges they face in the monitoring task. In order to do this, we conducted a survey of how <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> monitor various networks—water distribution networks, electric power grid, air traffic control, and nuclear power plant networks. From our survey in these specific extensively-studied networks, we are able to generalize the challenges of operators monitoring networks. The hope is that these results will provide human factors engineers with a better understanding so they can cater {{to the needs of the}} <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> when designing new interfaces for network monitoring tasks...|$|R

25|$|Positioning by Cartesian {{coordinates}} may be done {{by entering}} the coordinates into the system or by using a teach pendant which moves the robot in X-Y-Z directions. It is much easier for a <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> to visualize motions up/down, left/right, etc. than to move each joint one at a time. When the desired position is reached it is then defined in some way particular to the robot software in use, e.g. P1 - P5 below.|$|E
25|$|By this point, {{reception}} {{had been}} automated, but {{the speed and}} accuracy of the transmission were still limited to the skill of the <b>human</b> <b>operator.</b> The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in Morse code) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.|$|E
25|$|All {{the rail}} lines have an {{ultimate}} nexus at the Five Points station, located in downtown Atlanta. MARTA trains are operated using the Automatic Train Control system, with one <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> per train to make announcements, operate doors, and {{to operate the}} trains manually {{in case of a}} control system malfunction or an emergency. Many of the suburban stations have free daily and paid long-term parking in park and ride lots. These stations also have designated kiss and ride passenger drop-off areas close to the stations' entrances.|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{economies of}} scale for UAV {{operations}} inevitably requires the operation of many UAVs by few <b>human</b> <b>operators,</b> whether it is for time-critical tasks such as search and rescue or postal delivery involving fleets of UAVs. Although it is technically possible to operate many UAVs with one operator, operation of multiple UAVs conducting beneficial tasks in a civilian airspace environment requires consideration of the associated risks. This paper {{is concerned with the}} question of how can the reliability of multi-UAV operations with <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> be analysed for assessing safety? This paper takes the view that a UAV team with <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> can be considered like any other system and analysed using functional safety principles.

25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would be there to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E
25|$|Active use of {{automated}} lights {{suggests that}} the luminaire is used to perform tasks which would otherwise require human involvement, or be simply impossible with conventional fixtures. For instance, a number of moving heads producing tightly focused, pure white beams straight down onto the stage will produce a fantastic effect reminiscent of searchlights from a helicopter (especially if a smoke machine or hazer is {{used to make the}} beams visible). To recreate such an effect without intelligent lights would require at least one <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> seated directly above the stage with a followspot, which would generally be considered to be too expensive for such a small effect.|$|E
25|$|Ergonomic {{simulation}} {{involves the}} analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.|$|E

25|$|Type 76A twin 37mm gun {{was thus}} {{developed}} {{to solve these}} problems by introducing an enclosed turret and fire control systems. A fire control radar guides these weapons, and can engage targets in most conditions. There is also an optronic device that enables manual and optical aiming. The Type 76F is a Type 76A system with simplified fire control system, which has the electrooptic system but not the radar. Also, there is a console for one <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> inside the gun mount for local manual control, though the gun can be fully automated. Unlike the old manual mounts that require a full crew of men to steer, aim, load, and fire the weapon, the Type 76F requires only one operator to aim the system. In addition to the 37mm guns, a number of Russian AK-230 were also purchased and reverse engineered (as Type 69) for small boats.|$|E
25|$|Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices {{remotely}} operated {{from a distance}} by a <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They {{can also be used}} to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely. Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets. Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's Packbot and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual camera shots leaving the <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots, the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested camera shots that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to look at one another across cuts, and favors those shots which the <b>human</b> <b>operator</b> had previously used in sequence.|$|E
40|$|Most {{unmanned}} {{missions in}} space and undersea are commanded by a “script ” that specifies a sequence of discrete commands and continuous actions.

The observations are converted into a probabilistic representation suitable for fusion with the system 2 ̆ 7 s belief. The conversion is performed by a Human Sensor Model (HSM). The initial HSM is built offline based on an average of multiple human subjects conducting a calibration experiment. Since individual <b>human</b> <b>operators</b> may vary in their performance an online adaptation of the HSM is required. The network estimate is used for adaptation because the true feature state is unknown at runtime. Results of an outdoor calibration experiment using range and bearing observations are presented.
