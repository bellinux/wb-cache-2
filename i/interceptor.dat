Both units flew the F-106. It also assumed command of the 107th Fighter <b>Interceptor</b> Group at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the 147th Fighter <b>Interceptor</b> Group at Ellington Field, Texas.

5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An <b>interceptor</b> flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The <b>interceptor</b> could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an <b>interceptor</b> with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, <b>interceptor,</b> and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the <b>interceptor</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and the Hunter was the nation's primary and most capable <b>interceptor.</b> During the conflict, the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air. India's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India. In 1962, India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the <b>interceptor</b> role by 1970.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interceptors</b> are a mean to add {{specific}} network-oriented capabilities (such as authentication, flow control, caching etc.) to a {{distributed application}} which runs over a middleware without changing either the application code or the middleware's one.

40|$|<b>Interceptors</b> are an {{emerging}} middleware technology enabling {{the addition of}} specific network-oriented capabilities to distributed applications. By exploiting <b>interceptors,</b> developers can register code within interception points, extending the basic middleware mechanisms with specific functionality, e. g. authentication, flow control, caching, etc. Notably, these extensions can be achieved without modifying either the application or the middleware code. In this paper we report {{the results of our}} experiences with CORBA request portable <b>interceptors.</b> In particular, we point out (i) the basic mechanisms implementable by these <b>interceptors,</b> i. e. request redirection and piggybacking and (ii) we analyze their limitations. We then propose a proxy-based technique to overcome the interceptors' limitations. Successively, we present a performance analysis carried out on three Java-CORBA platforms currently implementing the portable <b>interceptors</b> specification. Finally, we conclude our work with a case study in which portable <b>interceptors</b> are used to implement the fault-tolerant CORBA client invocation semantic without impacting on the client application code and on the CORBA ORB. We also release fragments of Java code for implementing the described techniques. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

50|$|To provide {{challenges}} for <b>interceptors,</b> The B-57Es towed styroforam, bomb-shaped radar reflectant targets. These could be towed at higher altitudes than the high-drag 45' banners but hits {{could still be}} scored on them. By 1960, the rocket firing <b>interceptors</b> were giving way to F-102 Delta Dagger <b>interceptors</b> firing heat-seeking AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles. This made the target towing mission of the B-57E obsolete, and the B-57Es were adapted to electronic countermeasures and faker target aircraft (EB-57E) (see below).|$|R
5|$|The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an <b>interceptor</b> {{variant of}} the Tornado, {{developed}} for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, {{but it was not}} intended as a dog-fighter, instead it was a long-endurance <b>interceptor</b> to counter the threat from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers chose St. Vincent {{as their}} primary {{shooting}} location, as it contained the quietest beach they could find, and built three piers and a backlot for Port Royal and Tortuga. Of most importance to the film were the three ships: the Black Pearl, the Dauntless, and the <b>Interceptor.</b> For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the Black Pearl and the <b>Interceptor.</b> The Dauntless and the Black Pearl were built on barges, with computer-generated imagery finishing the structures. The Black Pearl was also built on the Spruce Goose stage, {{in order to control}} fog and lighting. The <b>Interceptor</b> was a re-dressed Lady Washington, a full-scale replica sailing ship from Aberdeen, Washington, fully repainted before going on a 40-day voyage beginning December 2, 2002, arriving on location on January 12, 2003.
