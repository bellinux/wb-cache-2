40|$|Abstract—Open source {{software}} (OSS) development teams use electronic means, such as emails, instant messaging, or forums, {{to conduct}} open and public discussions. Researchers investigated mailing lists considering {{them as a}} hub for project communica-tion. Prior work focused on specific aspects of emails, for example the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>patches,</b> traceability concerns, or social networks. This led to insights pertaining to the investigated aspects, but not to a comprehensive view of what developers communicate about. Our objective {{is to increase the}} understanding of development mailing lists communication. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed a sample of 506 email threads from the development mailing list of a major OSS project, Lucene. Our investigation reveals that implementation details are discussed only in about 35 % of the threads, and that a range of other topics is discussed. Moreover, core developers participate in less than 75 % of the threads. We observed that the development mailing list is not the main player in OSS project communication, as it also includes other channels such as the issue repository. I...|$|E

5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to his <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the Black <b>Patch</b> Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|R

In {{contrast}} to Beckham's inaction, Willson immediately deployed the state militia and declared martial law in twenty western (and predominantly Democratic) counties. While the troops were helpful, there were never {{more than three hundred}} deployed, and they were not a major factor in ending the violence. Hostile Democrats in the General Assembly formed an investigative committee that found Willson guilty of violating the state's constitution by calling out the militia without a formal request by civil authorities. Willson also sent spies to infiltrate the [...] "Night Riders" [...] an organization of vigilantes who perpetrated much of the violence [...] and determine which local officials supported them. He publicly announced he would pardon anyone who killed a Night Rider. This decision was hailed by some newspapers as an effective deterrent, while others criticized it as encouraging more lawlessness.|$|R

40|$|Chloride {{contamination}} in reinforced concrete {{leads to the}} corrosion of steel bars. Concrete patch repairs are widely practiced as a remedial measure for the mitigation of such corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. The performance <b>of</b> the <b>patch</b> repairs was studied by various researchers in the past. The structural and material aspects <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> repairs have received more attention than the electrochemical consequences <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> repairs in past studies. But electrochemical changes could be the underlying cause for the failure <b>of</b> many <b>patch</b> repairs. This paper reviews the performance <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> repairs from a durability point of view. It covers the formation of incipient anodes, which are the new corrosion sites formed after a patch repair process. The prevailing corrosion mechanism at the incipient anodes is discussed. The performance <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> repairs when modified with corrosion inhibitors and sacrificial anodes is examined. The importance of the selection of repair materials from a durability point is highlighted considering the electrochemical consequences <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> repair...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{landscape}} parameters influencing {{species richness}} <b>of</b> habitat <b>patches</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most important}} issues in conservation biology. Many previous studies have investigated the influence of habitat parameters on bird assemblages in forest patches, but studies seeking effects of oasis parameters on bird assemblages are very scarce. Karkas Protected Area is located in semi-arid zone in   the central Iran, comprising a number <b>of</b> woodland <b>patches</b> supporting different groups of birds. We studied the influence <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> size and shape on bird species richness and diversity <b>of</b> woodland <b>patches</b> in Karakas Protected Area. Bird census was conducted in spring and summer 2007 within 15 woodland patches using established line transects (TL = 17. 1 km). Rarefied species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were respectively used as measures of species richness and diversity. Patch parameters (area and circumference) were quantified using satellite images. Linear regression analysis revealed positive effect <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> area and negative effect <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> shape (the ratio <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> perimeter to patch area) on bird species richness and diversity. These results can be applied in management programs for biodiversity conservation, in particular, for maintaining bird species diversity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{having a}} {{positive}} patch test reaction to para-phenylenediamine (PPD), some patients continue to dye their hair, {{while others are}} forced to give up or abandon this practice. This difference in patient behaviour {{could be due to}} the degree of sensitization. Objectives: To establish whether the ability to continue dyeing hair in PPD allergic patients is related to the strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction. To note differences in other clinical features in relation to the strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction. Methods We analysed retrospectively the <b>patch</b> test records <b>of</b> 400 sequential PPD-positive patients for the strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction (+, ++, +++) and different clinical features. Data were analysed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel χ 2 tests. Results: There was a strong linear relationship between the strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction and continuation with hair dyeing. Patients {{were more likely to report}} a history of hair dye reaction with increasing strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction. There was no difference in strength <b>of</b> <b>patch</b> test reaction in relation to age, site of rash, occupation (hairdressing) or history of atopic eczema. Overall concomitant reactivity with related aromatic amine allergens (benzocaine, N-isopropyl-N-phenyl-para-phenylenediamine, para-aminobenzoic acid) was infrequent. Conclusions: Patients with stronger patch test reactions (++, +++) are more likely to have a clear history of reacting to hair dye and are less likely to still be dyeing their hair. © 2005 British Association of Dermatologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
