60|$|The {{schooner}} {{seemed to}} be straying promiscuously through the smother, her <b>head-sail</b> banging wildly. The men waited {{and looked at the}} boys, who began fishing.|$|E
60|$|Joe obeyed, and, the <b>head-sail</b> filling, {{forced her}} {{off on the}} other tack. This {{manoeuver}} had turned French Pete's bunk from the lee to the weather side, and rolled him out on the cabin floor, where he lay in a drunken stupor.|$|E
60|$|Compressing {{his lips}} {{like a man}} resolved, the {{commander}} of the Coquette bent further forward, and glanced at the wheel. The quarter-master, who held the spokes, was erect, steady, and kept his eye on the leech of the <b>head-sail,</b> as unerringly as the needle points to the pole.|$|E
60|$|The Uncle Toby swung to her chain, <b>head-sails</b> ran down, and the Kanaka crew {{sprang to}} fore and main-halyards and sheets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you dislike it, Sir Gervaise?--Now to our fancies aboard here, {{it gives}} the Achilles a knowing look, {{and we hope to}} set a fashion. By {{carrying}} the <b>head-sails</b> well forward, we help the ship round in a sea, you know, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mr. Van Weyden, {{stand by}} {{to pass the}} <b>head-sails</b> over. Then jump for the topsails and spread them quick as God’ll let you—the quicker you do it the easier you’ll find it. As for Cooky, if he isn’t lively bat him between the eyes.” ...|$|R
60|$|It was too true. The Rose, unmanageable {{from the}} loss of her <b>head-sail,</b> lay {{at the mercy of the}} Spaniard; and the archers and musqueteers had hardly time to range {{themselves}} to leeward, when the Madre Dolorosa's chains were grinding against the Rose's, and grapples tossed on board from stem to stern.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{has been}} a good morning's work," [...] the captain said, as they sat down to dinner. [...] "We are a little short of <b>head-sail,</b> but that will make no great {{difference}} in our rate of sailing, especially if the wind is aft. We are ready to meet with another storm again, if it should come--which is not likely.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{sufficiently}} plain. She is too lean in the harping, and too {{full in the}} counter, to steer. Then, she in as wall-sided as a church, and stows too much above the water-line. Besides this, she carries no <b>head-sail,</b> but all the press upon her will be aft, which will jam her into the wind, and, more than likely, throw her aback. The day will come when that ship will go down stern foremost." ...|$|E
6000|$|The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round {{pieces of}} coal, and the Gloucester men shouted {{messages}} {{to their wives}} and womenfolk and owners, while the [...] "We're Here" [...] finished the musical ride through the Fleet, her <b>head-sails</b> quivering like a man's hand when he raises it to say good-bye.|$|R
50|$|A sloop (from Dutch sloep, in {{turn from}} French chaloupe) is a sailing boat {{with a single}} mast and a fore-and-aft rig. A sloop has only one head-sail: if a vessel has two or more <b>head-sails,</b> the term 'cutter' is used, and its mast may be set further aft than on a sloop.|$|R
50|$|The Emma C. Berry {{was built}} in 1865 by John Latham in the R. & J. Palmer Shipyard in Noank, Connecticut for John Henry Berry. The ship was named after his {{daughter}} and constructed {{in a similar way}} to other Noank smacks. The ship was launched in 1866 with a sloop rig and two <b>head-sails.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Crawl {{forward and}} try and fix the floor-board there, so as to show a few inches above the bow {{to act as a}} <b>head-sail.</b> If she broaches to, it is all up with us. As you go along tell each man to shift himself a bit more aft. Her stern must be well down or I can never keep her straight. If you can’t fix the floor-board, get up the mast; tie up the {{foresail}} in a roll, and then hoist it, that will give hold enough to the wind.” ...|$|E
60|$|It {{came next}} into our {{consideration}} {{what we should}} do with their ship; but this was not long resolving; for there were but two ways, either to set her on fire, or to run her on shore, and we chose the last. So we set her foresail with the tack at the cat-head, and lashed her helm a little to starboard, to answer her <b>head-sail,</b> and so set her agoing, with neither cat or dog in her; and it was not above two hours before we saw her run right ashore upon the coast, a little beyond the Cape Comorin; and away we went round about Ceylon, for the coast of Coromandel.|$|E
6000|$|... "All I now ask, my dear young lady," [...] {{he said to}} Eve, who ventured on deck {{to look at the}} desolation, as {{soon the}} wreck was cut adrift, [...] "all I now ask, my dear young lady, is an end to {{westerly}} winds for two or three weeks, and I will promise to place you all in America yet, in time to eat your Christmas dinner. I do not think Sir George will shoot many white bears among the Rocky Mountains this year, but then there will be so many more left for another season. The ship is in a category, and he will be an impudent scoundrel who denies it; but worse categories than this have been reasoned out of countenance. All <b>head-sail</b> is not a convenient show of cloth to claw off a lee-shore with; but I still hope to escape the misfortune of laying eyes on the coast of Africa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The wind is {{northing}} a bit," [...] {{the skipper}} said as, after giving the helmsman instructions, {{he came up}} to Frank. [...] "It has shifted two points round in the last half hour, and you see we have got the boom off a bit. If it goes round a point more we will get the square-sail ready for hoisting. It will help her along rarely when the <b>head-sails</b> cease to be of any good." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{seized the}} chain, and a sharp, musical rattle rang out as it ran below, for the hollow hull flung back the {{metallic}} clinking like a sounding-board. When the cable was short-up, they grasped the halyards {{and the big}} gaff-mainsail rose flapping up the mast. They set it {{and turned to the}} <b>head-sails,</b> for though, strictly speaking, a sloop carries only one, the term is loosely applied in places, and as Vane had changed her rig, there were two of them to be hoisted.|$|R
60|$|She was a brig, but her {{mainmast}} {{had been}} snapped short off some ten {{feet above the}} deck, and no effort {{seemed to have been}} made to cut away the wreckage, which floated, sails and yards, like the broken wing of a wounded gull, upon the water beside her. The foremast was still standing, but the fore-topsail was flying loose, and the <b>head-sails</b> were streaming out in long white pennons in front of her. Never have I seen a vessel which appeared to have gone through rougher handling.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} {{of getting the}} anchors occupied a considerable time, for Maso refused, now there existed no necessity for the sacrifice, to permit a yarn to be cut; but, released from this hold on the water, the bark whirled away, and was soon driving before the wind. The mariner was at the helm, and, causing the <b>head-sail</b> to be loosened, he steered directly for the rocks of Savoy. This manoeuvre excited disagreeable suspicions {{in the minds of}} several on board, for the lawless character of their pilot had been more than suspected {{in the course of their}} short acquaintance, and the coast towards which they were furiously rushing known to be iron-bound, and, in such a gale fatal to all who came rudely upon its rocks. Half-an-hour removed their apprehensions. When near enough to the mountains to feel their deadening influence on the gale, the natural effect of the eddies, formed by their resistance to the currents, he luffed-to and set his main-sail. Relieved by this wise precaution, the Winkelried now wore her canvass gallantly, and she dashed along the shore of Savoy with a foaming beak, shooting past ravine, valley, glen, and hamlet, as if sailing in air.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} rig of modern sailboats is the Bermuda-rigged sloop. Typically, a modern sloop carries a {{mainsail}} on a boom aft of the mast, {{with a single}} loose-footed <b>head-sail</b> (a jib or a genoa jib) forward of the mast.|$|E
60|$|Amidships the Pyrenees {{was an open}} flaming furnace, out {{of which}} poured an immense volume of smoke which rose high above the masts and {{completely}} hid the forward part of the ship. McCoy, in {{the shelter of the}} mizzen-shrouds, continued his difficult task of conning the ship through the intricate channel. The fire was working aft along the deck from the seat of explosion, while the soaring tower of canvas on the mainmast went up and vanished in a sheet of flame. Forward, though they could not see them, they knew that the <b>head-sails</b> were still drawing.|$|R
60|$|Once {{inside the}} lagoon, the Arangi filled {{away with the}} wind a-beam. At {{the end of a}} swift half-mile she rounded to, with <b>head-sails</b> {{trimming}} down and with a great flapping of main and mizzen, and dropped anchor in fifty feet of water so clear that every huge fluted clamshell was visible on the coral floor. The whaleboat was not necessary to put the Langa- Langa return boys ashore. Hundreds of canoes lay twenty deep along both sides of the Arangi, and each boy, with his box and bell, was clamoured for by scores of relatives and friends.|$|R
60|$|But {{she was not}} tacking. She came rapidly {{on before}} a stiff west wind. There was no need of getting out boats to go to meet her. She was south of the headland, but was {{steering}} directly toward it. They could see what sort of craft she was--a long schooner, painted green, with all sails set. Very soon {{they could see the}} heads of the men on board. Then she came nearer and nearer to land, until she was less than half a mile from shore. Then she shot into the wind; her sails fluttered; she lay almost motionless, and her <b>head-sails</b> were lowered.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mulford, {{who knew}} how hopeless was the attempt to mystify Rose, as one might mystify her credulous and weak-minded aunt, and who had no {{disposition}} to deal any way but fairly by the beautiful, and in one sense now helpless young creature before him, did not see fit to make any reply. Offend Spike he did not dare to do, more especially under present circumstances; and mislead Rose he would not do. He affected not to hear the question, therefore, but issuing an order about the <b>head-sails,</b> he walked forward as if to see it executed. Rose herself was not under as much restraint as the young mate.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a famous}} shot, and his iron nerves never failed him in an emergency. The dark head {{appearing}} {{on the crest of}} a roller, and then swooping down on the other side, was already half-way to the sloop. Sharkey dwelt long upon his aim before he fired. With the crack of the gun the swimmer reared himself up in the water, waved his hands in a gesture of warning, and roared out in a voice which rang over the bay. Then, as the sloop swung round her <b>head-sails,</b> and the pirate fired an impotent broadside, Stephen Craddock, smiling grimly in his death agony, sank slowly down to that golden couch which glimmered far beneath him.|$|R
60|$|The Sorata came {{straight}} on toward them, close-hauled on the wind, {{until they could}} hear the hissing of the brine that swept a foot deep along her slanted deck; then there was a banging of canvas, and she swung as on a pivot, while a bent figure with its back against her tiller became furiously busy. Slanting sharply, she drove away on the other tack, and shot in with canvas shaking between a great four-masted ship and a steamer with white tiers of decks. Then her <b>head-sails</b> dropped, and she stopped with a big iron buoy which Valentine seized with his boat-hook close beneath her bowsprit. After that there was a rattle of chain, and Prescott made a gesture of approval.|$|R
60|$|When the Coquette had tacked, {{the calm}} and observant Skimmer was {{satisfied}} with throwing his <b>head-sails</b> flat to the mast. From that instant, the brigantine lay floating in the current, neither advancing nor receding a foot, and always keeping her position {{at a safe distance}} from the ship, that was so adroitly made to answer the purposes of a beacon. The sails were watched with the closest care; and so nicely was the delicate machine tended, that it would have been, at any moment, in her people's power to have lessened her way, by turning to the stream. The Coquette was followed till she anchored, and the call on board the cruiser to heave the grapnels had been given, because the brigantine was apparently floating directly down on her broadside.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice of}} the pilot, however, was still heard, steady and calm, and yet so clear and high as to reach every ear; and the obedient seamen whirled the yards at his bidding in despite of the tempest, as if they handled the toys of their childhood. When the ship had fallen off dead before the wind, her <b>head-sails</b> were shaken, her after-yards trimmed, and her helm shifted, before she had time to run upon the danger that had threatened, as well to leeward as to windward. The {{beautiful}} fabric, obedient to her government, threw her bows up gracefully towards the wind again; and, as her sails were trimmed, moved out from among the dangerous shoals, {{in which she had}} been embayed, as steadily and swiftly as she had approached them.|$|R
60|$|The Kanaka {{helmsman}} put {{the wheel}} down, and the Malahini {{slipped into the}} eye of the wind and righted to an even keel. Her <b>head-sails</b> emptied, there was a rat-tat of reef-points and quick shifting of boom-tackles, and she was heeled over and filled away on the other tack. Though it was early morning and the wind brisk, the five white men who lounged on the poop-deck were scantily clad. David Grief, and his guest, Gregory Mulhall, an Englishman, were still in pajamas, their naked feet thrust into Chinese slippers. The captain and mate were in thin undershirts and unstarched duck pants, while the supercargo still held in his hands the undershirt he was reluctant to put on. The sweat stood out on his forehead, and he seemed to thrust his bare chest thirstily into the wind that did not cool.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{would not}} mind running the risk either, captain, if I saw any {{probability}} of success, but I own that this seems an impossibility. However, {{it may be}} that sometimes a small party comes alone, and that we could get possession of a canoe of manageable size. At any rate, we may as well prepare for such a chance before setting to work to build. We have plenty of canvas from the fore-topgallant sail and <b>head-sails</b> of the brig, and can make a couple of lug-sails fit for a large canoe and a couple for a smaller one, and get the spars ready; that would not take us a great deal of time, and if a bit of luck does fall in our way we should be ready to avail ourselves of it. That fellow has swam ashore now, so we had better be going back to the hut.” ...|$|R
60|$|Already the <b>head-sails</b> and the main-sail {{had been}} raised, while a hundred willing hands poled her {{off from the}} wharf. Now the wind caught her; heeling over, and quivering with eagerness like an {{unleashed}} hound she flew through the opening {{and out into the}} Channel. She was a famous little schooner, the Marie Rose of Winchelsea, and under her daring owner Cock Badding, half trader and half pirate, had brought back into port many a rich cargo taken in mid-Channel, and paid for in blood rather than money. Small as she was, her great speed and the fierce character of her master had made her a name of terror along the French coast, and many a bulky Eastlander or Fleming as he passed the narrow seas had scanned the distant Kentish shore, fearing lest that ill-omened purple sail with a gold Christopher upon it should shoot out suddenly from the dim gray cliffs. Now she was clear of the land, with the wind on her larboard quarter, every inch of canvas set, and her high sharp bows smothered in foam, as she dug through the waves.|$|R
60|$|And I {{was indeed}} thankful, for I had {{by this time}} learned enough to know, with all our canvas spread, what {{disaster}} in such event awaited us. The whispers of wind became puffs, the sails filled, the Ghost moved. Wolf Larsen put the wheel hard up, to port, and we began to pay off. The wind was now dead astern, muttering and puffing stronger and stronger, and my <b>head-sails</b> were pounding lustily. I did not see what went on elsewhere, though I felt the sudden surge and heel of the schooner as the wind-pressures changed to the jibing of the fore- and main-sails. My hands were full with the flying-jib, jib, and staysail; {{and by the time}} this part of my task was accomplished the Ghost was leaping into the south-west, the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard. Without pausing for breath, though my heart was beating like a trip-hammer from my exertions, I sprang to the topsails, and before the wind had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling down. Then I went aft for orders.|$|R
60|$|But {{the splendid}} {{discipline}} of the British service was at its best in such a crisis. The boats flew back; their crews clustered aboard, they were swung up at the davits and the fall-ropes made fast. Hammocks were brought up and stowed, bulkheads sent down, ports and magazines opened, the fires put out in the galley, and the drums beat to quarters. Swarms of men set the <b>head-sails</b> and brought the frigate round, while the gun-crews threw off their jackets and shirts, tightened their belts, and ran out their eighteen-pounders, peering through the open portholes at the stately Frenchman. The wind was very light. Hardly a ripple showed itself upon the clear blue water, but the sails blew gently out as the breeze came over the wooded banks. The Frenchman had gone about also, and both ships were now heading slowly for the sea under fore-and-aft canvas, the Gloire a hundred yards in advance. She luffed up to cross the Leda's bows, but the British ship came round also, and the two rippled slowly on in such a silence that the ringing of ramrods as the French marines drove home their charges clanged quite loudly upon the ear.|$|R
6000|$|Twice {{she heard}} the splash of the lead, and listened intently for the cry that followed. Once a man's voice spoke, low, imperative, issuing an order, and she thrilled with the delight of it. It was only a {{direction}} to {{the man at the}} wheel to port his helm. She watched the slight altering of the course, and knew that it was for the purpose of enabling the flat-hauled sails to catch those first fans of the land breeze, and she waited for the same low voice to utter the one word [...] "Steady!" [...] And again she thrilled when it did utter it. Once more the lead splashed, and [...] "Eleven fadom" [...] was the resulting cry. [...] "Let go!" [...] the low voice came to her through the darkness, followed by the surging rumble of the anchor- chain. The clicking of the sheaves in the blocks as the sails ran down, <b>head-sails</b> first, was music to her; and she detected on the instant the jamming of a jib-downhaul, and almost saw the impatient jerk with which the sailor must have cleared it. Nor did she take interest in the two men beside her till both lights, red and green, came into view as the anchor checked the onward way.|$|R

6000|$|From {{first to}} last the seaman's {{thoughts}} {{are very much}} concerned with his anchors. It {{is not so much}} that the anchor is a symbol of hope as that it is the heaviest object that he has to handle on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of his duties. The beginning and the end of every passage are marked distinctly by work about the ship's anchors. A vessel in the Channel has her anchors always ready, her cables shackled on, and the land almost always in sight. The anchor and the land are indissolubly connected in a sailor's thoughts. But directly she is clear of the narrow seas, heading out into the world with nothing solid to speak of between her and the South Pole, the anchors are got in and the cables disappear from the deck. But the anchors do not disappear. Technically speaking, they are [...] "secured in-board"; and, on the forecastle head, lashed down to ring-bolts with ropes and chains, under the straining sheets of the <b>head-sails,</b> they look very idle and as if asleep. Thus bound, but carefully looked after, inert and powerful, those emblems of hope make company for the look-out man in the night watches; and so the days glide by, with a long rest for those characteristically shaped pieces of iron, reposing forward, visible from almost every part of the ship's deck, waiting for their work {{on the other side of}} the world somewhere, while the ship carries them on with a great rush and splutter of foam underneath, and the sprays of the open sea rust their heavy limbs.|$|R
