500|$|Politicians {{from both}} parties opined on the propriety of the Fund and on what Nixon should do, most in accord with their {{political}} affiliation. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, though, publicly reserved judgment, leading Chotiner to suspect [...] "that Stevenson is afraid of something here. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> he has something to hide." ...|$|E

500|$|News {{reporter}}s were {{very aware of}} the intense rescue efforts to bring Hambleton home. When the rescue team and Hambleton arrived at Dong Ha, a reporter commented to Norris, “It must have been tough out there. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you wouldn’t do that again.” Norris replied, “An American was down in enemy territory. Of course I’d do it again." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1941, Hitler {{wanted the}} convoys {{supplying}} the British Expeditionary force in Greece stopped, and the Italian Navy was the only force able to attempt this. Cunningham stated in his biography: [...] "I myself was inclined {{to think that the}} Italians would not try anything. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> Commander Power, the Staff Officer, Operations, the sum of ten shillings that we would see nothing of the enemy." [...] Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé {{continues}} to dismiss her former lover as she sings, [...] "So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...", over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums. She then chants the ascendant chorus, which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment. Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Beyoncé rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint; on the latter, she affirms {{that she has}} moved on in life. The song ends as Beyoncé repeatedly sings, [...] "What goes around comes back around / <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> it sucks to be you right now".|$|E

"Will <b>I?</b> You <b>bet!</b> <b>I</b> {{just thought}} maybe--Say, by golly, it does do a fellow good, don't it, {{to sit and}} visit about {{business}} conditions, after he's been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} his story? <b>I</b> will <b>bet</b> you sixpence"--and Mr. Dennant paused to swing his mallet with a proper {{accuracy}} [...] "that he's been in prison." ...|$|R
500|$|... is a Wii game {{developed}} by Ambrella and released via the WiiWare download service. First released on March 25, 2008, in Japan, {{it was later}} made available in North America on June 9, 2008, and in Europe on July 4, 2008, for 1000 Wii Points. Like the GameCube's , Ranch allows players to store and arrange Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl. Pokémon transferred from those games are rendered in 3D and can interact with the player's Miis. Although given positive reviews by parents and children, it was received very poorly by critics, who criticized it for its graphics, one responding [...] "I can't even tell what these things are! <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> the children can't either!".|$|E
500|$|In {{many places}} the film {{references}} classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey {{and he says}} [...] "I can fly" [...] and people around including the Three Little Pigs say [...] "He can fly, he can fly"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. This scene is also {{a reference to the}} Disney film Dumbo, where Donkey says, while flying, [...] "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you ain't never seen a Donkey fly" [...] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The transformation scene {{at the end of the}} film strongly references to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] is a doo-wop style pop shuffle {{song and}} opened the second side of Like a Prayer. It begins {{with the sound of}} synths and {{keyboard}} and Madonna repeatedly singing the words [...] "cherish, cherish". This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always having you here by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way <b>I</b> <b>bet,</b> So don't underestimate my point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> they put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

5000|$|Garrett also {{embarked}} on {{a career as a}} performer,. His debut album, Turbo 919, was released June 21, 2008 on his <b>Bet</b> <b>I</b> Penned It Music imprint, through Interscope Records. (Garrett's catch-phrase, which is featured in multiple songs he has produced, is [...] "Smash on the radio, <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> penned it".) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah, king!" [...] said Thorarin, [...] "there are {{few things}} one cannot match if one seek long and take pains. <b>I</b> would <b>bet,</b> with thy permission, King, {{to find an}} uglier." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later on, Imus {{commented on}} the President saying [...] "Go baby!" [...] while doing radio play-by-play at an Orioles game, and added, [...] "I {{remember}} commenting at the time, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> that's {{not the first time}} he's said that." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also created}} <b>I</b> <b>Bet</b> You Will for MTV. <b>I</b> <b>Bet</b> You Will {{began as a}} popular Internet webcast of five-minute episodes {{featuring}} ordinary people doing stunts in exchange for money. Examples include eating a full jar of mayonnaise ($235USD), eating a [...] "worm burrito" [...] ($265USD), and taking shots of corn oil, Pepto-Bismol, lemon juice, hot sauce, cold chicken broth, and cod liver oil (US$450.00 for all nine shots). The webcast was a success, with over a million hits {{in the first five}} days. MTV later bought and aired the show, which Spurlock hosted. [...] The list of documentary films that inspired Spurlock includes Brother's Keeper, Hoop Dreams, The Thin Blue Line, Roger and Me, Harlan County USA, and The Last Waltz. [...] He considers Brother's Keeper the greatest documentary of all time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Roth {{returned}} {{with an adult}} lounge act, performing largely in Las Vegas casinos, with a brass band that featured Nile Rodgers, Edgar Winter, {{and members of the}} Miami Sound Machine.

2500|$|In March 2007, {{during an}} {{interview}} on The Dan Patrick Show on ESPN Radio, Rose said, [...] "I bet on my team every night.

[...] "I did {{everything in my power}} every night to win that game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criminal {{profiler}} Pat Brown {{calls the}} serial killer theory [...] "ludicrous", {{arguing that the}} evidence does not fit {{what is known about}} serial killers. Brown also believes that the smiley face images found in some of the cases are likely nothing more than coincidences based upon making a guess at where the body entered the water and searching a wide area until an example of smiley face graffiti can be found. [...] "It's not an unusual symbol," [...] she told Matt Smith of the Minneapolis-based newspaper City Pages. [...] "If you look in any area five miles square, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you could find a smiley face." ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous English {{words have}} been {{borrowed}} and adapted {{for use in}} Pennsylvania German since the first generations of Pennsylvania German habitation of southeastern Pennsylvania. Examples of English loan words that are relatively common are [...] "bet" [...] (Ich bet, du kannscht Deitsch schwetze = <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you can speak Pennsylvania German), [...] "depend" [...] (Es dependt en wennig, waer du bischt = it depends somewhat on who you are); [...] "tschaepp" [...] for [...] "chap" [...] or [...] "guy"; and [...] "tschumbe" [...] for [...] "to jump". Today, many speakers will use Pennsylvania German words for the smaller numerals and English for larger and more complicated numbers, like $27,599.|$|E
