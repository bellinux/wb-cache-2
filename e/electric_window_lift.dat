40|$|DE 102008035746 A 1 UPAB: 20100217 NOVELTY - The device (100) has a {{waveguide}} (110) whose dielectric includes elastic material. A time-domain reflectometry system (120) is {{coupled to}} the waveguide. A signal processing device (130) is coupled to the reflectometry system. The signal processing device {{is designed to}} determine a position (104) of a force effect (102) along the waveguide based on a time difference (106) between a time point (182) of coupling of a signal from the reflectometry system into the waveguide and a time point (184) of receiving of reflection of the signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for spatial-resolution detection of a force effect (2) a computer program having a set of instructions to perform a method for spatial-resolution detection of a force effect. USE - Device for spatial-resolution detection of a force effect during clamping protection of an <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> and an automatic hatch door. ADVANTAGE - The device can determine {{the position of the}} force effect in a spatially continuous manner and in discrete intervals by a number of individual sensors. The device has a simple structure and can be manufactured at low cost...|$|E

50|$|Hayes did {{not give}} up, however, and {{continued}} his passionate internal marketing of the project. As prototypes started to emerge, dealers were invited to test drive sessions, and this increased the enthusiasm for the new car. In addition, Ford took some radical measures to reduce the price on the car. As an example, the car was only offered in three exterior colours (black, white and moonstone blue) and one interior colour (grey). There were also just two equipment options: with or without central locking and <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nearly every {{model was}} {{redesigned}} for 1948, including the $3,820 Sixty Special. With all-new sheet metal, but still riding an exclusive 133-inch wheelbase, the luxurious Sixty Special weighed in at 4,370 pounds shipping weight (over 4,500 pounds curb weight). Inside, <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> and a two-way power bench seat were standard equipment. A clever rainbow-shaped instrument cluster which {{put all the}} gauges directly above the steering column {{in front of the}} driver was used for 1948 only, while a new curved dashboard design added to passenger roominess. The roof-mounted decorative chrome louvers and individually framed side door glass (a Sixty Special design element since 1938) were carried over to this latest model as well. With trim inspired by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the new Sixty Special featured simulated side-scoops and curious tail-fins - resembling the P-38's vertical stabilizers. Its appearance is similar to cross-town rival Chrysler Imperial and the Chrysler New Yorker initially in 1949, and less so with yearly appearance changes.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{on the stock}} McLaren F1 includes full cabin air conditioning, a rarity on most sports cars and a system design which Murray again credited to the Honda NSX, a car he had owned and driven himself for 7 years without, according to the official F1 website, ever needing to change the AC automatic setting. Further comfort features included SeKurit electric defrost/demist windscreen and side glass, <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> <b>lifts,</b> remote central locking, Kenwood 10-disc CD stereo system, cabin access release for opening panels, cabin storage compartment, four-lamp high performance headlight system, rear fog and reversing lights, courtesy lights in all compartments, map reading lights and a gold-plated Facom titanium tool kit and first aid kit (both stored in the car). In addition, tailored, proprietary luggage bags specially designed to fit the vehicle's carpeted storage compartments, including a tailored golf bag, were standard equipment. Airbags are not present in the car. [...] Each customer was given a special edition TAG Heuer 6000 Chronometer wristwatch with its serial number scripted below the centre stem.|$|R
50|$|The revolutionary {{new model}} Nance hoped for was delayed until 1955, {{partially}} because of Packard's merger with Studebaker. Packard stylist Richard A. Teague was called upon by Nance {{to design the}} 1955 line, and to Teague's credit, the 1955 Packard was indeed a sensation when it appeared. Not only was the body completely updated and modernized, but the suspension also was totally new, with torsion bars front and rear, along with an electric control that kept the car level regardless of load or road conditions. Crowning this stunning new design was Packard's brand new ultra-modern overhead-valve V8, displacing 352 cid L, replacing the old, heavy, cast-iron side-valve straight-eight {{that had been used}} for decades. In addition, Packard offered a variety of power, comfort, and convenience features, such as power steering and brakes as well as <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> <b>lifts.</b> But air conditioning was an anomaly. Although available on all makes by the mid-fifties, it was installed on only a handful of cars in 1955 and 1956 despite Packard's status as a luxury car. Model year sales only climbed back to 55,000 units in 1955, including Clipper, in what was a very strong year across the industry.|$|R
