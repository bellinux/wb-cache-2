5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E

Arizonas wreck was later partly salvaged and is now a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
40|$|Serum {{growth hormone}} (GH) levels, plasma {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) and blood glucose were {{determined}} during periods of total starvation in 13 severely obese patients, 2 of whom were suffering from hypopituitarism, and in 2 normal volunteers. In all individuals nitrogen excretion was measured and the total caloric expenditure calculated. The percentile contribution of protein to total caloric expenditure (protein RATIO = PR) appeared to be lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> obese than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normals.</b> GH-values rose steeply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normals</b> on starvation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> serum of 4 of the obese no GH could be found, the others showed a slight to moderate response. When these 2 groups of obese were compared with regard to nitrogen excretion, caloric expenditure and PR, no difference was found. Both hypopituitary patients were treated with a small maintenance dose of cortisone. They tolerated starvation well. Their caloric expenditure was lower, but their nitrogen excretion as well as PR-values were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same range {{as those of the}} other obese. From these findings it is concluded that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> obese patients studied, fat mobilization was certainly not impaired but rather more easily accomplished than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normals.</b> It appeared not to be dependent on demonstrable levels of serum-GH and is probably also independent from other anterior pituitary factors. Plasma-FFA rose less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> obese than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normals.</b> A slight correlation between GH and FFA but no correlation between blood sugar and GH was found on simultaneous determinations...|$|R

5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack of snow. In 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event. Since 1997, Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, the premier international summer ski jumping tournament. Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> hill. In January 2007, Courchevel hosted two rounds of a FIS-organized junior ski jump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> hill. In Nordic combined, the venue has hosted the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup twice, in 1991 and 1992. It also held a World Cup B event in 1997. The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams, and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel.|$|E

5|$|Abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> {{sinus rhythm}} of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} service, both {{ships were}} assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The ships took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> routine of training and fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean, interspersed with periodic maintenance. Both ships toured the Mediterranean in late 1913, making stops in Italy and France, among others. In April 1914, Arkansas was involved in the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, and Wyoming arrived later to support the operation. Two men from Arkansas earned the Medal of Honor for their actions during the initial occupation of the city. After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Wyoming, {{along with the rest of}} Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), steamed to Britain to reinforce the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, stationed in Scapa Flow. Arkansas initially remained in the United States, training gun crews for the expanding wartime fleet. In July 1918, she too was sent to Britain. Neither ship saw action during the war, though they were present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, North Dakota was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet; she participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> peacetime routine of training cruises, fleet maneuvers, and gunnery drills in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean Sea. On 2 November 1910, she crossed the Atlantic for the first time, on a good-will visit to Britain and France. Fleet maneuvers followed in the Caribbean the next spring. Midshipmen training cruises for cadets from the Naval Academy occupied North Dakotas time in the summers of 1912 and 1913. On 1 January 1913, she joined the honor escort for the British armored cruiser , which was carrying the remains of Whitelaw Reid, the United States Ambassador to Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|During the modernization, four of her 15cm {{guns were}} removed and two 8.8cm guns were added. All twelve 1-pounder guns were removed, {{as was the}} ship's stern-mounted torpedo tube. Kaiser Barbarossas {{superstructure}} was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts. The ship's funnels were also lengthened. Kaiser Barbarossas modernization was completed by 1 October 1907, when she was recommissioned for service. By that time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. Consequently, the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet). Kaiser Barbarossa returned to {{her place in the}} I Squadron and she participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> routine of divisional, squadron, and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year. The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the Azores and returned to Kiel on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September.|$|E
5|$|Features of the He 111 were {{apparent}} in the Heinkel He 70.

The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in January 1919, when she arrived in Norfolk on the 4th.

5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E
