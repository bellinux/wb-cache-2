40|$|Abstract. At present, alert {{correlation}} techniques do {{not make}} full use {{of the information that}} is available. We propose a data model for IDS alert correlation called M 2 D 2. It supplies four information types: information related to the characteristics of the monitored information system, information about the vulnerabilities, information about the security tools used for the monitoring, and information about the events observed. M 2 D 2 is formally defined. As far as we know, no other formal model includes the vulnerability and alert parts of M 2 D 2. Three examples of correlations are given. They are rigorously specified using the formal definition of M 2 D 2. As opposed to already published correlation methods, these examples use more than the events generated by security tools; they make use of many concepts formalized in M 2 D 2. 1 Introduction Intrusion detection today faces four major challenges. Firstly, the overall number of alerts generated is overwhelming for operators. Secondly, too many of these alerts falsely indicate security issues and require investigation from these operators. Thirdly, the diagnosis information associated with the alerts is so poor that it requires the operator {{to go back to the}} original data source to understand the diagnosis and assess the real severity of the alert. Finally, the number of undetected attacks (a. k. a false negatives) must be reduced in order to provide an appropriate coverage for the monitoring of the <b>environment.</b> <b>Alarm</b> correlation is the key to the first three challenges: it consists in reducing and conceptually interpreting multiple alarms such that new meanings are assigned to these alarms [1]. In order to reduce false negatives, heterogeneous analyzers are often used to get multiple points of view of the attacks. Multiplying analyzers also multiplies alerts. Alert correlation is therefore all the more essential...|$|R

THE CHOPPER IN THE LEBT LINE The low energy beam transport (LEBT) line carries continuous wave (CW), high intensity beams of protons (5 mA), deuterons (5 mA) and ions (1 mA) with m/q= 3 from the sources to the radiofrequency quadruple. The source voltage for the three different particles are 20, 40 and 60 kV respectively, to match the RFQ input energy of 20 keV/A. The layout of the injector LEBT is shown in Fig. 1. The slow chopper [1] is placed just before the beam stop in the common section of the line. Figure 1 : The injector low energy lines and the slow chopper position. The proton/deuteron line section and the common one are presently installed at CEA Saclay to be tested before being installed in the SPIRAL 2 building.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} interventions to reduce alarm fatigue in the hospital <b>environment.</b> Background. <b>Alarms</b> in the hospital settings may create {{a false sense of}} security. Advancement in healthcare technology generate devices producing valuable information with the intent to serve as warning signs for the bedside clinician. The overwhelming amount of devices in clinical areas compiled with alarm triggers that require no action can create a noisy environment in which clinicians become disengaged to alarm alerts. The Joint Commission hospital national patient safety goal for 2016 calls for the improvement of the clinical alarm system to reduce patient harm. Methods. The review of 895 articles relating to alarms in clinical settings were appraised, and the interventions focused on the reduction of alarm fatigue were chosen for implementation in the hospital. Results. The review of the evidence-based literature has provided suggestions for interventions. The most feasible interventions for reduction or elimination of alarm fatigue were proposed for the hospitalwide initiative. The project provides education for the nursing staff and formation of interdisciplinary committees to establish protocols for alarms management. Conclusion. A project highlighted possible critical events caused by alarm fatigue and offered initiatives to reduce alarm fatigue.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively studied the effects of single versus double layer intestinal closure after typhoid enteric perforation with peritonitis in 902 pediatric patients from September 2007 to April 2012. All the patients underwent laparotomy after resuscitation and antibiotic cover. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: group A (n = 454) double layer closure and group B (n = 448) single layer closure.

To maintain a healthful and safe {{indoor environment}}, {{it is crucial to}} identifying contaminant source locations, strengths and release histories. Accurate and prompt identification of contaminant sources ensures that the contaminant sources can be quickly removed and contaminated spaces can be effectively isolated and cleaned.

40|$|Background Task {{avoidance}} is {{a significant}} predictor of literacy skills. However, it remains unclear whether the relation between the two is reciprocal and whether it is affected by the type of literacy outcome, who is rating children's task avoidance, and the children's gender. Aim The purpose of this longitudinal {{study was to examine the}} cross-lagged relations between teacher and parent ratings of children's task avoidance and different literacy skills. Sample One hundred and seventy-two Greek children (91 girls, 81 boys) were followed from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Methods Children were assessed on reading accuracy, reading fluency, and spelling to dictation. Parents and teachers rated the children's task-avoidant behaviour. Results Results of structural equation modelling showed that the cross-lagged relations varied as a function of the literacy outcome, who rated the children's task avoidance, and children's gender. Earlier reading and spelling performance predicted subsequent parent-rated task avoidance, but parent-rated task avoidance did not predict subsequent reading and spelling performance (with the exception of spelling in Grade 3). Teacher-rated task avoidance and reading fluency/spelling had a reciprocal relationship over time. In addition, the effects of teacher-rated task avoidance on future spelling were significantly stronger in boys than in girls. Conclusions This suggests that poor reading and spelling performance can lead to subsequent task avoidance in both classroom and home situations.
