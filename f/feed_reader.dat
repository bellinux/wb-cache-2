2500|$|Some {{portions}} of the underlying architecture, including the rendering engine and security framework, have been improved. New features include tabbed browsing, page zooming, an integrated search box, a <b>feed</b> <b>reader,</b> better internationalization, and improved support for web standards, although it does not pass the Acid2 or Acid3 tests. Security enhancements include a phishing filter, stronger encryption on Windows Vista (256-bit from 128-bit in XP), and a [...] "Delete browsing history" [...] button to easily clear private data. It is also {{the first version of}} Internet Explorer which is branded and marketed under the name 'Windows', instead of 'Microsoft'. IE7 shipped as the default browser in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and was offered as a replacement for Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. IE7 was superseded by Internet Explorer 8 in March 2009.|$|E

5000|$|Web-based <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> {{and news}} {{aggregators}} require no software installation {{and make the}} user's [...] "feeds" [...] available on any computer with Web access. Some aggregators syndicate (combine) web feeds into new feeds, e.g., taking all football-related items from several sports feeds and providing a new football feed.|$|R

50|$|In computing, a news aggregator, also {{termed a}} feed aggregator, <b>feed</b> <b>reader,</b> news reader, RSS reader or simply aggregator, is client {{software}} or a web application which aggregates syndicated web content such as online newspapers, blogs, podcasts, and video blogs (vlogs) in one location for easy viewing. RSS is a synchronized subscription system. Basically, RSS uses {{extensible markup language}} (XML) to structure pieces of information to be aggregated in a <b>feed</b> <b>reader</b> that displays the information in a user-friendly interface. The updates distributed include, for example, journal tables of contents, podcasts, videos, and news items.|$|E

50|$|Types {{of content}} {{syndicated}} include RSS or Atom Feeds and full content. With RSS feeds, headlines, summaries, {{and sometimes a}} modified version of the original full content is displayed on users' <b>feed</b> <b>readers.</b> With full content, the entire content—which might be text, audio, video, applications/widgets or user-generated content—appears unaltered on the publisher's site.|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} of RSS and similar feed formats is growing fast. This paper gives {{an overview of}} the standards and implementations in this field, and analyzes whether they allow scheduling the retrieval of feed updates. As will be shown, such support is very limited and current <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> therefore poll providers at fixed rates. The measurements performed as part of our study show that in general a clear mismatch exists between such fixed polling rate of <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> and the rate at which providers update their feeds; a significant performance gain is therefore possible by embedding scheduling information within feeds. This paper proposes a scheduling approach that both reduces lag in updates for active feeds and reduces wasted resources for less active feeds. Simulations show that our approach reduces the perceived lag by twenty percent, while having the same resource requirements as a fixed-rate algorithm...|$|R

5000|$|GENWI {{was a free}} web-based news reader, or aggregator, {{initially}} {{released in}} March 2007. Genwi provided a news feed service by enabling users to publish their feeds to one profile and follow others' news feeds in the <b>feed</b> <b>reader</b> - this <b>feed</b> <b>reader</b> was called [...] "Wire" [...] and was capable of reading RSS, Media RSS, iTunes RSS and ATOM feeds. Genwi offered a suite of social networking features built into the RSS reader. Users were able to add friends, send messages, leave comments and share individual feed items. The site underwent a major redesign in November 2008 and was shut down in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>feed</b> <b>reader</b> or [...] "aggregator" [...] {{program can}} be used to check feeds and to display new articles. Client-side readers may also be {{designed}} as standalone programs or as extensions to existing programs like web browsers.|$|E
50|$|Feeds {{are more}} often subscribed to {{directly}} by users with aggregators or <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> which combine the contents of multiple web feeds for display on a single screen or series of screens. Some modern web browsers incorporate aggregator features. Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser.|$|R
50|$|Another {{frequent}} {{criticism is}} that despite its blog-like {{style and the}} increasing poplarity of <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> (especially in the political world), The Note does not publish its content via RSS (except for its podcast). ABCNews.com offers a single RSS feed {{for all of its}} political content, of which The Note is only one part. This feed does not contain the full text of The Note, but instead only a headline and link.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with news aggregators is that the volume of articles can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when the user has many web feed subscriptions. As a solution, many <b>feed</b> <b>readers</b> allow users to tag each feed with one or more keywords which can be used to sort and filter the available articles into easily navigable categories. Another option is to import the user's Attention Profile to filter items based on their relevance to the user's interests.|$|R

50|$|Both RSS and Atom {{are widely}} {{supported}} and {{are compatible with}} all major consumer feed readers. RSS gained wider use because of early <b>feed</b> <b>reader</b> support.Technically, Atom has several advantages: less restrictive licensing, IANA-registered MIME type, XML namespace, URI support, Relax NG support.|$|E

40|$|Feeds {{have become}} an {{important}} information channel on the Web, but the management of feed metadata so far has received little attention. It is hard for feed publishers to manage and publish their feed information in a unified format, and for feed consumers to manage and use their feed subscription data across various <b>feed</b> <b>readers,</b> and {{to share it with}} other users. We present a system for managing feed metadata using feeds, which we call "feed feeds".
