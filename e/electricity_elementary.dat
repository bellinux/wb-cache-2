25|$|Other {{than the}} {{designation}} “Radio (or Electronics) Technician Training,” no official name appears on {{records for the}} overall program; however, Electronics Training Program (ETP) was the commonly used name. Official records sometimes show different names for the two levels of schools: <b>Elementary</b> <b>Electricity</b> & Radio Materiel (EE) rather than Primary, and Advanced Radio Materiel (ARM) rather than Secondary. Since there was little “elementary” content in the EE curriculum, these initials were usually taken to mean Electrical Engineering & Radio Materiel.|$|R
50|$|High voltage was of {{interest}} to early researchers working {{on the problem of}} transmission over distance. They knew from <b>elementary</b> <b>electricity</b> principle that the same amount of power could be transferred on a cable by doubling the voltage and halving the current. Due to Joule's Law, they also knew that the capacity of a wire is proportional to the square of the current traveling on it, regardless the voltage, and so by doubling the voltage, the same cable would be capable of transmitting the same amount of power four times the distance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{occupation}} of the villagers is farming. Banana, mango, lichi, wheat and maize are the main plants grown in the lands of this village. Basic facilities like <b>electricity,</b> road, and <b>elementary</b> school are available by efforts of the Government of India. But still many people live in mud houses {{who are unable to}} afford a pakka house. Because of lesser career opportunity in village, people are slowly migrating to metropolitan cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Bombay and likewise in search of better means of livelihood which accounts for the decline in village population in recent years.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] World War II, Oklahoma A was one of six schools selected by the United States Navy to give the Primary School in the Electronics Training Program (ETP), also known as Naval Training School <b>Elementary</b> <b>Electricity</b> and Radio Materiel (NTS EE). Starting in March 1942, each month {{a new group of}} 100 Navy students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. Cordell Hall, the newest dormitory, was used for housing and meals; lectures and lab sessions were held in the Engineering Building. Professor Emory B. Phillips was the Director of Instruction. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years. At a given time, some 500 Navy students were on the campus, a significant fraction of the war-years enrollment. The training activity continued until June 1945, and served a total of about 7,000 students; among these was Robert B. Kamm, a future professor and president of Oklahoma State University. During some of the war years, the Navy also had a Yeoman training activity for WAVES and SPARS on the campus.|$|R
40|$|Trotz umfangreicher empirischer Forschung in den letzten Jahrzehnten zu Schülervorstellungen in der elementaren Elektrizitätslehre liegt bisher kein Testinstrument vor, das eine effektive und zuverlässige Erfassung der Basiskonzepte im Schulunterricht ermöglicht und gleichzeitig für die empirische Forschung verwendbar ist. Am AECC Physik der Universität Wien wird ein Multiple-Choice-Fragebogen mit zweistufigen Items entwickelt, der psychometrisch so ausgereift sein soll, dass diese Vorgaben erfüllt werden. Das Hauptziel dieser Arbeit liegt in der Weiterentwicklung von sieben bisher einstufigen Testitems zur Abbildung von lokalen und sequentiellen Vorstellungen, die einen Teil dieses Fragebogens bilden. Es wurden 19 problemzentrierte Interviews geführt und mit Methoden der qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse ausgewertet. Die Ergebnisse bildeten die Basis für die Entwicklung von Erklärungsdistraktoren. In weiterer Folge wurden die dadurch entstandenen Testitems von 78 SchülerInnen schriftlich beantwortet und die verschiedenen Antwortmöglichkeiten durch 19 Follow-Up-Interviews untersucht, wodurch Rückschlüsse auf das Vorhandensein von Schülervorstellungen gezogen werden können. Die Ergebnisse bringen gut funktionierende Items hervor, die verschiedene Schülervorstellungen eindeutig abbilden können. Darüber hinaus können die gewonnenen Ergebnisse und weitere Analysen des umfangreichen Datenmaterials für die zukünftige Weiterentwicklung des gesamten Testinstruments von Nutzen sein. Despite {{extensive}} {{empirical research}} {{in recent decades}} to students’ conceptions in <b>elementary</b> <b>electricity</b> so far there is no test instrument that effectively and reliable captures the basic concepts {{in the classroom and}} at the same time is applicable for empirical physics education research. At the AECC for Physics at the University of Vienna, a multiple-choice questionnaire is developed with two-tier items that should be psychometrically matured to meet these requirements. The main objective of this work is the development of seven previously one-tiered test items for mapping local and sequential concepts, which form a part of this questionnaire. 19 problem-centered interviews were conducted and analyzed using methods of qualitative content analysis. The results had built the basis for the development of distractors which present reasons for he given answer. Subsequently, the new set of test items were administered to 78 students and 19 Follow-up interviews helped to explore, what conclusions can be drawn from the various response options about the existence of students' conceptions. The results bring out well-functioning items that can map different student’s conceptions clearly. Beyond that, the results obtained and further analysis of the extensive data can be useful for future development of the entire test instrument.

40|$|Almost {{all of the}} 2 {{billion people}} with no access to {{electricity}} live in developing countries, and {{four out of five}} live in rural areas. Nepal is a clear example of that relationship. Families in the remote areas use precious trees for cooking, room heating and light. These activities, especially the indoor cooking on open fireplaces, have a direct chronic impact on the health and extremely low life expectancy of the women and children along with devastating deforestation. In a remote and poverty stricken mountain village in the northwestern district of Humla Nepal, Kathmandu University and the ISIS Foundation are trying new ways to utilize the locally available renewable energy resources in a more affordable, sustainable and appropriate way. The rich solar energy resource is tapped to generate <b>electricity</b> for an <b>elementary</b> lighting system. A self-tracking solar PV system {{in the center of the}} village powers three 1 -Watt WLED (white light emitting diode) lights per household through underground wiring. Additionally, in each household an efficient, smokeless, metal stove for cooking and heating is installed. It consumes only half the usual amount of firewood, enabling a smoke free, and save environment in the home. A pit latrine per house, and a common village drinking water system are also an intrinsically part of the holistic community development project. Project planning, installation, training for operation and maintenance, are all implemented in close partnership with the community and are part of the excitement. Renewable energy resources are a foundation for holistic community development of our poor and marginalized 2 billion neighbors. This paper describes the process, implementation and partial evaluation of the project...|$|R

During some of the war years, the Navy also had a Yeoman training activity for WAVES and SPARS on the campus.Much of the growth of Oklahoma A&M and the campus architectural integrity can be attributed to work of Henry G. Bennett, who served as the school's president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the physical expansion of the university campus. The plan was adopted in 1937 and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, making the university what it is today, including the Georgian architecture that permeates the campus. The focal point of his vision was a centrally located library building, which became a reality when the Edmon Low Library opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the construction of the Student Union, which opened in 1950. Subsequent additions and renovations have made the building one of the largest student union buildings in the world at 611000 sq ft. A complete renovation and further expansion of the building began in 2010.|$|R
40|$|The author {{discusses}} the emigration of population from a specific agrarian and cattle-breeding area named Rugova (Kosovo). The area in question presents in geographical, historical and ethnographic sense a clearly isolated community, consisting of 13 villages of straggling type, with approximately 3, 000 inhabitants. The district is homogenous, {{with regard to}} the way of life, customs and values, nationality structure (Albanian population), language (Albanian), religion (Moslems), appertainance (Kelemend), etc. Under conditions of homogenous classical agrarian way of life, the population of Rugova has through centuries been chained to the native soil. The only exception were temporary desertions caused by war, unstable political situations, pressures from various national regimes, economical motives (seasonal stockbreeding) etc. The largest emigrations from Rugova, that turned into the definite migration type, were conditioned by economical factors. Incomes from cattle-breeding and farming, based upon the extensive way of utilization of natural goods, could not procure enough means for life of a larger and constantly increasing number of people, so the emigration of »stomach in search of bread« started. Desertions of the native soil have been known since the Turks 2 ̆ 7 time, and have later grown more intense, especially after World War II. In all periods the emigration of population from Rugova has been directed towards the rich valley called »Dukađinska nizija«, highly suitable for agriculture. Emigration has been so strong that in spite of the high natural increase, the population of Rugova increased in the period 1948 — 1961 only by 17 percent (the Albanian population of Kosovo by 84 percent), while in the period 1961 — 1971 only by 2 percent (the Albanian population of the Province by 42 percent). In several villages relative as well as absolute depopulation took place. Unfortunately, Rugova has still no trafic Communications, no <b>electricity,</b> no complete <b>elementary</b> school, no out-patient clinic, no oultural institutions or servicing, the population is without health insurance, etc. All these circumstances, accompanied by inadequate social basis, make life of Rugova inhabitants more difficult, and accordingly, encourage emigration. Other important channels, by which people leave, are schooling, marriage, etc. Under such depresive circumstances the complete depopulation of Rugova is to be expected in near future. It will mean the extinction of a historically and culturally very interesting area, with numerous specific characteristics. It will also mean the extinction of cattle-breeding, for which there are very favourable natural conditions, as well as for tourism, vacations and recreation. Social care and initiative, however small, could influence the intensity and selection of emigration...|$|R
