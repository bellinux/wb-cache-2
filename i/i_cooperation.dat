40|$|The {{objective}} of this research paper is to present a suitable scheme of regional integration which can be applied between developing countries and less developed countries. This new scheme is called the Cooperation Effect Creation Scheme (CEC-Scheme).

This paper proposes that implementation of the CEC-Scheme will facilitate the fulfilment of successful regionalism between developing and less developed countries. The CEC-Scheme will generate the cooperative creating effect within the same regional bloc.

40|$|We have {{established}} rat PC 12 pheochromocytoma cell lines stably expressing the estrogen-activatable transcription factor FosER to identify genes {{that can be}} regulated by c-Fos in this neuronal cell type. Induction of ectopic c-Fos activity in PC 12 cells increased the mRNA levels of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and tyrosine hydroxylase genes with similar kinetics and to the same maximal level as nerve growth factor treatment. In both cases the rate of transcription initiation was increased. Induction of the ODC gene occurred {{even in the absence}} of protein synthesis, indicating direct regulation by FosER. ODC expression, however, was not induced by a mutant FosER protein containing a proline insertion in the basic region of the c-Fos moiety, demonstrating the requirement for a functional DNA-binding domain. These data show that FosER, and by extrapolation c-Fos, can directly activate transcription of the endogenous ODC gene in PC 12 cells by binding to cis-regulatory sequences. Activation of the ODC gene was unexpectedly transient, as transcripts returned to the basal level after prolonged exposure of PC 12 cells to FosER activity. Furthermore, ODC transcription was not at all induced by FosER in rat fibroblasts. To account for this cell-specific action of FosER, we propose that stimulation of the ODC gene by FosER requires either (<b>i)</b> <b>cooperation</b> with another transcription factor(s) or (ii) a specific pattern of modification which is present in PC 12 cells but not in otherwise unstimulated fibroblasts. One or both of these mechanisms may be employed by cells to achieve selective gene activation in response to apparently stereotyped induction of c-fos...|$|E
40|$|Theory of {{indirect}} reciprocity {{is important in}} explaining cooperation between humans. Since a partner of a social interaction often changes, an individual should assess his partner by using social information such as reputation and make decisions whether to help him or not. To those who have `good 2 ̆ 7 social reputation does a player give aid as reciprocation, whereas he has to refuse {{to help those who}} have `bad 2 ̆ 7 reputation. Otherwise benefits of altruism is easily exploited by them. Little has been known, however, about the definition of `goodness 2 ̆ 7 in reputation. What kind of actions are and should be regarded as good and what kind of actions bad? And what sort of goodness enables sustaining exchange of altruism? We herein challenge this question with an evolutionary perspective.

We examine the condition for evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) over 4096 possible cases exhaustively.

Each in the leading eight shares two common characteristics: (<b>i)</b> <b>cooperation</b> with good persons is regarded as good while defection against them is regarded as bad, and (ii) defection against bad persons should be regarded as a good behavior because it works as sanction.

40|$|Background: Inspired by the jubilee of the Ukrainian Studies Department, one of {{the units}} of the Institute of Slavic Studies at the University of Wroclaw, {{the author of the}} article {{presents}} activities and academic achievements of its faculty members. The article has not only a cognitive character, but is also aimed at establishing scientific cooperation with other Ukrainian Studies centers in Poland and abroad. Purpose: The aim of the article is to present Ukrainian Studies at the University of Wroclaw – including its origins, research interests and scientific achievements of its members, as well as a short description of the individual cooperation with other research centers. Results: Ukrainian Studies Department at the Institute of Slavic Studies was officially founded in 2000 / 2001. However, eminent scientists – such as Marian Jakóbiec, Leszek Ossowski, Zbigniew Baranski, Franciszek Sielicki – who had founded Slavic Studies in Wroclaw laid the foundation for its establishment. Because their accomplishments have already been discussed in several other sources, the author of this article focused on discussing research interests and scientific achievements of the faculty members of the Ukrainian Studies Department starting from its beginnings until the present day. In addition to presenting monographs and “milestone” publications of individual researchers from the two fields of philology: literature (Agnieszka Matusiak, Sylwia Wójtowicz Anna Ursulenko, Jadwiga Skowron, Mateusz Świetlicki) and linguistics (Diana Wieczorek, Oleh Beley, Przemysław Jóźwikiewicz, Julia Rysicz-Szafraniec, Olga Barabasz-Rewak), the author describes the Department’s <b>i</b> <b>cooperation</b> with other universities, including the practice of hiring native speakers as teachers of not only the Ukrainian language, but also other philological subjects.

This dissertation studies two of the most relevant research issues on Economics of Innovation: (<b>i)</b> <b>cooperation</b> in innovative activities, and (ii) the relationship between innovation and productivity. In doing this, I use data at the. firm level from the Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS 3) and from the Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE). The Community Innovation Surveys take place every 4 years in European countries to investigate innovation {{activities performed}} by. firms.

The ESEE is an unbalanced panel survey of Spanish manufacturing. firms with 10 or more workers, starting in 1990 and sponsored by the Ministry of Industry. A detailed description of these surveys can be found in each chapter. This introduction is organized in three parts. Firstly, I introduce the two issues at stake: cooperation in innovative activities and the relationship between innovation and productivity. I focus on contextualizing both topics in the current development of literature on innovation, as well as on specifying my contributions to this literature. Secondly, I present the structure of the dissertation, summarizing the contents of each chapter. Finally, the last part of this introduction is concerned with the main policy implications of the issues covered by this dissertation. [Resumen]Las actividades de innovación realizadas por las empresas y el impacto de dichas actividades son de interés primordial tanto para economistas como para responsables de política económica. El análisis de estas actividades requiere el conocimiento tanto de los factores que afectan a la capacidad innovadora de las empresas como el conocimiento del impacto de las actividades innovadoras en la actividad económica de las empresas a través de cambios en la demanda y en sus costes. Esta tesis estudia dos de los temas de investigación más relevantes de la Economía de la Innovación: (i) la cooperación en actividades innovadoras, y (ii) la relación entre innovación y productividad.

40|$|International {{environmental}} cooperation is gaining {{more and more}} importance in a world with global climate change. The problem of climate change is caused by emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). With transboundary GHG pollution, however, there is currently no a world government that is able to force polluters {{to take into account}} the damage cost of other countries caused by their pollution. This differentiates international {{environmental cooperation}} from the issue of domestic environmental regulation in which a regulator is present. This thesis contains three chapters that study international environmental cooperation. The first two chapters are game-theoretic analyses, while the third one is empirical. A significant reduction in global GHG emissions requires (<b>i)</b> <b>cooperation</b> of countries in emission abatement and (ii) the development of technology. Chapter 1 covers both topics (i) and (ii). Chapter 2 investigates the implications of climate policymaking for the development of abatement technology in small countries. Chapter 3 is concerned with the effect of an important climate treaty – the Framework Convention of Climate Change. Abatement of GHG emissions is a global public good. An international environmental agreement (IEA) is a coalition mechanism that aims to overcome the free-riding problem underlying this public good game. Much of the IEA theory relies on a particular type of participation game in which countries individually decide whether to join or stay out of an IEA and the resulting IEA makes abatement decisions for its members. Chapter 1 modifies the canonical model that is used to study IEAs, considering both mixed and pure strategies at the participation stage, and including a prior cost-reducing investment stage. The use of mixed strategies at the participation stage reverses a familiar result and also its policy implication: with mixed strategies, equilibrium participation and welfare is higher in equilibria that involve higher investment. Nations’ use of mixed rather than pure strategies creates endogenous risk; the equilibrium participation probability increases with risk aversion. The previous literature on climate policy pays insufficient attention to the role of small countries, which, in the aggregate, account for a substantial proportion of the global GHG emission. Chapter 2 investigates how alternative climate policy instruments and learning about environmental damage affect ex ante investment in the adoption of technology in small countries. I consider three policy instruments that are widely discussed in the current debate on climate policymaking: emission standard, harmonized taxes and auctioned emission permits. I identify and discuss three effects that reduce investment efficiency: the effect of uncertain participation, the strategic effect on participation and the strategic effect on regulation. Either with both learning and quadratic abatement costs or without learning, harmonized taxes outperform emission standard and auctioned permits in terms of investment efficiency. Interestingly, when learning is infeasible, a large cost of staying out of the international environmental agreement could be beneficial. Whether or not learning improves investment efficiency depends on the size of this nonparticipation cost. The IEA theory is generally pessimistic regarding the chance of a treaty with legally-binding restrictions in solving the climate change problem. A natural question thus arises: how about a climate treaty without legally-binding restrictions? Chapter 3 aims to answer this question using a real world example. Before 2005 when Kyoto Protocol was put into force, the Framework Convention of Climate Change (FCCC) did not impose any legally-binding restrictions on GHG emissions. Carbon dioxide is a main GHG. In Chapter 3, I investigate the effect of FCCC membership on countries’ carbon emissions during the period of 1992 - 2004. I find out positive and significant effects of FCCC membership on the control of carbon emissions in the Annex I (industrialized) countries. Although a number of non-Annex I countries were attracted to the FCCC, the FCCC membership had no significant impacts on the carbon emissions of these non-Annex I countries. This fact highlights the canonical tradeoff of extensive margin and intensive margin in coalition formation...|$|E

From {{an early}} notion of cooperation as a deliberate suppression of innate selfish preferences, {{a growing body}} of literature has turned the general perception towards prosocial behaviour as something intuitive, sometimes actively oppressed for the sake of selfish needs and wishes. If the dual-process framework from psychology gives a better description of decision making than do the classical economic models, this will have important implications for many economic models. Testing the social heuristics hypothesis through a sequential prisoners’ dilemma conducted both in the lab and by an online survey, I find no conclusive evidence that increased deliberation systematically changes willingness to cooperate with strangers. This is the first study (to my knowledge) to isolate the effect of a manipulation through preferences. The results hold for both a general regression of cooperation on the deliberation treatment, and for the main analysis, with separate effects through preferences and beliefs...|$|R
