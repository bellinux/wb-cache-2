40|$|VolcanoBot was {{developed}} to map volcanic vents and their underlying conduit systems, which are rarely preserved and generally inaccessible to human exploration. It uses a PrimeSense Carmine 1. 09 sensor for mapping and carries an IR temperature sensor, analog distance sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) inside a protective shell. The first field test succeeded in collecting valuable scientific data but revealed several needed improvements, including more rugged cable connections and mechanical couplers, increased ground clearance, and higher-torque motors for uphill mobility. The second field test significantly improved {{on all of these}} aspects but it traded electrical ruggedness for reduced data collection speed. Data collected by the VolcanoBots, while <b>intermittent,</b> <b>yield</b> the first insights into the cm-scale geometry of volcanic fissures at depths of up to 25 m. VolcanoBot was deployed at the 1969 Mauna Ulu fissure system on Kīlauea volcano in Hawai'i. It collected first-of-its-kind data from inside the fissure system. We hypothesized that 1) fissure sinuosity should decrease with depth, 2) irregularity should be persistent with depth, 3) any blockages in the conduit should occur at the narrowest points, and 4) the fissure should narrow with depth until it is too narrow for VolcanoBot to pass or is plugged with solidified lava. Our field campaigns did not span enough lateral or vertical area to test sinuosity. The preliminary data indicate that 1) there were many irregularities along fissures at depth, 2) blockages occurred, but not at obviously narrow locations, and 3) the conduit width remained a consistent 0. 4 – 0. 5 m for most of the upper 10 m that we analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Geomagnetism is {{characterized}} by intermittent polarity reversals and rapid fluctuations. We have recently proposed a coupled macro-spin model to describe these dynamics {{based on the idea}} that the whole dynamo mechanism is described by the coherent interactions of many small dynamo elements. In this paper, we further develop this idea and construct a minimal model for magnetic variations. This simple model naturally yields many of the observed features of geomagnetism: its time evolution, the power spectrum, the frequency distribution of stable polarity periods, etc. This model has coexistent two phases; i. e. the cluster phase which determines the global dipole magnetic moment and the expanded phase which gives random perpetual perturbations that <b>yield</b> <b>intermittent</b> polarity flip of the dipole moment. This model can also describe the synchronization of the spin oscillation. This corresponds to the case of sun and the model well describes the quasi-regular cycles of the solar magnetism. Furthermore, by analyzing the relevant terms of MHD equation based on our model, we have obtained a scaling relation for the magnetism for planets, satellites, sun, and stars.

Methods High quality photographs with standard distance and hand positioning were analysed for the presence of HOA and subsequently compared with standard radiographs and clinical examination in 381 random participants in the AGES-Reykjavik Study, a large population study. The mean age of the participants was 76 years. Results Using the photographic method, the most commonly affected joints were the second DIP joints followed by the third DIP joints and second and third PIP joints. Both interobserver (ICC = 0. 83) and intraobserver reading agreements (ICC = 0. 89) were acceptable. On comparison with radiography and clinical examination, aggregate scores were significantly correlated (R s 0. 35 - 0. 69), more so in females (R s 0. 53 - 0. 72) than males. Hand pain in males showed very little association with HOA findings by the three methods but all methods showed a comparable moderate association with hand pain in females. The performance of photography in predicting pain on most days for at least a month in females was comparable to that of radiography and clinical examination (AUC 0. 63 p = 0. 004).

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{results from}} flight tests conducted in an over-sea environment, {{for the purpose}} of characterizing the air-to-ground (AG) channel, for future unmanned aircraft system (UAS) communication system analysis and design. These results are for the first of a set of several flight tests conducted in different ground site (GS) environments. An ultimate aim of all these tests is the development of models for the AG channel {{that can be used in}} communication system evaluation. In this report we provide measured results for propagation path loss, root-mean square delay spread (RMS-DS), and the correlation coefficient of the primary received signal components on the four antennas (two antennas for C-band, two for L-band). For path loss, the curved-earth two-ray model provides a reasonable fit to the measured data, altered by several dB at the shortest link distances by aircraft antenna pattern effects. This two-ray model also accounts for the majority of measured RMS-DS results of a few tens of nanoseconds, except for the occasional intermittent reflections from surface objects. These <b>intermittent</b> reflections <b>yield</b> RMS-DS values up to several hundred nanoseconds. For portions of the flight path that were over a harbor area highly populated with boats, the channel was found to be more "continuously dispersive," with RMS-DS reaching approximately 250 ns. A separate model will be developed for this over-harbor setting. The correlation coefficient results are still undergoing analysis; preliminary observations are that correlation between signals on the same-band antennas is generally large (> 0. 6) for the C-band straight flight paths, whereas for the L-band signals and for the oval-shaped flight paths the correlation is generally small (below 0. 4). Inter-band correlations are typically very small, and are well modeled as zero-mean Gaussian in distribution, with a standard deviation less than 0. 2. Hence the over-sea channel effects in the two bands can be considered uncorrelated, which will allow for good diversity gains in dual-band systems. We describe initial modeling approaches for the over-sea channel; complete models for this and the over-harbor setting will appear in a subsequent report...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In the State of Durango, México, {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{is the most}} {{important}} food product used for direct human consumption, after grain cooking. Common bean is cultivated mainly under rainfed conditions in despite of its decisive role in local economy, human nutrition and nutraceutical contribution for human health. Under rainfed conditions water shortage (<b>intermittent</b> drought) and <b>yield</b> losses in common beans are the main factors causing negative impacts on the farmer´s economy. Some {{attempts have been made to}} use common beans under irrigated conditions in order to improve water productivity and to stabilize seed yield. Early maturity and low water requirements were introduced in modern ‘pinto’ common bean cultivars in order to improve seed yield. Characterization of modern cultivars is required in order to implement the use of technological tools for precise irrigation scheduling; as well as for phenology and yield prediction. The growing degree days (°D) concept, which is based on actual temperatures, is considered as a simple and accurate method to predict when a certain plant stage will occur (Miller et al., 2001).

Integrated crop management (ICM) {{is a combination}} of water, crop, and nutrient management that optimizes the synergistic interaction of these components aiming at improving resource use efficiency, i. e. high productivity of water, land, and labor. The objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of crop establishment method, organic matter amendment, NPK management, and water management on yield of lowland rice. Five series of experiments were conducted at Sukamandi and Kuningan Experimental Stations, West Java. The first experiment was focused on crop establishment method, i. e. plant spacing and number of seedlings per hill. The second, third, and fourth experiments were directed to study the effect of NPK and organic matter applications on rice yield.

Pod <b>yield</b> decreased 70 %, 55 % and 35 % under severe, medium and mild stress, respectively. Pod yield varied among genotypes, and showed significant genotype-by-treatment effects. Root length density (RLD) varied among genotypes before and after stress, although RLD did not discriminate tolerant from sensitive lines. Total water uptake and RLD under water stress had a weakly significant relationship. Water extraction from the soil profile was highest under severe stress. Water uptake varied among genotypes in all water regimes, but correlated with pod yield under WW conditions.

The daily dose of ceftazidime was 300 mg/liter/ 24 h given either as a continuous infusion or as three bolus doses. The <b>intermittent</b> dosing regimen <b>yielded</b> peak and trough concentrations after the fourth dose of 92. 3 (standard deviation, 8. 0) and 1. 4 (standard deviation, 0. 9) mg/liter, respectively. Continuous administration yielded concentrations of approximately 20 mg/liter. To study efficacy, three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, ATCC 27853, CF 4, and CF 16, were used. The MICs of ceftazidime for these strains were 1, 4, and 16 mg/liter, respectively. Strain CF 16 was killed initially during both regimens and then started to regrow. At the end of the fourth dosing interval, i. e., after 32 h, viable counts showed no difference between the regimens. Strains ATCC 27853 and CF 4 were killed initially during both dosing schedules, and after the first dosing interval viable counts were similar. However, after the fourth interval, there was a marked difference between bacterial counts during continuous and intermittent infusion, being 2. 2 and 2. 8 log 10, respectively, demonstrating a greater efficacy during continuous infusion. The results indicate that, in the absence of other factors, a sustained level of ceftazidime around or slightly above the MIC is not high enough to maintain efficacy over more than one (8 -h) dosing interval.

In the Middle Atlantic Bight of the east coast, U. S. A., a “cold pool” of relict winter water is isolated {{by the development of}} a strong seasonal thermocline on the shelf. Oxygen concentrations were monitored in and above the cold pool from March 1988 to May 1989, with electrodes moored at 19 and 38 m at a 42 -m station off the Delmarva Peninsula, eastern U. S. A. An oxygen-flux simulation model was constructed to describe long-term changes in oxygen concentration and saturation. The model utilized biological rate and biomass measurements obtained at the mooring location during cruises. Vertical eddy diffusion was constrained by comparison with the redistribution of chlorofluorocarbons and heat after stratification, and by sensitivity analyses. Model predictions of the average daily change in oxygen concentration and saturation at 38 m were in good agreement with average changes recorded by moored oxygen sensors, when biological generation of oxygen was approximately equal to the thermotrophic consumption. Strong, but transient, fluctuations concentration and saturation were clearly associated with specific advective events, and had little lasting impact on the overall long-term trends. Consequently, model parameters derived from <b>intermittent,</b> cruise-based observations <b>yielded</b> satisfactory predictions of long-term trends.

40|$|International audienceDrought is a {{predominant}} {{cause of}} low yields worldwide. There is {{an urgent need}} for more water efficient cropping systems facing large water consumption of irrigated agriculture and high unproductive losses via runoff and evaporation. Identification of yield-limiting constraints in the plant–soil–atmosphere continuum {{are the key to}} improved management of plant water stress. Crop ecology provides a systematic approach for this purpose integrating soil hydrology and plant physiology into the context of crop production. We review main climate, soil and plant properties and processes that determine yield in different water-limited environments. From this analysis, management measures for cropping systems under specific drought conditions are derived. Major findings from literature analysis are as follows. (1) Unproductive water losses such as evaporation and runoff increase from continental in-season rainfall climates to storage-dependent winter rainfall climates. Highest losses occur under tropical residual moisture regimes with short intense rainy season. (2) Sites with a climatic dry season require adaptation via phenology and water saving to ensure stable <b>yields.</b> <b>Intermittent</b> droughts can be buffered via the root system, which is still largely underutilised for better stress resistance. (3) At short-term better management options such as mulching and date of seeding allow to adjust cropping systems to site constraints. Adapted cultivars can improve the synchronisation between crop water demand and soil supply. At long term, soil hydraulic and plant physiological constraints can be overcome by changing tillage systems and breeding new varieties with higher stress resistance. (4) Interactions between plant and soil, particularly in the rhizosphere, are a way towards better crop water supply. Targeted management of such plant–soil interactions is still at infancy. We conclude that understanding site-specific stress hydrology is imperative to select the most efficient measures to mitigate stress. Major progress in future can be expected from crop ecology focussing on the management of complex plant (root) –soil interactions...|$|R

We determined the compartmental pharmacokinetics of dantrolene, simulated the concentration time course based on currently recommended dosing, and suggest an optimal regimen. Nine volunteers (55 - 89 kg) received IV infusions of dantrolene (5 mg/kg over 30 min followed by 0. 05 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1) for 5 h). Venous blood samples were drawn for up to 60 h, and dantrolene plasma concentrations were determined by reverse phase, high-performance liquid chromatography. One, two, and three compartmental models were fitted to the data, and a covariate analysis was performed. All calculations were performed with NONMEM using the population approach. The data were adequately described by a two-compartment model with the following typical variable values (median +/- se) : volumes of distribution V 1 = 3. 24 +/- 0. 61 L; V 2 = 22. 9 +/- 1. 53 L; plasma clearance CL el= 0. 03 +/- 0. 003 L/min; and distributional clearance CL dist= 1. 24 +/- 0. 22 L/min.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} an ultrasonic goal-seeking algorithm while using ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC), an electroactive polymer, as the actuator to drive a vessel towards a goal. The signal transmitting and receiving circuits as well as the goal seeking algorithm are described in detail. Two test vessels were created; one was a larger vessel that contained all necessary components for autonomy. The second was a smaller vessel that contained only the sensors and IPMC strips, and all power and signals were transmitted via an umbilical cord. To increase the propulsive efforts of the second, smaller vessel, fins were added to the IPMC strips, increasing the surface area over 700 %, determined to yield a 22 -fold force increase. After extensive testing, {{it was found that the}} three IPMC strips, used as oscillating fins, could not generate enough propulsion to move either vessel, with or without fins. With the addition of fins, the oscillating frequency was reduced from 0. 86 -Hz to 0. 25 -Hz. However, the goal-seeking algorithm was successful in guiding the vessel towards the target, an ultrasonic transmitter. When moved manually according to the instructions given by the algorithm, the vessel successfully reached the goal. Using assumptions based on prior experiments regarding the speed of an IPMC propelled vessel, the trial in which the goal was to the left of the axis required 18. 2 % more time to arrive at the goal than the trial in which the goal was to the right. This significant difference is due to the goal-seeking algorithm??????s means to acquire the strongest signal. After the research had concluded and the propulsors failed to yield desired results, many factors were considered to rationalize the observations. The operating frequency was reduced, and it was found that, by the impulse-momentum theorem, that the propulsive force was reduced proportionally. The literature surveyed addressed undulatory motion, which produces constant propulsive force, not oscillatory, which <b>yields</b> <b>intermittent</b> propulsive force. These reasons among others were produced to rationalize the results and prove the cause of negative results was inherent to the actuators themselves. All rational options have been considered to yield positive results...|$|R

The primary outcome was gender differences regarding the change in absolute claudication distance (ACD) after SET. ACD was defined as the number of meters that a patient had covered just before he or she was forced to stop walking because of intolerable pain. Secondary outcomes were gender differences in change of functional walking distance, quality of life, and walking (dis) ability after SET. Walking distances were obtained by standardized treadmill testing according to the Gardner-Skinner protocol. Quality of life was measured by the 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey, and walking (dis) ability was determined by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). Measurements were performed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Only patients who met the 12 -month follow-up measure were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 113 men and 56 women were available for analysis. At baseline, groups were similar in terms of clinical characteristics and ACD walking distances (men, 250 meters; women, 270 meters; P =. 45). ACD improved for both sexes. However, ACD increase was significantly lower for women than for men during the first 3 months of SET (Delta 280 meters for men vs Delta 220 meters for women; P =. 04). Moreover, absolute walking distance was significantly shorter for women compared with men after 1 year (565 meters vs 660 meters; P =. 032). Women also reported less on several WIQ subdomains, although total WIQ score was similar (0. 69 for men vs 0. 61 for women; P =. 592). No differences in quality of life after SET were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Women with IC benefit less during the first 3 months of SET and have lower absolute walking distances after 12 months of follow-up compared with men. More {{research is needed to determine}} whether gender-based IC treatment strategies are required...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on {{photosynthesis}} in intermittent light {{have been}} made on two occasions. Brown and Escombe, in 1905, made use of a rotating sector to study the effect of light intensity on the photosynthesis of leaves. They found three-quarters of the light from a given source could be cut out in each revolution of the sector without decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. Willstätter (1918, p. 240) explains that this was {{probably due to the}} low concentration of carbon dioxide available for the leaves. The short periods of light would be sufficient to reduce all the carbon dioxide which could reach the cells by diffusion during the dark periods. In 1919 - 20 Warburg made experiments on Chlorella similar to those of Brown and Escombe on leaves. Instead of stating his results as amount of photosynthesis per total elapsed time, as Brown and Escombe did, he gave photosynthesis per total time during which the cells were illuminated. Since he used sectors which cut out half the incident light in each revolution, the time during which the cells were illuminated was always half of the elapsed time of an experiment. Working with a high intensity of light and a high concentration of carbon dioxide, Warburg found that a given amount of light reduced more carbon dioxide when allowed to fall on the cells intermittently than when allowed to fall on them continuously. The improvement in the <b>yield</b> of the <b>intermittent</b> over the <b>yield</b> in continuous light depended on the frequency of the flashing. With a frequency of four periods per minute the improvement was 10 per cent, and with a frequency of 8000 per minute it was 100 per cent. Warburg proposed two alternative explanations for the improvement in the <b>yield</b> of the <b>intermittent</b> light. Either the reduction of carbon dioxide continues in the dark, or it proceeds twice as fast during the brief light flash as during the same length of time in continuous light. He considers the latter explanation more likely, and assumes that certain steps in the photosynthetic process continue in the dark until a dark equilibrium is reached. After the dark period a short flash of light would find a higher concentration of reactive substance ready for it than is available in continuous light, and would be able to effect more decomposition than an equal amount of continuous light. The experiments described in this paper indicate, we think, that the steps in photosynthesis which proceed in the dark involve what has hitherto been known as the Blackman reaction. Probably the reduction of carbon dioxide is not completed during the photochemical part of the process. A more correct way of representing the sequence of events in intermittent light would be as follows. Two steps are involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide: a reaction in which light is absorbed, followed by a reaction not requiring light [...] the so called Blackman reaction. If the light intensity is high the photochemical reaction is capable of proceeding at great speed, but in continuous light it can go no faster than the Blackman reaction. We suppose that the product formed in the photochemical reaction is converted to some other substance by the Blackman reaction, {{and at the same time}} the chlorophyll is set free to take part again in the photochemical reaction. If a green cell is illuminated, we think that the photochemical reaction proceeds rapidly until an equilibrium concentration of its product is formed. After this the photochemical reaction proceeds only as fast as the Blackmail reaction removes the intermediate product. If the cell is now darkened, the photochemical reaction stops at once, but the Blackman reaction continues until its raw material, the product formed by the photochemical reaction, is exhausted. After this nothing further happens until the cell is again illuminated. Higher efficiency of the light would be obtained if each light flash lasted only long enough to build up the equilibrium concentration of the intermediate product, and each dark period were long enough to allow the Blackman reaction time to use up all the intermediate product present at the moment the light period ended. In Warburg's flicker experiments the light and dark periods were always of equal length. He found that the amount of work done by the light could be increased by shortening both the light and the dark periods. This indicates that his light periods were too long for maximum efficiency. In the latter part of each light period the photochemical reaction must have been brought down to near the speed of the Blackman reaction. Using 133 light flashes per second, Warburg obtained an improvement of 100 per cent over the continuous light yield. We were able to improve the continuous light yield 300 per cent to 400 per cent by using only 50 flashes per second and making the light flashes much shorter than the dark periods. This opened the possibility of determining the length of the dark period necessary for the complete removal of the intermediate product formed in a light flash of given intensity and duration. Lengthening the dark period should improve the yield until there is time enough for all the intermediate product formed in each light flash to be removed before the next light flash. In this paper we describe experiments which show that the necessary dark time is about 0. 03 to 0. 4 of a second, depending on the temperature. Further experiments are described to show certain characteristics of the reactions taking place both in the light and in the dark...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{cultivation}} is {{the major}} source of food and cash income for many small-scale farmers in Myanmar, and the most important agricultural crop of the country. It is followed by oilseed crops and pulses ranking second and third most important, respectively. Due to the high diversity of agro-climatic conditions in Myanmar, rice is cultivated in different cropping sequences using suitable cultivation practices under different agro-ecosystems. The rice root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola is an important soil-borne pathogen of rice and can cause a varying degree of yield losses under different agro-ecosystems in South and Southeast Asia. However, no detailed information is presently available on the occurrence of M. graminicola in rice-based production systems under different agro-ecosystems of Myanmar along with the damage and yield losses this nematode can cause. Therefore, in the 1 st part of our study (Chapter 2), two surveys were carried out during 2009. The first survey was during the dry summer season (mid-January to mid-May) in 450 rice fields from ten regions representing the summer-irrigated lowland rice ecosystem in the lower Ayeyarwady River Delta area of Myanmar. The second survey was during the rainy (monsoon) season (mid-May to mid-October) in 102 rice fields from three regions representing the rainfed upland rice ecosystem in the northern hilly area of Myanmar. The two surveys revealed that M. graminicola is unquestionably a major pathogen of the summer-irrigated lowland rice ecosystem in Myanmar. Meloidogyne graminicola was found in 78 % of 450 summer-irrigated lowland rice fields but only 9 % of 102 rainfed upland rice fields. The practice of delayed irrigation and intermittent flooding is the most commonly used practice in the summer-irrigated lowland rice growing area while rainfed upland rice is cultivated in a 2 -year rotation system in the northern hilly area. In lowland rice, M. graminicola was found in 87 % of the delayed irrigated rice fields and 45 % of the early irrigated rice fields. The rice root nematode Hirschmanniella oyzae was detected in only 15 % of the summer-irrigated lowland rice fields. In the 2 nd part of our study (Chapter 3), a study was undertaken from December 2009 until December 2010 in the Ayeyarwady River Delta area, the major lowland rice producing area of Myanmar, to monitor the population dynamics of M. graminicola and H. oryzae in a naturally infested field. Root samples were obtained from two rice varieties, Yatanartoe and Taungpyang, that are commonly cultivated in double rice cropping sequences in Myanmar and that represent a summer-irrigated and a rainfed lowland rice variety, respectively. The results of this study illustrated the remarkable influence of the long rice growing season on the occurrence of these two important rice nematodes. Meloidogyne graminicola could build up high population densities and induce root galling only during the summer-irrigated rice growing season while H. oryzae could build up high population densities only during the monsoon rice growing season. During the summer-irrigated rice growing season the root population density of second-stage juveniles (J 2) of M. graminicola showed two distinct peaks: at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants (10, 056 J 2 /g roots) in January and at the heading stage of the rice plants (13, 923 J 2 /g roots) in March 2010. During the rainfed monsoon rice growing season, the root population density of H. oryzae juveniles and adults showed also two distinct peaks: at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants (176 /g roots) in August and at the heading stage of the rice plants (280 H. oryzae/g roots) in October 2010. In the 3 rd part of our study (Chapter 4), the host response to M. graminicola infection of 15 lowland rice varieties and nine upland rice varieties, which are commonly being grown in the summer-irrigated lowland and rainfed upland rice ecosystems in Myanmar, were evaluated in two experiments under screenhouse conditions. The lowland rice experiment was carried out under intermittently flooded conditions in a clay loam soil (i. e. simulating the summer-irrigated lowland rice ecosystem) and the upland rice experiment was carried out at field capacity in a sandy loam soil (i. e. simulating the monsoon rainfed upland rice ecosystem). Based on the multiplication factors (Mf eggs) at 8 weeks after inoculation (WAI), none of the 15 lowland and nine upland rice varieties were found to be resistant to M. graminicola infection although differences in susceptibility and sensitivity were observed. Six (or 40 %) out of the 15 lowland varieties examined were classified as less susceptible to M. graminicola infection, five (or 33. 3 %) as moderately susceptible while four (or 26. 7 %) as highly susceptible. One (or 11. 1 %) out of the nine upland varieties examined was classified as less susceptible to M. graminicola infection, three (or 33. 3 %) as moderately susceptible while five (or 55. 6 %) as highly susceptible. Five (or 33. 3 %) out of the 15 lowland varieties examined were classified as either less sensitive or tolerant to M. graminicola infection. One (or 11. 1 %) out of the nine upland varieties examined was classified as tolerant to M. graminicola infection based on plant growth variables at 8 WAI. In the 4 th part of our study (Chapter 5), the damage potential and yield loss of M. graminicola infection was investigated on 15 lowland rice varieties under screenhouse conditions and in a naturally-infested farmers field in the Ayeyarwady River Delta area and on nine upland rice varieties under screenhouse conditions. The lowland rice varieties were intermittently flooded in a clay loam soil and the upland rice varieties were maintained at field capacity in a sandy loam soil. The results of these studies confirm that M. graminicola is potentially a very important constraint for rice production in Myanmar. In the screenhouse and the field experiment it reduced the yield of 15 commonly cultivated lowland rice varieties on average with 31. 1 and 16. 5 %, respectively. In the screenhouse experiment with nine commonly cultivated upland rice varieties it caused a 44. 9 % yield reduction. All rice varieties examined, except one upland variety (Khaukphephan), were highly sensitive to M. graminicola. This part of our study also confirms the results of the host response study in Chapter 4 that upland rice varieties are more susceptible and sensitive to M. graminicola compared with lowland rice varieties. In the 5 th part of our study (Chapter 6), two screenhouse experiments were carried out. The first to evaluate the effects of three water regimes (permanent flooding, intermittent flooding, upland) on the damage and yield loss potential of M. graminicola on a commonly cultivated lowland (Thihtatyin) and upland (Kone Myint 2) rice variety in two soil types (clay loam and sandy loam). The second to evaluate the effects of two irrigation (early irrigation and delayed irrigation) and two planting (direct seeding and transplanting) practices on the damage and yield loss potential of M. graminicola on two commonly cultivated lowland rice varieties (Thihtatyin and Yatanartoe). In the first experiment, no significant effects were observed of any of the water regimes on the population densities of M. graminicola of both rice varieties in both soil types with exception of the higher number of J 2 /g roots of the variety Kone Myint 2 under upland conditions compared with permanent flooding (11, 013 vs 2, 336 J 2 /g roots) in the sandy loam soil. Based on the multiplication factors (Mf eggs), the effect of water regime on the population density of M. graminicola is influenced by the soil type in which the rice plants are grown but this effect can vary among rice varieties. Less root galling severity was observed under permanent flooding in both soil types (clay loam and sandy loam). Tolerance of both rice varieties was observed under permanent flooding in the clay loam soil. However, the grain yield of the variety Kone Myint 2 was reduced by M. graminicola in the sandy loam soil under all water regimes including permanent flooding (38. 7 %). Under <b>intermittent</b> flooding, grain <b>yield</b> reduction was 21. 9 % on the variety Thihtatyin and 45. 2 % on the variety Kone Myint 2 in the clay loam soil while grain yield reductions higher than 70 % on both varieties were observed in the sandy loam soil. Under upland conditions, grain yield reduction was 24. 1 % for the variety Thihtatyin and 57. 9 % for the variety Kone Myint 2 in the clay loam soil while grain yield reductions higher than 90 % were observed on both varieties in the sandy loam soil. In the second experiment, both rice varieties were less susceptible in direct seeded rice that had been early irrigated. For both varieties, the highest Mf eggs were observed in transplanted plants that had been delayedirrigated. For both varieties, the highest number of J 2 and eggs per root unit and per root system, and on Mf eggs were observed in transplanted plants compared with direct seeded plants irrespective of irrigation practice. The highest root galling index (7. 4) was observed on transplanted delayed irrigated plants of the variety Thihtatyin while the lowest root galling index (1. 8) was observed on direct seeded early irrigated plants of the variety Yatanartoe. Reduction in most of the plant growth and yield variables measured caused by M. graminicola was observed in transplanted plants of both rice varieties grown under delayed irrigation. Tolerance of both rice varieties was observed in direct seeded rice that had been early irrigated. The variety Yatanartoe was more tolerant than the variety Thihtatyin. For the variety Yatanartoe, grain yield loss caused by M. graminicola was observed only in transplanted rice that had been delayed irrigated (30. 8 %). For the variety Thihtatyin, grain yield loss was observed in both direct seeded rice and|$|R
