In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors.

5|$|As {{referenced}} in {{the larger}} ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended Margaret Sanger's right to educate the general public about forms of birth control. In 1980, the Project filed Poe v.

In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v.

In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked <b>for</b> <b>educating</b> about sexuality and AIDS. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v.

5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience.

Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E

30|$|SDI metrics at the {{national}} level are reported under, respectively, the second, third, and fourth major column headings of Table 1. So, why did the wages of educated workers decline relative to the wages of uneducated workers in rural India? First off, there was a substantial increase in relative supply of educated workers spread rather evenly across the two sub-periods. Thus, we see that the relative supply of educated men rose by 0.50 log points (or 50 %) from 1993 – 1994 to 2004 – 2005 and again by 0.41 log points from 2004 – 2005 to 2011 – 2012; the corresponding figures <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> women are 0.82 and 0.70, respectively. Meanwhile, relative demand <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> workers fell, especially for males (by 0.29 log points in the earlier period and 0.37 log points in the later period). And, finally, there were modest declines in the institutions index <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> relative to uneducated workers. In other words, uneducated workers moved out of (low-paid) agricultural labor faster than educated workers. Similar, but less pronounced, patterns are seen <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> vs. uneducated workers in urban India (rows 6 and 7).|$|R

In 1998, these lengths were reduced to 12 months for non-educated conscripts and 6 months <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> ones. After 2001, the current length of service {{was introduced}}, with a bar on further reductions until 2024.|$|R

40|$|Cross {{sectional}} {{evidence shows}} that foreign firms have a more educated workforce and pay higher wages than domestic firms. These results do not necessarily imply that foreign direct investment translates into higher demand <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> workers or higher wages, however, since foreign investment may be guided by unobservable firm-characteristics correlated with the demand <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> workers or wages. Using firm-level panel data for Portugal, I seek to isolate the effect of foreign direct investment on the demand <b>for</b> <b>educated</b> workers and wages by observing labor demand and wages of different education groups {{before and after the}} foreign acquisition. I find that foreigners 'cherry pick' domestic firms to be acquired, choosing those firms with a more educated workforce. Moreover, these firms are already very similar to the group of existing foreign firms and, following the foreign acquisition, there are no significant changes in the workforce educational composition. There is evidence that average wages increase following the foreign acquisition but changes are smaller than in cross sectional estimates...|$|R
