25|$|In a {{barotropic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the case}} of {{advection}} turning, when there is a cross-isothermal component of the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind,</b> a sharpening of the temperature gradient results. Thermal wind causes a deformation field and frontogenesis may occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E

Upwelling estimates derived from <b>geostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> using the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory (PFEL) technique were compared to those derived from both satellite-measured winds and modelderived winds.

25|$|A {{horizontal}} {{temperature gradient}} exists while moving North-South along a meridian because {{curvature of the}} Earth allows for more solar heating at the equator than at the poles. This creates a westerly <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> pattern to form in the mid-latitudes. Because thermal wind causes an increase in wind velocity with height, the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the tropopause, creating a strong wind current known as the jet stream. The Northern and Southern Hemispheres exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the mid-latitudes.|$|E
25|$|The term {{thermal wind}} is often {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view the thermal wind as a <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> that varies with height, so that the term wind seems appropriate. In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the thermal wind relation and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, the thermal wind relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the thermal wind moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a clarification to that effect.|$|E

[...] Compared to over water, maximum sustained winds over land average 8% lower. [...] More specifically, over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction is between 10% and 30%.|$|E
500|$|Wind {{flows from}} areas of high {{pressure}} to areas of low pressure. [...] This {{is due to}} density {{differences between the two}} air masses.

[...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by the Earth's rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). [...] Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction.

40|$|The Arctic surface {{circulation}} simulated by atmospheric {{general circulation}} models is assessed {{in the context}} of driving sea ice motion. A sea ice model is forced by <b>geostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> from eight models participating in the first Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP 1), and the results are compared to simulations with the sea ice model forced by observed winds. The mean sea level pressure in the AMIP models is generally too high over the Arctic Ocean, except in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, where it is too low. This pattern creates anomalous winds that tend to transport too much ice away from the coast of Greenland and the Canadian Archipalego, and into the East Siberian Sea, producing a pattern of ice thickness in the Arctic that is rotated by roughly 1808 relative to what is expected based on observations. AMIP winds also drive too little ice transport through Fram Strait and too much transport east of Svalbard by way of the Barents Sea. These errors in ice thickness and transport influence ice growth and melt rates and hence the freshwater flux into the ocean. Sensitivity experiments that test the model response to the wind composition show the ice thickness patterns depend primarily on the climatological mean annual cycle of the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>winds.</b> Daily wind variability is necessary to create sufficient ice deformation and open water, but the sea ice behavior is rather insensitive to the details of the daily variations. 1...|$|R
