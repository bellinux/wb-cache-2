25|$|<b>Fugacity</b> {{coefficients}} are dimensionless and can {{be obtained}} experimentally at specific temperature and pressure, from measurements of deviations from ideal gas behaviour. Equilibrium constants are {{defined in terms of}} <b>fugacity.</b> If the gases are at sufficiently low pressure that they behave as ideal gases, the equilibrium constant can be defined as a quotient of partial pressures.|$|E
40|$|CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) {{algorithms}} {{based on}} Gibbs sampling can achieve throughput optimality if certain parameters called the <b>fugacities</b> are appropriately chosen. However, {{the problem of}} computing these <b>fugacities</b> is NP-hard. In this work, we derive estimates of the <b>fugacities</b> by using a framework called the regional free energy approximations. In particular, we derive explicit expressions for approximate <b>fugacities</b> corresponding to any feasible service rate vector. We further prove that our approximate <b>fugacities</b> are exact for the class of chordal graphs. A distinguishing feature of our work is that the regional approximations that we propose are tailored to conflict graphs with small cycles, which is a typical characteristic of wireless networks. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} <b>fugacities</b> obtained by the proposed method are quite accurate and significantly outperform the existing Bethe approximation based techniques.

40|$|We {{consider}} a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) based scheduling algorithm for a single-hop wireless network under a realistic Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) {{model for the}} interference. We propose two local optimization based approximation algorithms to efficiently estimate certain attempt rate parameters of CSMA called <b>fugacities.</b> It is known that adaptive CSMA can achieve throughput optimality by sampling feasible schedules from a Gibbs distribution, with appropriate <b>fugacities.</b> Unfortunately, obtaining these optimal <b>fugacities</b> is an NP-hard problem. Further, the existing adaptive CSMA algorithms use a stochastic gradient descent based method, which usually entails an impractically slow (exponential {{in the size of}} the network) convergence to the optimal <b>fugacities.</b> To address this issue, we first propose an algorithm to estimate the <b>fugacities,</b> that can support a given set of desired service rates. The convergence rate and the complexity of this algorithm are independent of the network size, and depend only on the neighborhood size of a link. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm corresponds exactly to performing the well-known Bethe approximation to the underlying Gibbs distribution. Then, we propose another local algorithm to estimate the optimal <b>fugacities</b> under a utility maximization framework, and characterize its accuracy. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods have a good degree of accuracy, and achieve extremely fast convergence to near-optimal <b>fugacities,</b> and often outperform the convergence rate of the stochastic gradient descent by a few orders of magnitude.

25|$|In {{finding the}} {{equilibrium}} state, a geochemical modeler solves for {{the distribution of}} mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the activity, activity coefficient, and concentration of aqueous species, the saturation state of minerals, and the <b>fugacity</b> of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero {{are said to be}} in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed supersaturated, indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.|$|E
25|$|Sorosilicates, also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, {{which results}} in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The {{resultant}} common structural element is the 6− group. The most common disilicates by far {{are members of the}} epidote group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to metapelites. Epidotes are built around the structure 10− structure; for example, the mineral species epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca2Al2(Fe3+, Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe3+ and Fe2+ helps understand oxygen <b>fugacity,</b> which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.|$|E

50|$|Terrestrial {{igneous rocks}} {{commonly}} record crystallization at oxygen <b>fugacities</b> more oxidizing than the WM (wüstite-magnetite) buffer and more reduced than a log unit or so above the nickel-nickel oxide (NiNiO) buffer. Their oxidizing conditions thus are {{not far from}} those of the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) redox buffer. Nonetheless, there are systematic differences that correlate with tectonic setting. Igneous rock emplaced and erupted in island arcs typically record oxygen <b>fugacities</b> 1 or more log units more oxidizing than those of the NiNiO buffer. In contrast, basalt and gabbro in non-arc settings typically record oxygen <b>fugacities</b> from about those of the FMQ buffer to a log unit or so more reducing than that buffer.|$|R

Thermodynamic parameters at chemical freeze-out (temperature and baryon and strangeness <b>fugacities)</b> are obtained from appropriate fits, generally improving in quality for reactions subjected to centrality cuts.

2500|$|An aqueous {{system is}} uniquely defined by its {{chemical}} composition, temperature, and pressure. [...] Creating geochemical models of such systems begins by choosing the basis, {{the set of}} aqueous species, minerals, and gases which are used to write chemical reactions and express composition. The number of basis entries required equals the number of components in the system, which is fixed by the phase rule of thermodynamics. Typically, the basis is composed of water, each mineral in equilibrium with the system, each gas at known <b>fugacity,</b> and important aqueous species. Once the basis is defined, a modeler can solve for the equilibrium state, which is described by mass action and mass balance equations for each component.|$|E

60|$|The world being thus {{put under}} the mind for verb and noun, the poet is he who can {{articulate}} it. For though life is great, and fascinates, and absorbs; and though {{all men are}} intelligent of the symbols through which it is named; yet they cannot originally use them. We are symbols and inhabit symbols; workmen, work, and tools, words and things, birth and death, all are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols, and being infatuated with the economical uses of things, {{we do not know}} that they are thoughts. The poet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives them a power which makes their old use forgotten, and puts eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate object. He perceives the independence of the thought on the symbol, the stability of the thought, the accidency and <b>fugacity</b> of the symbol. As the eyes of Lyncaeus were said to see through the earth, so the poet turns the world to glass, and shows us all things in their right series and procession. For through that better perception he stands one step nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form; and following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature. All the facts of the animal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth, are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man, to suffer there a change and reappear a new and higher fact. He uses forms according to the life, and not according to the form. This is true science. The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation and animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as signs. He knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars; why the great deep is adorned with animals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought.|$|E

Similar measurements {{have been made}} of the type A and B spinel peridotites from San Carlos in Arizona. The type A peridotites are characterised by oxygen <b>fugacities</b> close to the iron-wüstite buffer, similar to those of equivalent peridotite specimens from other continental and island arc environments. In strong contrast, the type B peridotites and all of the ilmenite megacrysts range between the oxygen <b>fugacities</b> defined by the nickelnickel oxide and fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffers. A close relationship between type B peridotites, oxidized metasomatizing fluids in the upper mantle and oxidized, silicaundersaturated magma types is suggested. It is unlikely that a solid elemental carbon phase can be an equilibrium crystallization product of kimberlite magmas if the ilmenite megacrysts represent the redox state of kimberlite melts. The ultimate source of the oxidizing fluids and the development of such a wide dispersion (> 4 orders of magnitude) in oxygen <b>fugacities</b> of the upper mantle is not clear, but may involve recycled lithosphere, fluids from the lower mantle or result from the relatively rapid diffusion of H 2, compared with other potential volatile species, in the mantle...|$|R
