25|$|One {{major issue}} with the Act was that fire {{certification}} was only ever applied to the designated premises.

25|$|Before 1947, {{issues of}} fire safety {{were in the}} hands of the local authority, and the legal {{enforcement}} of issues under the Factories Act and Office Shops and Railway Premises Act were dealt with by the local authority, having usually devolved this down to the fire brigade. The introduction of the Fire Services Act 1947 gave the fire brigade its first responsibilities for fire safety. Section 1 of the Fire Services Act defined the duties of a fire brigade and further went to say under section 1, sub-section 1 paragraph F, commonly referred to as 11(F), that a fire brigade must give advice and assistance on matters of fire prevention if so requested by any person. The Act did not however give any other powers to the fire brigade in terms of <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} considers {{structures and}} practices of regulatory <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement,</b> <b>and</b> particularly the relevance and effects of purported “smarter inspections” methods, e. g. risk-based ones, and how they compare with previously existing practices.

The first part considers the history of regulatory <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> how specific <b>inspection</b> institutions started to appear from the 19 th century onwards. Of particular interest is how path dependency resulted in important differences in structures and methods between different fields and countries, and how these in turn produced different effects for the public.

[...] "Mining operations at the Sago Mine more than doubled between 2004 and 2005, and the injury rate was significantly above the national average. This prompted MSHA to dramatically increase—by 84%—its on-site <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> presence. As a result, MSHA also took significantly more enforcement actions—208 in total—against Sago Mine in 2005, requiring the operator to quickly correct health and safety violations in accordance with federal Mine Act standards." [...] Davitt McAteer, MSHA chief during the Clinton administration told The Gazette, [...] "The numbers don’t sound good.... sufficiently high that it should tip off management that there is something amiss here.

40|$|Abstract: This {{empirical}} study {{analyzes the}} effect of corporate environmental performance on financial performance in a transition economy. In particular, it assesses whether good environmental performance affects profits, and if so, in which direction. Then the study decomposes profits into revenues and costs {{in order to identify}} the channel(s) of any identified effect of environmental performance on profits. For example, as environmental performance improves, do revenues rise and costs fall so that profits increase? For this assessment, our study analyzes the links from environmental performance to revenues, costs, and profits using an unbalanced panel of Czech firms from the years 1996 to 1998. The empirical results indicate strongly and robustly that better environmental performance improves profitability by driving down costs more than it drives down revenues. The strong reduction in costs is consistent with the substantial regulatory scrutiny exerted by environmental agencies during the sample period in the forms of prevalent monitoring (i. e., <b>inspections)</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> escalating emission charge rates...|$|R
