40|$|The Menderes era can be {{seen the}} first birth for the modern Turkey. The reason is that all {{political}} and economic policies implemented in this period were completely adverse of the previous era (the Inonu era). Nevertheless, structural economic insufficiencies also brought {{the end of this}} period. Turkey started to experience a long wasteful <b>expenditure</b> <b>period</b> with the planned era after 1963. This intended wasteful <b>expenditure</b> <b>period</b> lasted until 1977. The second critical time period for modern Turkey started with 1980. January 24 Decisions has changed deeply the development strategy carried out until that day. This second strategy almost reached its limits in 1988. With economic crises in 1994 and 2000, Turkey has seen two big traumas. To cope with economic fluctuations, Turkey has strengthened its long term EU membership policy and IMF-supported economic policy. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} topics of the defense {{economics}} literature regarding Turkey and Greece has been the empirical modeling of various aspects of arms racing. However, despite {{a considerable amount of}} research, little evidence has been found in favor of an arms race between the two countries. In the literature, this failure of applied studies has been attributed, among other reasons, to the sensitivity of the results to the underlying model specification, to small sample size, and to measurement issues. This study uses novel, nonlinear, models to investigate the possible relationship between the military expenditures of the two countries. It is assumed that if there are two regimes characterizing the low (or negative) and high-growth military <b>expenditure</b> <b>periods,</b> the growth rates of one country's military expenditure may have distinct effects on the military expenditure regimes of the other country or may contribute to the change from one regime to another. The nonlinear models examined are Smooth Transition Regression models (STRs). Strong evidence of nonlinearity for Greece is found, with asymmetry relating to two distinct regimes through lagged Turkish military expenditure changes.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dynamic interrelationship between total expenditures, own source revenues, grants {{received}} {{from state and}} loans in Finnish municipalities. Two separate panel data sets that cover the years 1985 - 1992 for matching grants period and 1993 - 1999 for formula based grant period are used for all municipalities. The analysis is done using the VAR method for panel data. I find, first, that there are important dynamic interrelationships between the variables in question. Second, I find that during the matching grants <b>period,</b> <b>expenditures</b> Granger-cause revenues uni-directionally, whereas during the formula based grants system the revenues and expenditures Granger-cause each other. The grants Granger-cause <b>expenditures</b> during both <b>periods.</b> In {{the end of the}} 1990 s municipalities have been able to pay off their loans primarily by cutting expenditures and not by increasing own source revenues.

5000|$|If {{one needs}} matched {{quantity}} and price indexes {{they can be}} calculated directly from these equations, {{but it is more}} common to compute a price index by dividing total <b>expenditure</b> each <b>period</b> by the quantity index so the resulting indexes multiply out to total expenditure. This approach is called the indirect way of calculating a Törnqvist index, [...] and it generates numbers that are not exactly the same as a direct calculation. There is research on which method to use based partly on whether price changes or quantity changes are more volatile. For multifactor productivity calculations, the indirect method is used.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing the 1996 Canadian Food Expenditure survey {{matched with}} Canadian Nutrient File, we {{separate}} actual food consumption from observed expenditure {{and test the}} Permanent Income/Life Cycle Hypothesis on the true consumption data. We find that the lower food <b>expenditure</b> during <b>periods</b> of unemployment or retirement (previously reported in the literature), does not translate into poorer nutrition. Household calorie intake and major nutrient intake seem to be unaffected by changes in employment status. We find evidence that unemployed or retired households substitute food purchased from restaurants for food purchased for at home consumption. Further, with the 1998 Time Use Survey we find that individuals who are not employed devote more time for food preparation. Finally we present limited evidence that unemployed and retired households substitute precooked meals for meals made from primary ingredients. Food Production, Nutrition, Consumption Smoothing...|$|R
