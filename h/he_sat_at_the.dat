25|$|While the {{identity}} of 'Gil Sambong' remained a mystery, a group of Westerners claimed that Choe Yeonggyeong, an influential scholar of Jeonju and a major Easterner, was 'Gil Sambong', because <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> highest seat in an archery practice held by the Daedonggye. Choe was brought before Seonjo, where he claimed {{that he had never}} had any form of connection with Jeong Yeorip. Both Seonjo and Jeong Cheol thought Choe was not 'Gil Sambong'. However, Westerner pressure forced Seonjo to continue the torture of Choe. Choe died of torture in 1590.|$|E
25|$|A noted {{figure on}} Bucharest's bohemian scene, the painter frequented the artistic-literary club at Casa Capșa restaurant. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same table {{with some of}} the modernist and neo-traditionalist writers (Camil Baltazar, Liviu Rebreanu, Vasile Voiculescu, Ilarie Voronca), and, story goes, was once caught up in a cake fight with the satirist and prankster Păstorel Teodoreanu. Sion {{satisfied}} public expectations with portraits of the Bucharest upper middle class and proposed a design for the Vasile Alecsandri Mausoleum. He lost the latter commission to Paul Molda—reportedly, Sion preserved a bitter grudge against the Romanian Academy, who had ruled against him in this matter.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Senate in 1987, McCain kept a low profile.

500|$|In 1998, Ray said, [...] "I'd written 'You Really Got Me' as {{tribute to}} all those great blues people I love: Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy." [...] Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, [...] "Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in , and as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano at home, he sort of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan {{and came up with}} this figure based on a 12-bar blues". Dave has also said that song had been {{inspired}} by Jimmy Giuffre's song [...] "The Train and the River".

Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band's [...] "first serious female fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The men sprayed {{the lobby}} with gunfire upon entering. The first victim was {{maintenance}} worker Frédéric Boisseau, {{who was killed}} as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reception desk. The gunmen forced Rey at gunpoint to lead them to a second-floor office, where 15 staff members were having an editorial meeting, Charlie Hebdos first news conference of the year. Reporter Laurent Léger said they were interrupted by {{what they thought was}} the sound of a firecracker—the gunfire from the lobby—and recalled, [...] "We still thought it was a joke. The atmosphere was still joyous." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> telegram, {{his mouth}} open. His friend eyed him solicitously.|$|R
60|$|Father Cullen's misfortunes {{still did}} not come home to Macdermot; <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|R
60|$|The remark was {{unpleasant}} in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
60|$|One day, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window {{fully dressed}} for the fourth of fifth time, William McTurg came up the walk.|$|E
60|$|At supper <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table with}} the men, whose wet shirts showed how fierce the work of {{pitching}} the hay had been.|$|E
60|$|Andrew went on deck, {{and after}} {{weighing}} anchor and making sail <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm, lost in disturbing thought, while the Rowan stood up-channel.|$|E
60|$|The florid woman {{brought him}} a chair, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, as Endicott once more began to deal.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{moved away}} from her. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table and {{buried his face in}} his hands. He felt dreadfully humiliated.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table again, {{and taking}} up his pen took some papers from a pigeon-hole and eyed them with severe thoughtfulness.|$|R
6000|$|Link {{caught him}} by the {{shoulder}} as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> desk. Sanford's tone enraged him. [...] "You thief! But you'll pay me back, or I'll-" ...|$|E
6000|$|When we got fairly out, our sail filled, {{and we went}} {{scudding}} away on a good wind. Then said old Menendez, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tiller: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the pit, where the great drops of water fell plash. Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up, talking noisily. Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, and, {{squaring}} his shoulders, took a noisy dip of ink, and {{scratching his}} head, looked pensively <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
60|$|The {{carpenter}} {{knew nothing}} about being ill; he only thought that he wanted something to eat, so <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table and began his dinner.|$|R

60|$|He {{thought of}} her as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table with George and his aged mother. They lived alone, and their lives were curiously silent. Once in a while a low-voiced question, and that was all.|$|E
60|$|He {{wrote out}} a cheque. Miss Hyslop drew {{a sigh of}} relief as she laid it on one side with the envelope. Then she swung round in her chair to face him where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writing-table.|$|E
60|$|The {{king was}} overjoyed by her words, and from {{early in the}} morning till late at night <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window and looked {{carefully}} at all the passers-by, in the hopes of finding a son-in-law among them.|$|E
60|$|Hayes made {{a warning}} gesture, there were {{steps in the}} passage, and Osborn came in. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the table}} and looked at his watch.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy’s {{heart sank}} as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{shivering}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm while the bitter spray whirled {{about him and}} the sloop lurched on through the darkness, chased by foaming seas.|$|R
60|$|He {{stumbled}} {{and went with}} difficulty. He could go no further among these rocks and ravines, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of a tree to wait for day.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{head of his}} {{handsome}} table that night Curtis began to appreciate his comforts. He forgot the dissensions and jealousies, the cynical speculations and the bitter rivalries of the officers--he remembered only the pleasant things.|$|E
6000|$|He {{kept the}} boy waiting ten minutes, and then wrote the reply: [...] "Impossible to leave here at present." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window again {{and let the}} city put its cup of {{mandragora}} to his lips again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{top of a}} {{long table}} covered with flowers and filled with guests. And beside him sat the empress, {{supported}} by twelve cushions. When the princes entered one of the cushions fell down, and there remained only eleven.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening as}} <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> tea, <b>the</b> maid {{came with the}} {{announcement}} {{that there was a}} person in the reception-room who would not send in any name, but wished to see Mr. Sewell, and would wait.|$|R
60|$|We silently {{observed}} him as <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> {{still looking}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|R
60|$|The captain made no reply. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> appalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way {{in which}} the old lady was using him to pay off some of the debt that she fancied was due to Mrs. Chinnery.|$|R
