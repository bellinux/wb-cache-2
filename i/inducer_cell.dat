40|$|We have {{described}} {{an interaction between}} two T cells subsets that results in interference with the expression of Ly- 1 -, 2 + (Ly- 2) T cell- mediated suppression. We refer to this novel immunoregulatory activity as contrasuppression. The T cell responsible for the induction of contrasuppression (<b>inducer</b> <b>cell)</b> expresses the phenotype Ly- 1 -, 2 +;I- J+;Qa- 1 +. This phenotype distinguishes it from the suppressor effector cells which we find to be I-J- 2. 3. An I-J+ soluble mediator from the contrasuppressor <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> acts on another cell (acceptor cell) that expresses the phenotype Ly- 1 +, 2 +; I-J+; Qa- 1 +. This phenotype distinguishes it from T helper cells. Both the <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> (or its biologically active mediator) and its acceptor cell are required {{for the expression of}} contrasuppression. Because contrasuppressor cells can block the suppressive activity of cell-free mediators released by Ly- 2 suppressor T cells, the mechanism of contrasuppression is either separated from or in addition to the inactivation of suppressor cells themselves. The potential importance of contrasuppressor activity in the regulation of suppressor T cell activity in allowing immunologic memory to be expressed and in permitting microenvironmental immune regulation is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of genetic}} tools, imaging {{technologies}} and ex vivo culture systems has provided significant {{insights into the}} role of tissue inducer cells and associated signalling pathways in the formation and function of lymphoid organs. Despite advances in experimental technologies, the molecular and cellular process orchestrating the formation of a complex 3 -dimensional tissue is difficult to dissect using current approaches. Therefore, a robust set of simulation tools have been developed to model the processes involved in lymphoid tissue development. Specifically the role of different tissue <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> populations in the dynamic formation of Peyer's Patches has been examined. Utilising approaches from critical systems engineering an unbiased model of lymphoid tissue <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> function has been developed, that permits the development of emerging behaviours that are statistically not different from that observed in vivo. These results provide the confidence to utilise statistical methods to explore how the simulator predicts cellular behaviour and outcomes under different physiological conditions. Such methods, known as sensitivity analysis techniques, can provide insight into when a component part of the system (such as a particular cell type, adhesion molecule, or chemokine) begins to have an influence on observed behaviour, and quantifies the effect a component part has on the end result: the formation of lymphoid tissue. Through use of such a principled approach in the design, calibration, and analysis of a computer simulation, a robust in silico tool can be developed which can both further the understanding of a biological system being explored, and act as a tool for the generation of hypotheses which can be tested utilising experimental approaches...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is evaluation of electromagnetic effects on viability of Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) without co-culturing. In this study, stem cells were isolated from human adipose tissue enzymatically and proliferated in monolayer culture. Then, 5. (10 ^ 4) adipose-derived stem cells were cultured in each well of the test plate. In the first row (4 wells), ADSCs as <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured in DMEM 1 with 10 ng/ml Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In adjacent and the last rows, ADSCs were cultured without FGF (as detector cells). After the three and five days the viability of cells were evaluated. Moreover, ADSCs were cultured in the same conditions but the <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> were placed once in the UV-filter tube and once in the quartz tube to see whether there is electromagnetic interaction among <b>cells.</b> <b>Inducer</b> <b>cells</b> caused significant cell proliferation in adjacent row cells (p- value< 0. 01) in the fifth day. However, using the UV-filter tube and quartz tube both reduced the effect of <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> on adjacent cells significantly. As a conclusion, we could detect distant cellular interaction (DCI) among adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), but it was not electromagnetic signaling. Our results show that ADSCs affect each other via volatile signaling as a chemical distant cellular interaction (CDCI). Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|R

This initial burst of mRNA synthesis is paralleled by synthesis and secretion {{of a family}} of polypeptides that mediate <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> activity, including T- and B-cell growth factors, interferon, and molecules that bind to antigen. Expression of this initial genetic program precedes mitosis and is replaced within 74 hr by a different genetic program, which may control further cell division.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibody}} response of spleen cells from B 10 strain mice is not suppressed by factor preparations made by primed Ly- 2 T cells, although these preparations can suppress the in vitro antibody response of spleen cells from other mouse strains (1 - 3) 2. The factor preparations from Ly- 2 cells contain {{at least two}} separable activities: one {{that acts as a}} suppressor moiety (Ly- 2 T cell suppressor factor [Ly- 2 TsF]) and a second factor that acts as an inducer of contrasuppression (Ly- 2 TcsiF); the latter initiates a series of cellular interactions that leads to the inhibition of suppression that we refer to as contrasuppression. Removal of components (either cellular or humoral) of the contrasuppressor circuit makes spleen cells from B 10 strain mice as easily suppressible as are those of other mouse strains. Thus, removal of the contrasuppressor <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> and/or its biologically active product with the use of an anit-J serum, or removal of the functional acceptor of the <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> with the same or other (Ly- 2; Qa- 1) antisera breaks the B 10 suppressor barrier. Contrasuppressive activity. but not helper activity can be eluted from anit-I-J immunoabsorbents. The addition of B 10 T cells to either B 6 or B 10 spleen cell culture deprived of acceptor cells for the TcsiF reconstitutes contrasuppression more efficiently than does the addition of C 57 BL/ 6 T cells. Ly- 2 TcsiF is more cross-reactive than is Ly- 2 TsF so that absorption of factor preparations from sheep erythrocyte-primed Ly- 2 cells with horse erythrocytes also breaks the B 10 suppressor barrier. The hyperresponsiveness of splenic T cells from B 10 strains to Ly- 2 TcsiF may be an in vitro exaggeration of a normal in vivo process. Thus it is possible that one can take advantage of this unusual situation to help dissect out the cellular and subcellular components of T cell circuits that moldulate sensitivity to immunoregulatory signals...|$|E

40|$|Mitogen- or antigen-activated murine spleen and thymus cell blasts {{have been}} used as <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> to stimulate {{production}} of suppressor T cells (Ts) in autologous mixed leucocyte culture. Ts cells were induced in an MHC-restricted fashion and produced suppression of cell-mediated lympholysis and antibody synthesis from fresh spleen cells sharing MHC haplotypes with the Ts pool. Ts were Thy 1 +, Lyt 1 + cells. Induction of Ts depended upon expression of class II MHC antigens on stimulating cells, but the level of Ts induced by different populations of suppressor <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> was not correlated with the level of Ia antigen expression. Activity of suppressor <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> was correlated with the functional activity of the inducer pool. The data are interpreted to favour a model in which Ts are induced by associative recognition on stimulator cells of class II MHC antigens and lymphocyte recognition receptors as nominal antigen (i. e. Ts are auto anti-idiotypic in nature). Using as stimulator/responder cells in AMLR lymphocytes taken from normal (8 -week) or aged (greater than 24 -month) mice, data were obtained consistent with this model and with earlier evidence for an altered expression of both lymphocyte recognition receptors and/or class II antigens in senescence...|$|R
40|$|Ly- 1 <b>inducer</b> T <b>cells</b> play a {{critical}} role in the regulation of antibody synthesis. One subset of Ly- 1 T <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> (Qa- 1 -) can activate B lymphocytes to secrete IgM (1). A second (Qa- 1 +) stimulates Ly-l, 2 + T cells to differentiate into Ly- 2 + T suppressor cells (1 - 3) that inactivate both subsets of <b>inducer</b> T <b>cells,</b> resulting in reduced levels of antibody formation and suppression. Recent reports (4 - 7) have indicated that T cells can also inhibit antibody responses without induction of Ly- 2 T suppressors. Heterogeneous or cloned Ly- 1 T cells failed to function as T helper (Th) 1 cells and inhibited primary IgM responses. This reflected direct inhibition of B cell maturation into IgM-secreting cells by the Ly-l:Qa- 1 + fraction of <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> (4, 5). The nonhelper Ly- 1 T cell induced B cell proliferation but inhibited primary IgM response to phosphorylcholine-ovalbumin (PC-OVA) : suppression was I-A-restricted and required a hapten-carrier bridge between the B cell and the Ly- 1 T cell clone (5).

Results showed that blocked allogeneic normal cells or blocked Con A-pretreated, normal or irradiated, autochthonous or allogeneic cells served as potent stimuli for suppression of immunoglobulin biosynthesis by normal responder cells, but not by SLE responder cells.

These cells "corecognize " a complex composed of antigen and class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) x products.

A major difficulty has been the use of antigens consisting of peptides or polymers that carry an unknown number and type of determinants that can form immunogenically active complexes with I-A. Production of monoclonal T cells that corecognize a single defined determinant, such as a hapten, in association with class II MHC products allows direct biologic and biochemical definition of this interaction. We therefore developed two series ofT cell clones that recognize the haptens 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl (TNP) and (4 -hydroxy- 3 nitrophenyl) aeetyl (NP).

40|$|AbstractCD 8 + T-cell-mediated {{suppression}} of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) replication {{has been described}} by several groups, although the mechanisms of activation and conditions for viral suppression vary with the methodologies. We have previously reported that CD 8 + T-cell-mediated {{suppression of}} FIV replication required <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> stimulation of the effector cells. The focus {{of the present study was}} to examine the essential role of inducer cells required for the induction of this soluble anti-FIV activity. Both FIV-PPR-infected T cells and feline skin fibroblasts (FSF) infected with an alphavirus vector expressing FIV capsid or the irrelevant antigen lacZ, stimulated autologous or heterologous effector cells to produce supernatants that suppressed FIV replication. Thus, induction of this suppression of FIV replication did not strictly require autologous inducer cells and did not require the presence of FIV antigen. Anti-viral activity correlated with the presence of CD 8 + T cells. Suppression was maximal when the inducer cells and the effector cells were in contact with each other, because separation of the inducer and effector cells by a 0. 45 -μm membrane reduced FIV suppression by approximately 50 %. These findings emphasize the importance for membrane antigen interactions and cytokines in the optimal induction of effector cell synthesis of the soluble anti-FIV activity...|$|E

Finally, we could show that administration of Flt 3 L increased the number of NKp 46 (-) group 3 ILCs in wild-type and even in Il 7 (-/-) mice, which generally have reduced numbers of ILCs.

Ly- 1 cells, obtained from several different priming regimens, were negatively selected with anti-Qa- 1 plus complement and compared with unselected Ly- 1 cells for helper cell activity. Priming isolated T cells on antigen-pulsed macrophages {{in the absence}} of B cells favors the generation of the Ly- 1 :Qa 1 - subset, which is capable of efficient helper activity {{in the absence of}} the Ly- 1 :Qa- 1 + subset. Priming T cells in an environment containing B cells generates both Ly- 1 :Qa- 1 - helper effector cells and Ly- 1 :Qa- 1 + cells which contribute to the helper effect. Whether Ly- 1 :Qa- 1 + cells are capable of independent helper activity cannot be determined, and, as such, Ly- 1 :Qa- 1 + cells are more appropriately termed "help associated" rather than "helper effector.

Apart from the fact that T helper cell activity was found to be less efficient, it appeared that the peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) of patients in an active stage of the disease did not contain the suppressor precursor cells, which functions as the target cell for the inductive signal of T mu+ suppressor <b>inducer</b> <b>cells.</b> The absence of the suppressor precursor cells in SLE patients coincided with the absence of T gamma+ suppressor effector cells. Characterization of the (post-thymic) precursor cells (derived from normal donors) with the aid of monoclonal antibodies of the OKT series and several other markers pointed out that this population contains OKT 4 + as well as OKT 8 + cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the cells are capable of rosetting with autologous erythrocytes, and do not bear Fc receptors for IgM or IgG.

This complex binds to and activates the anti-suppressor effector T cell, which eventually leads to the inhibition of suppressor cell function. Both of these cells are present in the spleen (SPL) and play a role in the regulation of antibody responses. The purpose of these studies was to identify the anti-suppressor T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and compare their function to their splenic counterparts. Inducer cells were detected in the Peyer's patches (PP), mesenteric lymph nodes but not in the intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The effector cells, which take up the complexes, were detected in PP and lamina propria lymphocytes but not in the intraepithelial or mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes. Furthermore, the uptake of the complexes correlated with the presence of T cells bearing Ia antigens. The PP and SPL anti-suppressor cells were compared for their ability to enhance the production of IgA and IgG. The data clearly showed that the product of the <b>inducer</b> <b>cell,</b> and the effector cell it activates, not only enhanced the antigen-specific responses but also selected for isotype-specific antibody responses.

Libraries were generated from B-cell receptor repertoires of classII-mismatched mice immunized with RegII-pulsed NOD antigen presenting cells or from T-cell receptor repertoires in pancreatic lymph nodes of NOD mice. Both approaches yielded clones recognizing a RegII-derived epitope {{in the context of}} I-A(g 7), which activated autoreactive CD 4 (+) T-cells. A receptor with different specificity was obtained by converting the BDC 2. 5 TCR into single chain form. B- but not T-cells from donors vaccinated with the clones transferred protection from diabetes to NOD-SCID recipients if the specificity of the diabetes <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> and the single chain receptor were matched. B-cells and antibodies from donors vaccinated with the BDC 2. 5 single chain receptor induced a state of profound anergy in T-cells of BDC 2. 5 TCR transgenic NOD recipients while B-cells from donors vaccinated with a single chain receptor specific for I-A(g 7) RegII peptide complexes induced only partial non-responsiveness. Vaccination of normal NOD mice with receptors recognizing I-A(g 7) RegII peptide complexes or with the BDC 2. 5 single chain receptor delayed onset of T 1 D.

Here, we have analysed the cellular and molecular requirements for the initial appearance of Aire+ mTEC in the embryonic thymus, in addition to their persistence in the adult thymus.

We have found that isoantisera directed to a number of BALB/c methylcholanthrene-induced tumors block the induction of T suppressor cells but they do so only if the inducer or acceptor T cell (or both) expresses BALB/c Igh-linked polymorphisms. All other BALB/c gene products are irrelevant. These findings suggest that “transformation related antigens” on some sarcoma cells are variants of, or are otherwise related to, the cell interaction molecules that T cell subsets use to communicate with one another under normal circumstances. Furthermore, the findings that (a) multiple methylcholanthrene-induced tumors express serologically related antigens (as well as the unique ones that have been previously demonstrated by transplantation tests) and (b) these serologically related antigens can be found on Igh-V-controlled T cell communication molecules raise the intriguing possibility that, like certain viruses, methylcholanthrene reacts with specific regions of cellular DNA that either directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other specific genes (in this particular case the genes that encode the T cell communication molecules) ...|$|E
40|$|Idiosyncratic drug {{reactions}} (IDRs) are adverse drug {{reactions that}} are rare, sporadic, unpredicted by clinical trials, unrelated to drugs’ pharmacology and occur without relation to time or dose. IDRs {{may arise from}} drug interaction with inflammation that render the liver more sensitive to injury resulting in increased toxicity. With the aim to develop a translational model to unravel the mechanism behind IDRs and to find biomarkers that can detect them, we used mouse (M) and human (H) precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) to study the influence of inflammatory reactions on the toxicity of drugs. PCLS technology is receiving increased attention as a potential ex vivo toxicological model because PCLS retain the normal tissue architecture of an intact liver with all its cell types in their natural environment. PCLS from M and H were incubated with paracetamol (APAP), diclofenac (DF), ketoconazole (KT) or clozapine (CZ) alone and {{in the presence of}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammation <b>inducer.</b> <b>Cell</b> viability [ATP] and cytokine production [CBA] were assessed. APAP, DF, and CZ (but not KT) were more toxic in M than H. LPS had no influence on APAP and DF toxicity in M or H. APAP and DF slightly increased LPS-induced TNF-α production in M but strongly reduced it in H PCLS and both decreased the LPS-induced IL- 1 β production in both species. In contrast, toxicity of KT (only in M) and CZ (in both M and H) was aggravated {{in the presence of a}} non-toxic dose of LPS and an increase in LPS-induced IL- 1 β production was observed here. In conclusion, clear species differences were identified in the effect of the drugs on toxicity and on inflammatory reactions due to LPS. Toxicity of KT (only in M) and CZ (in both M and H) was aggravated by LPS, not observed in the cases of APAP or DF. A correlation appeared between increased toxicity and increased LPS-induced IL- 1 β production in the co-incubation of LPS and drug. Based on these results, PCLS appear to be a promising ex vivo model to study mechanisms behind IDRs...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{changes in}} psychological and immunological functioning during 5 -week periods preceding and following notification of serostatus among gay males taking the HIV- 1 antibody test. Forty-six asymptomatic homosexual men {{between the ages}} of 18 and 40 yrs were recruited from a gay men 2 ̆ 7 s organization and through advertisements in a local newspaper. Measures of cell-mediated immunity (lymphocyte phenotypic markers, mitogen responsivity, and natural killer cell cytotoxicity) and psychological functioning (state anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and avoidant behaviors) were obtained at baseline, five weeks later and 72 hr before serostatus notification, and 1 week, 3 weeks and 5 weeks postnotification. Results suggested a dissociation between psychological and immunological phenomena among seropositives wherein lymphocyte proliferative responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) remained unchanged in the face of significant increases in state anxiety and intrusive thoughts following serostatus notification. These findings suggested that asymptomatic HIV- 1 infected individuals, even at the earliest stages of infection, may be unable to mount an immune response to potent psychosocial stressors (i. e., serostatus notification), due perhaps, {{to the fact that the}} viral contribution to immune functioning overrides any influence of environmental stimuli. Among the seronegative subjects studied, blastogenic responses to PHA and PWM were depressed at baseline (relative to a group of age and gender-matched controls who were not undergoing HIV- 1 antibody testing) but PHA values returned to normal values 5 weeks later. Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and CD 4 +CD 45 R+ <b>inducer</b> <b>cell</b> counts appeared to parallel these changes in seronegatives. Seropositives did display fluctuations in NK cell cytotoxicity that were similar to those noted for seronegatives. Correlational analyses suggested that individual differences in anxiety responses at the time of notification of seropositivity predicted subsequent (1 -week lag) declines in NK cell cytotoxicity but not other functional markers. Although most seropositives displayed clinical levels of anxiety, intrusive thoughts and avoidant responses during the week of serostatus notification, these measures returned to their initial nonclinical baseline levels within 5 weeks after notification in both the seropositive and seronegative groups...|$|E
40|$|Skin biopsies from leukaemic {{patients}} undergoing allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantations and treated prophylactically with cyclosporin A were analysed using histological, morphometric, and immunohistological techniques. Samples from donors {{were used to}} establish normal values. Biopsies taken from recipients two days before grafting were all histologically normal, but on immunohistological staining half of them showed {{a reduction in the}} number of epidermal Langerhans' cells and 29 % a reduction in T inducer lymphocytes. Thirty two biopsies were taken from patients with rashes at various times after transplantation: 14 showed lichenoid changes consistent with graft versus host disease, three eczematous tissue reactions, two vesicular lesions, and 12 no histological abnormality. One sample showed changes intermediate between the lichenoid and eczematous forms. The numbers of epidermal Langerhans' cells were low during the first few weeks after transplantation and were normal or raised later regardless of histological appearances. Unlike epidermal Langerhans' cells, significant reductions in the numbers of lymphocytes were not seen. Lesions of all histological types contained mixtures of T inducer and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells, although the eczematous and vesicular lesions contained higher proportions of T <b>inducer</b> <b>cells.</b> Epidermal infiltrates invariably contained T suppressor/cytotoxic cells but infiltration of epidermis by T <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> occurred only in the presence of normal numbers of epidermal Langerhans' cells. Natural killer cells were not identified. The immunological appearances of the various histological subgroups thus change with time after transplantation...|$|R
40|$|LTa and LTb are {{expressed}} on activated lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and lymphoid tissue <b>inducer</b> <b>cells</b> involved in lymphoid organogenesis. All 3 members are indispensable {{for the formation}} of B-cell follicles, germinal centers, and follicular dendritic cells. LTa can either be secreted as a homotrimer or it can be retained on the cell surface in heterotrimeric complexes with LTb (LTa 1 LTb 2). LTa shares its receptors with TNF, the TNFR 1 and TNFR 2 receptors, whereas LTa 1 LTb 2 signals through a distinct receptor, the LTbR.
