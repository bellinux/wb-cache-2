40|$|A vortex motion phase {{separator}} is disclosed for transferring {{a liquid}} in a zero gravity environment {{while at the}} same time separating the liquid from vapors found within either <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> or <b>the</b> receiving tanks. The separator comprises a rigid sender tank having a circular cross-section and rigid receiver tank having a circular cross-section. A plurality of ducts connects <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank and <b>the</b> receiver tank. Disposed within the ducts connecting the receiver tank and <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank is a pump and a plurality of valves. The pump is powered by an electric motor and is adapted to draw either the liquid or a mixture of the liquid and the vapor from <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank. Initially, <b>the</b> mixture drawn from <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank is directed through a portion of the ductwork and back into <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank at a tangent to the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank, thereby creating a swirling vortex of the mixture within <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank. As <b>the</b> pumping action increases, the speed of the swirling action within <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank increases creating an increase in the centrifugal force operating on the mixture. The effect of the centrifugal force is to cause the heavier liquid to migrate to the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank and to separate from the vapor. When this separation reaches a predetermined degree, control means is activated to direct the liquid conveyed by the pump directly into the receiver tank. At the same time, the vapor within the receiver tank is directed from the receiver tank back into <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank. This flow continues until substantially all of the liquid is transferred from <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> tank to <b>the</b> receiver tank...|$|R

50|$|Yao {{explained}} how to garble a circuit (hide its structure) so that two parties, sender and receiver, can learn {{the output of}} the circuit and nothing else. At a high level, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> prepares <b>the</b> garbled circuit and sends it to the receiver, who obliviously evaluates the circuit, learning the encodings corresponding to both his and <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> output. He then just sends back <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> encodings, allowing <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> to compute his part of <b>the</b> output. <b>The</b> <b>sender</b> sends <b>the</b> mapping from the receivers output encodings to bits to the receiver, allowing the receiver to obtain their output.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sender's</b> {{strategy}} is: {{a friend}} {{does not give}} and an enemy gives. The receiver's beliefs are updated accordingly: if she receives a gift she knows that <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> is a enemy, otherwise she knows that <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> is a friend. The receiver's strategy is: reject. Again, this is NOT an equilibrium, since <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> strategy is not optimal: an enemy sender can increase his payoff from -1 to 0 by not sending a gift.|$|R

30|$|Position-based routing {{protocols}} always route the data packet to the neighboring node {{closest to the}} destination node. <b>The</b> <b>sender</b> node searches its list of neighbors for this node, but the selected next hop node may not be within the transmission range of <b>the</b> <b>sender,</b> although it is listed as a neighboring node. This is because the routing neighbor {{is close to the}} limit of <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> transmission range with a high probability that the selected neighboring node may have left <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> transmission range, even though it is still listed in <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> list of neighbors.

50|$|Closed loop {{communication}} is a communication technique used to avoid misunderstandings.

When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> will say “negative” (or something similar) and then repeat the correct message. If <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> (person giving <b>the</b> message) does not get a reply back, she must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop.
