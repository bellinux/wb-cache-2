500|$|In December 1895, the Boston Daily Globe {{published}} a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston's [...] "quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman." [...] The Globe {{noted that the}} ease with which Lowe played the game led many to understate his value to the club:"For a grand player, Lowe is seldom given the credit often dished out to his inferiors. His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering around like a <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw. 'He is a hard worker,' you will hear them say. Bobby Lowe is not only a hard worker but a conscientious player and an artist of the first magnitude." ...|$|E

500|$|While the {{majority}} of the critics gave [...] "Lord Snow" [...] a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 80% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development." [...] Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was [...] "perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six," [...] although he highlighted that it was [...] "hardly a bad episode of television, filled as it is with satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series," [...] and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories are being told with such passion." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that [...] "Lord Snow" [...] was [...] "dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, {{which may or may not}} have interested those new to this story - but I found myself hanging on every precious word." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying [...] "Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, simple thing that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on" [...] and continued [...] "I liked the looser, more rambling quality of [...] "Lord Snow," [...] an episode largely about transitions, <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and old ghosts.|$|E

"Parallels" [...] {{was part}} of a {{collection}} of songs that Squire had written for his solo album <b>Fish</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Water</b> (1975), but were left out due to the limited capacity of a vinyl record. He also felt the song did not fit with the style of the other tracks on his album. When it came to selecting songs for Going for the One, Squire suggested the song for the group to record, which was received well by the other members. In its rough form, the song contained no guitar riffs. Its lyrics address the idea of hope, a usual theme that Squire incorporates into his lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics upon its release.

He explained that whilst many expected the worst from another Girls Aloud band member, he noted [...] "You expect the worst – well, not worse than Cole's terrible albums, but not good – {{only to discover}} that Cinderella’ s Eyes is actually very promising". Robert Copsey from Digital Spy found that without listening to the album the impact would be limited as she had a [...] "troubled start" [...] and [...] "limited solo spots" [...] with band Girls Aloud but after listening to the record he expressed that her transition to a [...] "trendy solo songstress is one discussed with admirable honesty throughout her debut offering". James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars out of five and stated [...] "Nicola Roberts has made an assured solo debut that suggests she may outlast her flashier bandmates as a pop star of substance", he positively commented on her use of a [...] "autobiographical lyrics" [...] and compared the album to that of artist Robyn. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling [...] "Beat of My Drum", [...] "infectiously bratty" [...] and positively responded to the track [...] "Porcelain Heart" [...] saying, [...] "her Florence-bothering bellow of [...] "heaaaaaart" [...] on the fearsome [...] "Porcelain Heart", Roberts sounds utterly self-assured." [...] Rick Pearson of the Evening Standard felt that her Cinderella-persona for the album concept was appropriate to her life story calling the record [...] "a glittering pop song furnished with yelping Kate Bush-isms – while Metronomy's Joseph Mount drops by to produce the haunting highlight <b>Fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Water.</b> Fun and fearless: Roberts can go to the ball".|$|E

2500|$|The idyllic life of Duncan and Tessa is {{shattered}} {{by the arrival of}} a message from one of Mac's teachers, the priest Darius, in [...] "Band Of Brothers" [...] Darius' most powerful enemy, Grayson, was coming to Seacouver, to eliminate a mortal peacemaker and disciple of Darius, Viktor Paulus. Grayson was a lieutenant of Darius when they led an army across Europe in the 5th century but turned against him when Darius killed the then-oldest living Immortal at the gates of Paris and became a man of peace. [...] Determined to protect Tessa and Richie but uncertain of his ability to handle Grayson, he sends them to Darius for protection, then sets out to face Grayson. Grayson, a fellow Scot, offers MacLeod a position at his right hand, but Duncan refuses. Grayson takes MacLeod to the limit before the younger Highlander prevails. MacLeod follows his friends to Paris, where he and Tessa decide to stay, living on Duncan's barge; Tessa takes up a post as a curator, Duncan takes up the role of a kept man and Richie that of a <b>fish</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> in his role as a kept man, Duncan does the shopping, but as he is returning to the barge one morning, he sees a clown dressed as a mime kill an elderly man ("For Evil's Sake"). Helping the police, he tells them that he can identify the man. The police inspector, LeBrun, is convinced he has seen Duncan before. Later, mysterious men with guns stake out the barge and, when Duncan fells one, he finds that he is a policeman. LeBrun has remembered Duncan - {{when he was a young}} gendarme, they were chasing the assassin Kuyler and he saw Duncan then. LeBrun's assistant is in Kuyler's pay, but Duncan silences the mime forever and LeBrun arrests his assistant. Duncan hasn't finished with LeBrun, for when his old enemy Xavier St Cloud crosses his path again, Duncan throws one of Xavier's gas grenades into a cement mixer and LeBrun fishes it out ("For Tomorrow We Die"). Convinced MacLeod is the gas poisoner, LeBrun tries to run him in whilst Duncan has to stop Xavier from gassing an exhibition Tessa is organising. Frustrated, Xavier comes for Duncan, but Duncan cuts off Xavier's hand and he disappears into the Seine. The series also introduced two old Immortal lovers of Duncan’s to test Tessa's restraint. Grace Chandel, on the run both from the police, who want to arrest her for killing her husband, and the Immortal ex-lover who was the real killer, the possessive Carlo Sendaro ("Saving Grace") was welcomed by Tessa, when Duncan and Darius help her escape, Duncan making sure that Carlo will not trouble her again. The same was not true of Amanda, described by Duncan as [...] "a bad habit". In [...] "The Lady & The Tiger" [...] we met the unprincipled cat-burglar with a passion for circuses, robbery, and 400-year-old Scotsmen, here trying to set up MacLeod so that the Immortal thief she had double crossed, Zachary Blaine, would not take her head. In the end, she takes Zachary's, but not before Duncan has done all the hard work. Which pretty much set the pattern for all of the Amanda stories to come.|$|E
