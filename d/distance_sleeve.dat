50|$|A men's Olympic barbell weighs 20 kg (44 lbs) with a shaft {{diameter}} of 28 mm and {{a length of}} 2200 mm, whereas a women's Olympic barbell weighs 15 kg (33 lbs) and has a {{shaft diameter}} of 25 mm with a length of 2010 mm. The <b>distance</b> between the <b>sleeves,</b> however, {{is the same for}} the men's and the women's bars at 1310 mm. The grip texture of the bar is called the knurling, and is distributed differently between the men's and women's bars: the men's has knurling in the centre but the women's does not. The Olympic barbells used in competition are certified by the IWF.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the article}} the flow {{field in the}} twin-tangential annular flow gas {{distributor}} was simulated based on the standard k-ε turbulent model with FLUENT software according to various <b>distance</b> L between <b>sleeve</b> and column wall and differing numbers of baffles, after comprehensively analyzing, got the best technological parameters with misdistribution factor and pressure drop. Based on {{the analysis of the}} flow field discipline of the twin-tangential annular flow gas distributor and the two-line vane gas distributor, and the systematic comparison of the performance of these two kinds of gas distributors in the flue gas CO 2 absorption column, the research will provide the important theoretical foundation for the choosing and designing of the distributor of the flue gas CO 2 absorber...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{also shows}} the stress arch is most obvious {{within a certain}} range from the sleeve end. Within the range, the soil plug {{undertakes}} the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance, and the stress value increases with the penetration depth. The simulation results accord with the study of Lobo-Guerrero and Vallejo (2007), the contact stress mainly was concentrated at the bottom of sleeve end, and was delivered to the interior of the sleeve in a short <b>distance</b> from the <b>sleeve</b> end. During sleeve jacking, the void ratio is slightly smaller than the void ratio in initial stress state due to the monotonic shear between the soils and sleeve wall. Compared to the sleeve jacking, the arching effect of vibratory sleeve driving is relatively weaker, since the cyclic shear between the soils and sleeve wall makes void ratio decrease to the minimum value (Henke and Grabe 2008). The soil plug is compacted under vibratory action, which makes the soils at the bottom of sleeve difficult to be squeezed into the sleeve. Consequently, the arching effect is relatively weaker.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, guided implant surgery {{has been}} {{introduced}} and several studies verified its accuracy. While those studies reported on {{the accuracy of the}} entire procedure, this experiment wanted to evaluate the degree of deviation that can occur during the drilling procedure alone, due to the tolerance of the drill in the sleeve insert. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Drilling was executed in a plexi-glass box with a maximal inclination of the drills within the sleeve insert. Different sleeve inserts, sleeve positions, sleeve heights, sleeve insert heights and diameters were evaluated. RESULTS: The two tested sleeve inserts gave a maximum deviation in angulation of 5. 2 ° and a maximum horizontal deviation of 1. 3  mm at the implant shoulder and 2. 4  mm at the apex for a 13  mm implant. These deviations decreased if the <b>distance</b> of the <b>sleeve</b> above the plexi-glass box became smaller and hand hold sleeve inserts gave less deviation than drill hold sleeve inserts. The deviation increased by longer implant length, larger drill key diameter, shorter sleeves and/or drill key heights. CONCLUSIONS: For a minimal deviation during the surgery with a stereolithographic guide, {{it is very important to}} use the drill in a centric position, parallel to the cylinder. The use of longer drill keys and sleeves are critical for optimal accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R
