5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. <b>In</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 2007, Kariya {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth $18 million with the St. Louis Blues. <b>In</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to his signing with Nashville, his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team's first notable free agent acquisitions in a while (arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991). While the Predators were a team on the rise when he joined them, the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E

5|$|Bangladesh's second innings started <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> {{to their}} first; {{they lost the}} early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E
5|$|Both sides made changes {{going into}} the second ODI; for England, Sidebottom made way as England opted to hand a debut to Tredwell in order to play two spinners, while Bangladesh called on Shuvo and Rubel Hossain, {{dropping}} Siddique and Mortaza. For the second consecutive match, England won the toss and chose to field. The match began <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to the first ODI, with two quick wickets in the 10th and 11th overs taking Bangladesh from 46/0 to 56/2. However, a third-wicket partnership of 90 between Kayes and Rahim steadied the innings and helped Bangladesh to gain confidence. After Imrul Kayes' dismissal, Rahim increased his scoring-rate {{with a series of}} boundaries to take the score past 200, and was dismissed by a slower ball from Bresnan with the score at 211/5. Some late swinging from the tail saw Bangladesh finish on 260/6, their highest total in ODIs against England.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the cast}} in Vampyr were not {{professional}} actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris.

Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|Already {{frequently}} {{compared to}} compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous {{goals in the}} span of three weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran , and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> many leading {{directors}} {{made one}} or more films at RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with Notorious, and Jean Renoir, with This Land Is Mine (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and The Woman on the Beach (1947). John Ford's The Fugitive (1947) and Fort Apache (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950); all four were co-productions between RKO and Argosy Pictures, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler's Children (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, {{it was one of}} the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, Behind the Rising Sun, released a few months later, was similarly profitable.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, on 18 July 2008, Evra was charged with four {{separate}} counts of improper conduct by the FA. The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007–08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm-down following a match on 26 April. The defender denied the charges and was supported by several members of the club's staff, who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation. Evra remained free to play for United up to the date of the hearing despite the charges being made in July 2008. He began the campaign <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team's 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties. Evra was ever-present in Manchester United's first 22 competitive matches of the season, starting 19 of them. At the hearing on 5 December, Evra was found guilty of improper conduct, and handed a four-match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £15,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. <b>In</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

5|$|The match began <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion</b> to {{the earlier}} contest; the Non-Smokers won the toss, and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first. The Smokers, led by the Australian Harry Boyle, walked onto the pitch smoking cigars. Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers, which {{included}} Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann, the Non-Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell, that of William Bruce for 131. Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four, bringing in Billy Gunn. Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together {{for the rest of}} the day, and the following morning, building a partnership of 310 runs; Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236, while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150. Fifties from Richard Houston, Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle-order boosted the score to 803, a new record for the highest innings total in first-class cricket. The previous record, 775 runs, had also been set in Australia, by New South Wales. The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket, which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against Rickling Green in 1882. The score has since been surpassed over twenty times.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 season {{continued}} <b>in</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fashion,</b> with Djokovic, Federer and Murray occupying {{three of}} the four semifinal slots at the Australian Open, with Nadal still suffering from injury. Murray beat Federer in a five-set epic in the semifinal meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once in a Grand Slam event, subsequently losing to Djokovic in the final in four sets. As a result, Djokovic became the third man to win four Australian Open titles and the first to win three consecutively in the Modern Era; and Murray himself became the first man to reach the final of the next Grand Slam event after winning his maiden title. Nadal returned for the clay-court season, winning events in Sao Paulo, Mexico, Barcelona, Madrid and Rome before becoming the only male player to win a Grand Slam tournament eight times by winning Roland Garros, defeating Djokovic in the semifinals. However, Djokovic did end Nadal's eight-year winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Murray's clay-court season ended prematurely because of a back injury and did not compete at the French Open, whereas Federer lost in the quarterfinals after making the final in Rome. Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon in the first and second round respectively, thus ending Federer's 36 consecutive Grand Slam tournament quarter final appearance record. Murray defeated Djokovic in the final to become the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years, extending his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. Leading up to the U.S. Open, Nadal won ATP Masters 1000 events in Montreal and Cincinnati, his third hardcourt ATP Masters 1000 event of the year after winning at Indian Wells earlier in the year, extending his winning streak to 15–0 in hardcourts for the year. He went onto win the U.S. Open, defeating Djokovic in the final in four sets. While Murray and Federer lost in the quarterfinals and fourth round respectively.|$|E
