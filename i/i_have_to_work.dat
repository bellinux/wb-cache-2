25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|By 1967, Lennon's {{aggressive}} edges {{from his}} childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours at end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another). [...] Cynthia once complained, saying: [...] "What I'd like is a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me". Lennon replied with, [...] "OK, I know, we'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?" [...] Then adding, [...] "No, I've got these bloody songs to write. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> to justify living."

500|$|Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had {{previously}} written {{two of the}} three past Halo novels, [...] and , and went to Halos developer Bungie with an outline of {{what he wanted to do}} next. According to Nylund, Bungie gave him room to write the story as long as he accomplished some [...] "very specific [...] goals", sometimes making changes to the Halo universe to incorporate his ideas. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's not so good because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and play well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with before I go onto another career {{or do something}} else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had {{always been interested in}} doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E

She wanted to work with him since she heard [...] "Let Me Love You" [...] (2004) by Mario, which Ne-Yo wrote. When the production for A Girl like Me started, she considered working with him. She said, [...] "So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with that guy Ne-Yo.' So we went into the studio and we started working on this song." [...] Ne-Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote [...] "Unfaithful", which Rihanna said was [...] "new ground for [...] " [...] because it was a ballad.
