40|$|Peephole optimizers improve {{object code}} by {{replacing}} certain sequences <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> with better sequences. This paper describes PO, a peephole optimizer {{that uses a}} symbolic machine description to simulate pairs <b>of</b> adjacent <b>instructions,</b> replacing them, where possible, with an equivalent sing!e instruction. As {{a result of this}} organization, PO is machine independent and can be described formally and concisely: when PO is finished, no instruction, and no pair <b>of</b> adjacent <b>instructions,</b> can be replaced with a cheaper single instruction that has the same effect. This thoroughness allows PO to relieve code <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> much case analysis; for example, they might produce only load/add-register sequences and rely on PO to, where possible, discard them in favor of add-memory, add-immediate, or increment instructions. Experiments indicate that naive code generators can give good code if used with PO...|$|R

Questionnaires modified from previous studies were used as an instrument. The data were analyzed using SPSS and the results of the analysis were reported in the form of descriptive statistics. The reliability of the instrument using Cronbach Alpha was 0. 644 for part B and 0. 797 for part C. The results showed that teachers had a positive opinion for the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> and practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> was at a high level, the study showed no difference of opinion about the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on gender and race, and found a difference of opinion about the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on experience teaching.

40|$|In {{my opinion}} the paper {{goes into the}} right {{direction}} of disjoin-ing {{the notion of the}} Hamiltonian and the notion <b>of</b> the <b>generator</b> <b>of</b> the time evolution. It is a common believe that these two notions are identical. As a matter of fact, it is certainly true in the classical Hamilton- Jacobi formalism but has never been proved in quantum mechanics. It was simply transmitted to quantum mechanics by the correspondence principle. The example of the notion of angular mo-mentum and the notion <b>of</b> the <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> rotations explicitly shows that {{there is a difference between}} classical and quantum <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. In quantum physics apart from the orbital momen-tum the spin arises. This shows that the relation between classical <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> symmetry and classical physical observables is different from the relation <b>of</b> quantum mechanical <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> symmetry and quantum observables. It is not excluded that the quantum mechan-ical <b>generator</b> <b>of</b> time translation is not identical with the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. This statement is strengthened by the fact that already in classical physics we may have many non equivalent Hamiltonians[1] and it is not clear which one to use as a generato...|$|R
