5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger <b>impact</b> <b>features,</b> with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Moon's craters as <b>impact</b> <b>features</b> became widely {{accepted}} only in the 1940s. This realization allowed the impact history of the Moon to be gradually worked out {{by means of the}} geologic principle of superposition. That is, if a crater (or its ejecta) overlaid another, it must be the younger. The amount of erosion experienced by a crater was another clue to its age, though this is more subjective. Adopting this approach in the late 1950s, Gene Shoemaker took the systematic study of the Moon away from the astronomers and placed it firmly {{in the hands of the}} lunar geologists.|$|E
25|$|The data {{available}} on the crater indicate that Rembrandt {{is one of the}} youngest <b>impact</b> <b>features</b> on Mercury. Its age is roughly {{the same as that of}} Caloris. The basin probably formed near the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System about 3.9 billion year ago. The impact had excavated material from the lower part of the crust leading to the formation of the dark and relatively blue impact ejecta, which surrounds Rembrandt. The thinning of the crust, which resulted from the impact, stimulated effusive volcanic activity. Light-colored lavas filled the inner part of Rembrandt causing it to subside, which led to the contraction of the basin's floor and formation of wrinkle ridges. The later floor uplift, which causes are not known, led to the extension and formation of troughs.|$|E

The paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the tektites reported at Haiti.|$|R

500|$|The largest <b>impact</b> <b>features</b> on Callisto's surface are multi-ring basins. Two are enormous. Valhalla is the largest, with {{a bright}} central region 600kilometers in diameter, and rings {{extending}} as far as 1,800kilometers from the center (see figure). The second largest is Asgard, measuring about 1,600kilometers in diameter. Multi-ring structures probably originated {{as a result of}} a post-impact concentric fracturing of the lithosphere lying on a layer of soft or liquid material, possibly an ocean. The catenaefor example Gomul Catenaare long chains of impact craters lined up in straight lines across the surface. They were probably created by objects that were tidally disrupted as they passed close to Jupiter prior to the impact on Callisto, or by very [...] impacts. [...] A historical example of a disruption was Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.|$|E
500|$|Cratering is seen on {{both types}} of terrain, but is {{especially}} extensive on the dark terrain: {{it appears to be}} saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events. The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer <b>impact</b> <b>features,</b> which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution. The density of cratering indicates an age of 4billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain). Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4billion years ago {{similar to that of the}} Moon. If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since. Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible. Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a [...] "ghost" [...] of a crater known as a palimpsest.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>features</b> like Neith {{have been}} called [...] "penepalimpsests" [...] by some {{investigators}} or [...] "dome craters" [...] by others and {{are considered to be}} transitional between craters and palimpsests. Palimpsests are bright, nearly circular patches that are believed to be remnant <b>impact</b> <b>features.</b> They occur also on Callisto, Ganymede's neighbor farther distant from Jupiter.|$|E

At a relative impact velocity of about 7 km/s a considerable portion of the micrometeoroid was lost due to back splattering.

50|$|The {{origin of}} Desert glass is uncertain.

Some geologists associate the glass with radiative melting from meteoric large aerial bursts, making it analogous to trinitite created from sand exposed to the thermal radiation of a nuclear explosion. Libyan Desert glass has been dated as having formed about 26 million years ago. It was knapped and used to make tools during the Pleistocene.|$|E
50|$|The {{cometary impact}} {{hypothesis}} {{of the origin}} of the bays was popular among earth scientists of the 1940s and 50s. After considerable debate and research, geologists determined the depressions were both too shallow and lacking in any evidence for them to be <b>impact</b> <b>features.</b> Reports of magnetic anomalies turned out not to show consistency across the sites. There were no meteorite fragments, shatter cones or planar deformation features. None of the necessary evidence for hypervelocity impacts was found.
