In this work we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the kinetic and structural aspects of <b>gel</b> domain <b>formation</b> in small lipid vesicles, specifically dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles with a diameter range of 20 – 40 nm. We observe that cooling of such vesicles below the phase transition temperature does not result in <b>gel</b> phase <b>formation</b> on a microsecond time scale, which we attribute to the presence of an effective area constraint. This area constraint is due to the strongly reduced membrane permeability at lower temperatures, preventing the rapid efflux of water and the required decrease in membrane area to form a gel phase.

The effect of lipid asymmetry was also studied with the lamellar setup, and found to be of less importance.
