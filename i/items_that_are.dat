After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball would {{be placed in the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be returned to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E
5|$|Each {{district}} has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E

5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken.

5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> infrequently purchased, {{as a single}} can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E

From this point there are the first finds of iron {{artifacts}} in hoards that are consistent containing other <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with Bronze Age practice. {{there is also evidence}} of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included roundhouses and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{develops}} as {{the player}} progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate side-quests. Dungeons {{appear as a}} variety of areas, including caves, sewers, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not available in most stores. Some dungeons feature puzzles and mazes, which require the player to divide the characters into multiple parties.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot {{develops}} as {{the player}} progresses through towns and dungeons. Some town citizens offer helpful information, while others own shops that sell items or equipment. Dungeons appear {{in areas that}} include forests, caves, mountains, swamps, underwater caverns, and buildings. Dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not available in most stores. The game's menu screen allows the player {{to keep track of}} their experience points and levels, to choose which equipment their characters wield, and to use items and magic. A character's most basic attribute is their level, which can range from one to fifty, and is determined by the character's amount of experience. Gaining a level increases the character's attributes, such as their maximum hit points (HP), which represents a character's remaining health; a character dies when they reach zero HP. Characters gain experience points by winning battles.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{earliest}} collections {{began to}} coalesce in 1836 {{through the work}} of Lewis C. Beck (1798–1853), a physician, botanist, entomologist, chemist and geologist, who taught at Rutgers {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} from 1830 until his death in 1853. Many of the exhibits feature <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unique to New Jersey, including Native American artifacts, minerals, and fossils. These exhibits include a set of fossilized dinosaur tracks believed to belong to the carnivorous Grallator, from the Jurassic-period discovered near Towaco in Morris County, and the skeleton of a 10,000-year old mastodon (Mammut americanum) discovered in Salem County in 1869. The mastodon, found in a marl pit near Mannington, was sold by a local farmer to a travelling circus before it was acquired by Rutgers for display.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E

40|$|A test is speeded {{when some}} {{respondents}} {{do not have}} sufficient time to attempt every item in the test within the allocated time (Bejar, 1985). If a number of items {{at the end of}} a test are not answered this <b>is</b> an indication <b>that</b> the test <b>was</b> speeded but it could also <b>be</b> the case <b>that</b> the <b>items</b> at the end of the test were too difficult for the respondent. A main issue in test speededness is the therefore the distinction between omitted <b>items</b> and <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not reached (Lord, 1980). The omitted items can be scored as incorrect while the <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not reached should <b>be</b> considered <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not administered. If all the <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not answered are scored as incorrect, the item parameters of the <b>items</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not reached become biased (Oshima, 1994). In this paper a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedures <b>is</b> proposed <b>that</b> takes into account test speededness. This procedure is a generalization of the MCMC procedures to estimate the two-parameter normal ogive model (Albert (1992). In the current estimation procedure test speededness is modeled with an additional parameter that indicates the last <b>item</b> <b>that</b> each respondent tried to answer.
