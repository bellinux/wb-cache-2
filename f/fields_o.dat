40|$|Recall that a {{vector field}} X on a smooth {{manifold}} M is complete if it generates a global flow ξ: M × R → M. If Xǫ is a smoothly parametrized family of vector <b>fields</b> (<b>ǫ</b> ∈ R), it may happen that X 0 is complete but all Xǫ with ǫ = 0 are incomplete. This {{is the case}} for instance with the family of vector <b>fields</b> <b>ǫ</b> · x 2 · ∂ ∂x on R. We shall prove, however, that in the context of synthetic differential geometry, if X 0 is complete, then so is Xǫ for any ǫ with ǫ 2 = 0. We presuppose some general notions from synthetic differential geometry (SDG), cf. [3], but also some more particular results [5].
