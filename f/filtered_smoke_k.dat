Tobacco smoke caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of all the mammalian cells exposed compared with controls. NSM smoke {{did not have a}} significant effect on the DNA content of the exposed cells (P less than 0. 95). Smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixtures. Condensate from cigarettes containing tobacco or blends of tobacco and NSM caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in DNA content of mammalian cell populations in culture, whereas equal weights of condensate from NSM alone or NSM containing nicotine did not cause significant changes (P less than 0. 05).

The toxicity of used cigarette filters depends on the specific tobacco blend and additives used by the cigarette companies. After a cigarette is <b>smoked,</b> the <b>filter</b> retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of cigarette filters, the various chemicals that can be found in cigarette filters are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole cigarette filter and its LD50. LD50 is defined as the lethal dose that kills 50% of a sample population.

The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a new approach for prediction of the marine diesel engine emissions based on ANNs. The marine engine exhaust emissions were measured for different engine loads conditions according to the IMO technical code. According to the results, the network performance is sufficient for all emission outputs. In the network, engine speed (N), engine load (L), fuel flow rate (FFR), air mass flow rate (AMR), scavenge air pressure(SAR), maximum injection pressure (MIP), electronic parameters and environmental conditions were taken as the input parameters, and the values of emissions were used as the output parameters. The R 2 values of the modeling were 0. 98, and the mean % errors were smaller. However, <b>filter</b> <b>smoke</b> number (FSN) higher mean errors were obtained due to the complexity of the burning process and the measurement errors.

Similar trends were seen for microbial proliferation and accumulation of apparent ammonia and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) during the storage temperatures evaluated. Notable exception in quality profile was found in lipid oxidation which was, as expected, lower for treated samples at all storage temperatures for TBARS (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and lower or significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) lower for POV values.

In addition to being an important member of clock circuitry, Nr 1 d 1, also regulates cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, and inflammation and is also touted as a tumor suppressor.

Nr 1 d 1 expression was downregulated by both WS and FS irrespective of mouse strain as compared to respective air-breathing controls. WS was more effective than FS on decreasing Nr 1 d 1 expression.

40|$|In a case control {{study of}} over 12 000 inpatients aged 35 - 74, risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and, {{particularly}} in those aged 35 - 54, ischaemic heart disease was positively associated {{with the number of}} manufactured cigarettes smoked daily and was negatively associated with long term giving up. Risk of stroke was not clearly related to smoking. Among manufactured cigarette smokers, lung cancer risk tended to be lowest in those who had always <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes. This pattern was, however, evident only in men who additionally smoked pipes, cigars or handrolled cigarettes and in women, not being seen in men who smoked only manufactured cigarettes. Risk of lung cancer was not clearly related to time of switch to filter cigarettes. A markedly lower risk of chronic bronchitis was seen in men, but not women, who <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> rather than plain cigarettes. Heart disease risk did not vary by type of cigarette smoked 10 years before admission, but, compared with those who had never <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes, those who had ever <b>smoked</b> <b>filter</b> cigarettes had a higher risk in men and a lower risk in younger women. Compared with the general population, markedly more controls were ex-smokers, suggesting incipient disease, whether or not smoking related, may alter smoking habits, thus affecting the interpretability of the findings. Control smokers were also relatively much more likely to report smoking plain cigarettes than expected. This comparison, not made in other studies relating risk to type of cigarette smoked, indicates that great care must be taken in verifying validity of reported smoking habits. While our findings are compatible with other evidence that risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis is probably reduced by switching from plain to filter cigarettes, they underline the difficulties in obtaining valid evidence from epidemiological studies...|$|R

Lomonosov attributed that effect to refraction of solar rays through an atmosphere; he also reported the appearance of a sliver around the part of Venus that had just entered the Sun's disk during the initial phase of transit. [...] In 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan reported, based on knowing what Venus's atmosphere would look like because of Pasachoff and Schneider's observations of the 2004 transit of Venus, that what Lomonosov reported was not Venus's atmosphere.
