25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E

We made straight across the parade for Dunlop's bungalow, with musket balls flying in all directions, as soon as the fellows we had gone through recovered from their first astonishment; but they are not <b>good</b> <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the best, and a man running at his top speed is not an easy mark by moonlight. We heard yells and musket shots all round, and knew that while a part of the regiment was attacking us, parties were told off to each bungalow. By the time we had got over the few hundred yards to Dunlop's, the whistling of the bullets round us had pretty well ceased, for the fellows had all emptied their muskets; besides, we were nearly out of range. None of them were near us, for they had stopped in their run to fire; they were too much interested in the massacre going on inside, and we seemed pretty safe; when, just as I entered the gate of the compound, a stray bullet hit me on the head, and down I went like a log.|$|R
5000|$|During the First (1994-1996) and Second Chechen Wars (1999-2009), Chechen rebels used RPGs {{to attack}} Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was {{effective}} because tank main guns {{could not be}} depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very {{top and bottom of}} tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on artillery suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4, Tunguska-M1) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent [...] "cells" [...] that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG (RPG-7V or RPG-18, for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians' ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed <b>good</b> <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the weakest armor (the top). When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{critics who}} enjoyed Morning Glory {{pointed out that}} the film was funny and entertaining. James Berardinelli of ReelViews wrote: [...] "Despite the {{conventional}} manner in which the story is resolved, Morning Glory generates enough entertainment, good will, and genuine laughs to make it hard to dislike ... It fits into a shrinking category: the old-fashioned, not-too-raunchy, character-based comedy. It's gentle, unforced and, despite its flaws, likeable. It doesn't blaze new trails or astound with its wit but, more likely than not, you'll leave the theater with a smile, and that's certainly worth a recommendation." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said: [...] "This unofficial update on the news-vs.-fluff wars does get in some <b>good</b> <b>shots</b> <b>at</b> the wacky world of morning television.... It includes more than a few clever lines, and boasts a stellar cast." [...] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon described the film as [...] "a brash, lightweight backstage comedy that looks lovely, doesn't insult its audience and uses its stars, both young and old, to terrific effect." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote: [...] "The movie's a pleasant and occasionally hilarious ride, even if there's a bait-and-switch at its core." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded Morning Glory three-and-a-half stars out of four. He stated: [...] "Morning Glory is funny entertainment to begin with, and then Rachel McAdams transforms it. And Harrison Ford transforms himself. (...) This is the kind I like best. It grows from human nature and is about how people do their jobs and live their lives." ...|$|R

With beating heart, but steady hand and frowning eye, he advanced another step and found--that the object was a yellow stone! ...|$|E
60|$|Whenever {{the game}} was within range they pulled up, and John would spring from the cart and let drive, then jump in and follow on again. This went on for nearly an hour, in which time he had fired twenty-seven {{cartridges}} and killed three blesbuck and wounded a vilderbeeste, which they proceeded to chase. But the vilderbeeste was struck in the rump, and an antelope so wounded will travel far, and go very fast also, so that some miles of ground had been covered before it began to rest, only to start on again as they drew near. At last, on crossing {{the crest of a}} little rise, John saw what at first he took to be his vilderbeeste, dead. A second look, however, showed him that, although it was a dead vilderbeeste, most undoubtedly it was not the one which he had wounded, for that animal was standing, its head hanging, about one hundred and twenty yards beyond the other buck, which, no doubt, had fallen to somebody else's rifle, or else had been hit farther back and come here to die. Now this vilderbeeste lay within a hundred yards of them, and Jantje pointed out to John that his best plan would be {{to get out of the}} cart and creep on his hands and knees up to the dead animal, from the cover of which he would get a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> his own wounded bull.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} too dark for any of them to get a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> him if he made a dash from their midst, and Davis decided to try for life and liberty. He knocked a large warrior before him into the fire, bounded over him, burst through the group around him, and before they could seize their rifles, which were all stacked together, he had {{vanished}} {{in the shadows of}} the forest. They followed him, whooping and yelling, but none could draw a bead on him, and not a shot was fired. One Indian was so near that Davis fancied he felt his grasp at times, but he fell behind, and Davis kept on. When he had distanced them all, he stopped to tear up his waistcoat, and wrap his feet, naked and bleeding from the sharp stones which had cut them in his wild flight, and then hurried on toward the Ohio. Three days without food or fire, in the cold of the early winter, passed before he reached the river, eight or ten miles below the mouth of the Scioto. He then saw a large boat coming down the stream, but his troubles did not end with this joyful sight. One of the dreadful facts of the dreadful time was the frequent deception of boatmen by Indians and renegades who pretended to be escaping prisoners, and who lured them to their destruction by piteous appeals for help. The boatmen now refused to land for Davis; they told him they had heard too many stories like his, and they kept on down the stream, while he followed wearily along the shore. At last he entreated them to row in a little nearer, so that he could swim out to them. They consented to this, and he plunged into the icy water, and was taken on board just as his strength was spent.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few years}} ago, in the UK a banner-towing {{aircraft}} crashed {{at the end}} of a flight; it carried a passenger, a politician for whose election campaign the banner towing flight was intended to draw attention. Unfortunately, it did that but for the wrong reasons. At the time, it was speculated in the press that the extra weight of the passenger would have been the cause of the accident. This is highly unlikely. The aircraft should have been able to carry the added weight. It is much more likely that the pilot was making a low pass to allow the press photographers to get a <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> Flying <b>at</b> low airspeed, the banner will be substantially below the flight path of the aircraft. It is probable that the pilot misjudged the height and room required to remain clear of the surface, the banner dragged over the ground and the rapidly increasing resistance as more parts of the banner would come into contact with the surface would in a very short time, a matter of mere seconds, caused the aircraft to stall. Releasing the banner, either by the pilot or by the [...] "weak link" [...] breaking would not have saved the aircraft: It would have been in a full stall and losing the stabilizing effect of the banner it is likely that it slammed into the ground. In a fully developed stall, the application of full power would also have been too late to take effect.|$|R
6000|$|Early in {{my school}} days a boy had {{a copy of the}} 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the {{veracity}} of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the [...] "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became a very <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> When <b>at</b> Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle. The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the tutor of the college remarked, [...] "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr. Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I often hear the crack when I pass under his windows." ...|$|R
25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods.

In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being <b>shot</b> <b>at,</b> and in 1892 A <b>Good</b> <b>Shot,</b> Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|R
