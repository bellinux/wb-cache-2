40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} cracking {{plays an}} important role in determining the final failureof unidirectional (UD) composites. When subjected to longitudinally tensile loading,fiber/matrix interface debonds originate from fiber breaks or initial defects propagatealong loading direction. Depending on the quality of fiber/matrix interface, debondscould keep growing longitudinally which leads to the degradation of compositestiffness or kink out of interface and connect with neighboring debonds or fiberbreaks that forms a so called critical fracture plane which leads to the final failure ofUD composite. For UD composite subjected to transversely tensile loading, theinitiation, growth and coalesce of arc-shape fiber/matrix interface debonds result inthe formation of macro-size transverse cracks, the propagation and multiplication ofthese transverse cracks, although would not directly lead to the final failure ofcomposite, could cause significant stiffness degradation of composite structures. In the presence thesis, the growth of a fiber/matrix interface <b>debond</b> of a UDcomposite with hexagonal fiber packing under longitudinal and transverse tensileloading was investigated numerically, with the special focus on the influence ofneighboring fibers. In the current study, energy release rate (ERR) is considered as thedriving force for the <b>debond</b> growth and was calculated based on J Integral andVirtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) using finite element software ANSSY. Papers A – C in the present thesis deal with the influence of neighboring fibers on theERR of a <b>debond</b> emanating from a fiber break under longitudinal loading condition. In longitudinal loading case, <b>debond</b> growth is mode II dominated. In paper A, anaxisymmetric model consisting 5 concentric cylinders that represent broken fiber withdebond, surrounding matrix, neighboring fibers, surrounding matrix and effectivecomposite was generated. It’s found that there are two stages of <b>debond</b> growth, thefirst stage is when <b>debond</b> length is short, the ERR decreases with increasing debondlength, and the presence of neighboring fibers significantly increase the ERR ofdebond. For relatively long <b>debond,</b> the <b>debond</b> growth is steady when ERR is almostconstant regardless of <b>debond</b> length. In steady state of <b>debond</b> growth, the presenceof neighboring fibers have little effect on the ERR. In papers B and C, a 3 -D modelwas generated with broken fiber and its 6 nearest fibers in a hexagonal packed UDcomposite were modelled explicitly, surrounded by the homogenized composite. Based on the obtained results, it’s shown that ERR is varying along <b>debond</b> front, andhas its maximum at the circumferential location where the distance between two fibercenter is the smallest. This indicates that the <b>debond</b> front is not a circle. For steadystate <b>debond,</b> the presence of neighboring fibers have little effect on averaged ERR(averages of ERR along <b>debond</b> front). For short <b>debond,</b> the presences ofneighboring fibers increases the averaged ERR, and that increase is more significantwhen inter-fiber distance is the smallest. Paper D investigates the growth of afiber/matrix <b>debond</b> along fiber circumference under transverse loading. It’s foundthat <b>debond</b> growth in this case is mixed-mode, and both mode I and mode II ERRcomponents increase with increasing <b>debond</b> angle and then decreases. Debondgrowth is mode I dominated for small <b>debond</b> angle and then switch to mode IIdominated. The presence of neighboring fibers have an enhancement effect on debondgrowth up to certain small <b>debond</b> angle and then changes to a protective effect. InPaper E, the interaction between two arc-size <b>debond</b> under transverse loading isinvestigated. It’s found that when two debonds are close to each other, the interactionbetween two <b>debond</b> becomes much stronger, and that interaction leads to the increaseof ERR of each <b>debond</b> significantly, which facilitates further growth for bothdebond...|$|E

40|$|For {{concrete}} beams retrofitted with bonded fiber {{reinforced plastic}} (FRP) composite plate, failure can occur due to <b>debonding</b> of the plate from the concrete surface. To predict the failure load in design, a proper model for FRP <b>debonding</b> is required. It is now commonly accepted that the <b>debonding</b> zone can be separated into two parts: a process zone within which the shear stress is decreasing with interfacial sliding, and a stress-free zone where the <b>debonded</b> surfaces have completely separated. Based on this physical understanding, the complete <b>debonding</b> process can be analysed once the shear stress vs shear displacement (tau-delta) relationship is known. In previous work, the tau-delta relation is often assumed to be bilinear.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the case}} of RC members {{strengthened}} with CFRP, two kinds of failure will occur: a premature failure which is a <b>debonding</b> failure of anchorage zone can be detected {{in addition to the}} <b>debonding</b> failure mode which is induced by the crack occurrence of RC beam. The <b>debonding</b> failure of the anchorage zone means the CFRP cannot be used efficiently, and even leads to the inactivation of RC beam strengthened with CFRP. The test and FEM analysis give regularities of distribution of the shear stress of <b>debonding</b> failure of anchorage zone of RC beam strengthened with CFRP. The regularities of distribution of the stress of <b>debonding</b> failure mode, which is induced by the crack occurrence of RC beam, are simulated by FEM analysis. The results will provide scientific laws for the prevention of premature failure of anchorage zone and sufficient utilization of tension strength of CFRP.

40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} cracking {{plays an}} important role in determining the final failure of unidirectional composites. In the present study, energy release rate (ERR) for fiber/matrix interface <b>debond</b> growth originated from fiber break in unidirectional composite is calculated using 5 -cylinders axisymmetric and 3 -D FEM models with hexagonal fiber arrangement. In the model the debonded fiber is central in the hexagonal unit which is surrounded by effective composite. The effect of neighboring fibers focusing on local fiber clustering on the ERR is analyzed by varying the distance between fibers in the unit. Two different scenarios are considered, one is the steady-state <b>debond</b> where <b>debond</b> are long and thus there is no interaction between <b>debond</b> tip and fiber break; the other case is when <b>debond</b> are relatively short when <b>debond</b> tip interacts with fiber break. The steady-state ERR is calculated from potential energy difference between a unit in the bonded region far away from the <b>debond</b> front and a unit in the debonded region far behind the <b>debond</b> front. The ERR for different modes of crack propagation is obtained from a FEM model containing a long <b>debond</b> by analyzing the stress at the <b>debond</b> front. For very short debonds, the ERR was calculated by both the J integral and the Virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). For steady-state <b>debond</b> growth, results show that in mechanical axial tensile loading fracture Mode II is dominating, it has strong angular dependence (effect of closest fibers) but the average ERR is not sensitive to the local fiber clustering. In thermal loading the Mode III is dominating and the average ERR is highly dependent on the distance to neighboring fibers. For short debod growth, results show that the <b>debond</b> growth is Mode II dominated and that the ERR strongly depends on the angular coordinate. The local fiber clustering has larger effect on the angular variation for shorter debonds and the effect increases with larger local fiber volume fraction. Finally, the ERR values from 5 -cylinder axisymmetric model could be considered as upper bound for the 3 -D hexagonal model.

An iterative solution was developed that used the stress intensities and strain-energy-release rates to predict crack and <b>debond</b> growths, respectively, on a cycle-by-cycle basis. A parametric study was made of the effects of boron-epoxy composite reinforcement on crack propagation in aluminum sheets. Results show that the size of the <b>debond</b> area has a significant effect on the crack propagation in the aluminum. For small <b>debond</b> areas, the crack propagation rate is reduced significantly, but these small debonds have a strong tendency to enlarge. <b>Debond</b> growth is most likely to occur in reinforced systems that have a cracked metal sheet reinforced with a relatively thin composite sheet...|$|E
40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics based approach {{was used to}} determine the <b>debond</b> energy or fracture toughness of the stem-cement interface for a variety of conditions. The goals of the study were to determine if early cementing of stems increased the <b>debond</b> energy of grit blasted stem-cement interfaces and if <b>debond</b> energy was dependent on mold type. Early (2 min) and late (6 min) times of cementation were considered for two different grit blasted surface finishes (16 and 60 grit, Ra= 5. 7 or 2. 3 microm). Specimen fabrication was performed using a relatively simple, unconstrained rectangular mold and a mold that more closely simulated in vivo conditions. The rectangular mold was used with all components at room temperature whereas the in vivo simulated mold had a body that resembled the femoral canal in shape and was warmed to body temperature. Early cementing did not increase the <b>debond</b> energy using the in vivo simulated mold. Extensive porosity was found at the interface, and porosity had a strong negative effect on <b>debond</b> energy. When the simpler, rectangular mold was used, early cementing did result in higher <b>debond</b> energies, but few voids were found at the interface. It appears that porosity at the interface was the major factor affecting the <b>debond</b> energy. The results from this study do not support the concept that improved stem-cement interface strength can be obtained by application of the cement while it is in a low viscosity state...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen a crack propagates {{towards a}} weak {{interface}}, interface <b>debonding</b> may occur before the incident crack reaches the interface. This phenomenon {{refers to the}} “Cook–Gordon mechanism”. In this investigation, an equivalent dynamic Cook–Gordon mechanism is studied both experimentally and analytically. Two strength-based criteria incorporating dynamic fracture mechanics analysis are proposed to predict the initiation location of interface <b>debonding</b> ahead of a dynamic incident crack. As validation, a comparison is made between the analytical predictions and experimental measurements. Results show that the strength-based criteria can effectively predict the initiation of interface <b>debonding.</b> Meanwhile, effects of the stress intensity factor and the T stress of the incident crack, on the interfacial <b>debonding</b> initiation are investigated. It is concluded that high-stress intensity factors of the incident cracks will easily induce interfacial <b>debonding</b> initiation, and changing the T stress is {{an effective way to}} control interfacial <b>debonding</b> initiation. Furthermore, high-interfacial tensile strengths rather than shear strengths, tend to suppress interfacial <b>debonding</b> initiation induced by a mode-I incident crack...|$|R
40|$|A dual eective-medium and finite-element {{study is}} carried out to examine the {{influence}} of interfacial partial deb-onding on the elastic stiness of a two-phase composite containing aligned elliptic fibers. In the eective-medium ap-proach double <b>debonding</b> {{on the top and}} bottom of the elliptic interface is considered, but in the finite-element approach both double and single <b>debonding</b> are examined. The eective-medium approach makes use of the concept of a fictitious fiber whose load-carrying capacity is taken to be lost in the <b>debonding</b> direction but remains intact in the transverse direction. The finite-element analysis allows one to examine further the influence of <b>debonding</b> angle on the stiness of the composite and it also provides the needed magnitude for this angle at which the eective-medium ap-proach applies. It is found that the angle has to be suciently wide, but not so wide as to lead to a potential complete <b>debonding.</b> Such an angle also increases when the fibers become more ribbon-like, but it decreases with increasing volume concentration. The basic assumption that the fictitious fiber has zero, or very low, load-carrying capacity along the <b>debonding</b> direction is also verified by the finite-element results. For both double and single <b>debonding</b> the Young’s modulus of the composite along the <b>debonding</b> direction can be significantly reduced as the <b>debonding</b> angle increases. The local stress distributions inside the fiber and the matrix are also illustrated for both types of <b>debonding.</b> Ó 200...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the influence of chemical-cure adhesives and light-cure adhesives on the stain susceptibility after <b>debonding</b> and the effects of different clean-up procedures on the stain susceptibility after <b>debonding.</b> Materials and methods: Seventy teeth specimens were randomly divided into seven groups of 10 teeth-Group 1 : no bonding (control group), Group 2 : bonding with light-cure adhesive, i. e. transbond XT and finishing with carbide bur after <b>debonding,</b> Group 3 : bonding with transbond XT and finishing with carbide bur and polishing with pumice and rubber cup after <b>debonding,</b> Group 4 : bonding with transbond XT and finishing with Sof-Lex disks after <b>debonding,</b> Group 5 : bonding with chemical-cure adhesive, i. e. unite and finishing with carbide bur after <b>debonding,</b> Group 6 : bonding with unite and finishing with carbide bur and polishing with pumice and rubber cup after <b>debonding,</b> Group 7 : bonding with unite and followed by <b>debonding</b> and finishing with Sof-Lex disks after <b>debonding.</b> The color parameters were measured on spectrophotometer before bonding and after methylene blue staining following <b>debonding</b> and clean-up procedures. Results: Comparing each clean-up procedure in both adhesive systems, color change for Group 6 (19. 59) was significantly higher than Group 3 (15. 00) (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Chemical-cure adhesive showed higher stain susceptibility than light-cure adhesive in all clean-up procedures. Both adhesives would show less stain susceptibility with polishing step with rubber cup and pumice...|$|R
