40|$|Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as potential building blocks for field effect transistor (FET) devices due to their quantum confinement bandgap. Here, we propose a novel GNR device concept, enabling the control of both charge and spin signals, integrated within the simplest three-terminal device configuration. In a conventional FET device, a gate electrode is employed to tune the Fermi level of the system {{in and out of}} a static bandgap. By contrast, in the switching mechanism proposed here, the applied gate voltage can dynamically open and close an <b>interaction</b> <b>gap,</b> with only a minor shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strong interplay of the band structure and edge spin configuration in zigzag ribbons enables such transistors to carry spin polarized current without employing an external magnetic field or ferromagnetic contacts. Using an experimentally validated theoretical model, we show that such transistors can switch at low voltages and high speed, and the spin polarization of the current can be tuned from 0 % to 50 % by using the same back gate electrode. Furthermore, such devices are expected to be robust against edge irregularities and can operate at room temperature. Controlling both charge and spin signal within the simplest FET device configuration could open up new routes in data processing with graphene based devices.

40|$|Abstract—The carboxyl-terminal {{domain of}} connexin 43 (Cx 43 CT) is {{involved}} in various intra- and intermolecular interactions that regulate gap junctions. Here, we used phage display to identify novel peptidic sequences that bind Cx 43 CT and modify Cx 43 regulation. We found that Cx 43 CT binds preferentially to peptides containing a sequence RXP, where X represents any amino acid and R and P correspond to the amino acids arginine and proline, respectively. A biased “RXP library ” led to the identification of a peptide (dubbed “RXP-E”) that bound Cx 43 CT with high affinity. Nuclear magnetic resonance data showed RXP-E–induced shifts in the resonance peaks of residues 343 to 346 and 376 to 379 of Cx 43 CT. Patch-clamp studies revealed that RXP-E partially prevented octanol-induced and acidification-induced uncoupling in Cx 43 -expressing cells. Moreover, RXP-E increased mean open time of Cx 43 channels. The full effect of RXP-E was dependent on {{the integrity of the}} CT domain. These data suggest that RXP-based peptides could serve as tools to help determine the role of Cx 43 as a regulator of function in conditions such as ischemia-induced arrhythmias.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis aims to enable robots to imitate humans. Learning by imitation is a fundamental part of human behaviour, since it allows humans to acquire motor skills simply by demonstration; seen from a robotic viewpoint you can easily “program” your fellow humans by showing them what to do. Would it not be great if the same mechanism {{could be used to}} program robots? A robot is programmed by specifying the torque of its motors. The torque can be regarded as the force or strength that is the result of muscles contracting or relaxing. Typical approaches to determine motor torques that will lead to a desired behaviour include setting them manually, i. e. on a trial-and-error basis, or specifying them by mathematical equations. Neither of these are intuitive to most humans, so most robot behaviours are programmed by engineers. However, if an engineer was to design a preprogrammed housekeeping robot, it would be very hard to program all the possible behaviours the robot could be expected to perform, even in such a limited domain. It is much more cost-efficient to make the robot learn what to do. This would allow the robot to adapt to its human owner, and not the other way around. Since humans easily learn new behaviours by imitating others, it would be ideal if humans could use the same technique to transfer motor knowledge to robots. I believe {{research in}} this area could be of great help to bridge the human-robot <b>interaction</b> <b>gap</b> that currently exists, so that you could have truly intelligent robots that could assist people in everyday life. To understand imitation learning, knowledge of psychology and neuroscience is required. The {{research in this}} thesis has taken an interdisciplinary approach, studying the desired mechanism on both a behavioural and neuroscientific level. I have focused on imitation in a musical setting. The system can both see and hear, and seeks to imitate the perceived behaviour. The application has been to create an intelligent virtual drummer, that imitates both the physical playing style (i. e. the movement of the arms) as well as the musical playing style (i. e. the groove) of the teacher. The virtual drummer will then both look and sound like a human drummer. The research in this thesis presents a multi-modal architecture for imitation of human movements. I have been working on simulated robots due to limits of time and money, however the principles of my research have been developed in a platformindependent way, so it should be applicable to real robots as well.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study focuses on cross-cultural communication experiences among international sojourners (IS) in Malaysian universities. Four research objectives were addressed : 1) {{to identify the}} transition shock symptoms in cross-culture communication faced by the international sojourners in Malaysian universities, 2) to determine the building blocks faced by international sojourners in cross-cultural transition, 3) to identify the aspects of perceived similarities or differences by international sojourners in their manifestations of culture 4) to ascertain the adaptation strategies embraced by international sojourners in overcoming cross-cultural communication challenges. Salient discoveries were obtained through in-depth interview with fifteen IS residing in Malaysian universities. The findings painted a vivid picture of the sojourning experiences. Firstly, the symptoms of transition shock were highly characterized by initial sojourning experiences, home separation struggles, emotional distress, initial communication-related stress and acclimatizing to surrounding. Initial sojourning anticipations contributed to themes of: i) unexpected encounters ii) felt differences iii) influences of past experiences. Home separation verify various struggles along the themes of : i) homesickness, ii) attachment need and iii) nostalgic feeling. Indications of emotional distress derived to themes of: i). affective upheavals, ii) yearning to leave and iii) challenged by strangeness. Initial communication-related symptom were salient in themes of : i) initial engagement challenges ii) <b>interaction</b> <b>gap,</b> and iii) withdrawal. Acclimatizing to the surroundings contributed to themes of : i) weather condition, and ii) food acceptance. Secondly, findings warranted the building blocks in cross-culture transition were associated to communication tribulations, language barriers and cross-cultural disputes. Communication tribulations contributed to themes of : i) predicaments in forming relationships, ii) arousing suspicion iii) nonverbal cues. Language barriers derived to themes of : i) interaction difficulties, ii) code substitute and iii) differences in the representation of meanings and pronunciation. Cross-cultural disputes persists in themes of: i) adapting to differences, ii) treatment against IS, iii) socially inappropriate behavior. Thirdly, aspects of perceived similarities or differences were manifested in value orientation and, cultural norms and rules. The themes were associated with : i) familial attachment, ii) society conformity and iii) interpersonal engagement. Likewise, cultural norms and rules subscribed to themes of i) appropriate standards of behavior and ii) attitude towards time and work commitment. Fourth, the strategies to overcome cross-cultural communication challenges were adjustment approach, cross-cultural resilience approach and passive-defensive approach. The adjustment approach uncovered four emerging themes: i) seek balance while preserving cultural identity, ii) negotiating cultural differences, iii) building relationships through communication and iv) local language acquisition. Cross cultural resilience approach contributed to themes of: i) receptive personality, ii) managing cross-cultural adversities and iii) avoid being judgmental. Passive defensive approach revealed two salient themes of : i) submission to circumstance and i) seeking shared-group support. In conclusion, across the nexus of cultural diversity lies the challenge to fathom the nuances between home and host culture.
