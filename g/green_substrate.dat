40|$|AbstractManagement {{of solid}} waste and {{wastewater}} in Namibia is a growing concern. This study investigated the biogas potential of slaughter waste at a small stock abattoir in southern Namibia. Laboratory experiments with five different mixes of blood; stomach content and manure from sheep were tested. Preliminary {{findings suggest that the}} most optimum mixture of slaughter waste was relatively large amounts of stomach and intestine content. The blood proportion should be kept relatively low, since the high nitrogen contents in the blood may inhibit the biogas production. The substrate mixture reflecting the actual ratio of waste generated in the slaughter process resulted in the highest methane production. This suggests {{that it is possible to}} produce viable amounts of biogas only using the waste produced at the abattoir, without adding other <b>green</b> <b>substrate.</b> Findings presented here together with results from a larger biogas digester, will be elaborated in the full paper...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} research is to develop large area pattern technique for ceramic <b>green</b> <b>substrates</b> using a modified roller laminator, which is compatible with screen printing apparatus, for integration of micro embossing and printing in the future stage. A thin film nickel mold was developed via photolithography, nickel electroplating and photoresist strip-off. The mold had an effective panel size of 150 mm × 150 mm with the height of protrusive micro patterns being about 40 µm. Formation of micro patterns was successfully demonstrated over the whole panel area using roller embossing on laminated ceramic green tapes (HL 2000 from Heraeus).

Composting {{seems to be an}} effective method for decontamination of such waste material. PAHs are degraded mainly under aerobic conditions the efficiency of composting could be strongly affected by the process conditions. This work is aimed at the comparison of PAH removal by a 340 -days-long composting in laboratory scale composting pilots and a 240 -days-long process in a pilot scale. To set up composting piles a "green substrate" commercially used for button-mushroom production and a grass substrate were used. The use of the grass substrate led to a higher PAHs removal (97 % of the initial sum of PAHs) in comparison to the <b>green</b> <b>substrate</b> (81 % of the initial sum of PAHs). Further, the effect of the size of wood particles on the PAHs removal efficiency was demonstrated. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acids showed an enhanced growth of gramm-negative bacteria and fungi during the composting processes. During the degradation process the enzyme activity of laccase was detected. The ecotoxicological test using a bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and a seed germination test using seeds of Hordeum vulgare L. showed that probably no toxic products were formed during the PAHs degradation in these experiments...|$|E
40|$|The European map {{butterfly}} (Araschnia levana L.) {{is a striking}} example of seasonal plasticity. Individuals of the spring generation are reddish with a fritillary-like colour pattern, whereas the summer generation is black with a white dorsal stripe. Proximate factors explaining {{the development of the}} forms are well known, but ultimate explanations have not been tested experimentally yet. The reddish spring form is assumed to have a warning coloration, as found in other nymphalid butterflies that are unpalatable (Aglais urticae). We tested for differential predation by a visually hunting predator (Parus major) in a laboratory experiment using artificial butterflies designed to represent the spring and summer form. Birds were released individually in a flight cage where the alternative forms were presented. Summer forms were more frequently attacked than spring forms, which may point to some aversion against the reddish spring form. But there was also a strong effect of the interaction between seasonal form and type of substrate. Spring forms were much better protected from attacks on the brown substrate of dead leaves compared to the <b>green</b> <b>substrate</b> of nettle leaves. On the latter substrate, latency times before attacking spring forms were on average 2. 5 times longer than for summer forms. Experiments with artificial butterflies simplify complex predator-prey interactions because they exclude potential taste or odour effects and they also exclude behavioural responses and interactions of the butterfly. However, our results based on static visual signals provide a promising first step to test the functional significance of this striking seasonal polyphenism...|$|E

40|$|Green roofs {{may make}} an {{important}} contribution to urban stormwater management. Rainfall-runoff models are required to evaluate green roof responses to specific rainfall inputs.

We found that large brick substrates had a lower water holding capacity than small brick (− 35 %), which led to decreased shoot growth (− 17 %) and increased root:shoot ratio (+ 16 %).

40|$|Climate {{features}} of the Mediterranean area make plant survival over green roofs challenging, thus calling for research work to improve water holding capacities of green roof systems. We assessed the effects of polymer hydrogel amendment on the water holding capacity of a <b>green</b> roof <b>substrate,</b> {{as well as on}} water status and growth of Salvia officinalis. Plants were grown in green roof experimental modules containing 8 cm or 12 cm deep substrate (control) or substrate mixed with hydrogel at two different concentrations: 0. 3 or 0. 6 %. Hydrogel significantly increased the substrate's water content at saturation, as well as water available to vegetation. Plants grown in 8 cm deep substrate mixed with 0. 6 % of hydrogel showed the best performance in terms of water status and membrane integrity under drought stress, associated to the lowest above-ground biomass. Our results provide experimental evidence that polymer hydrogel amendments enhance water supply to vegetation at the establishment phase of a green roof. In particular, the water status of plants is most effectively improved when reduced substrate depths are used to limit the biomass accumulation during early growth stages. A significant loss of water holding capacity of substrate-hydrogel blends was observed after 5 months from establishment of the experimental modules.

The modules were filled with commercial <b>green</b> roof <b>substrate</b> (80 % small particle sized crushed brick, 20 % green waste compost) to a depth of 100 mm. AMF inoculum was applied as four treatments: (i) directly with plug, (ii) mixed evenly into surrounding substrate, (iii) split between plug and substrate, (iv) control treatment with no inoculum added. Significantly greater levels of AMF colonisation of P. vulgaris roots was detected in all AMF treatments compared to the control. Low levels of AMF colonisation of P. vulgaris roots were also observed in the control treatment, confirming that low levels of AMF inoculum were present in this commercial substrate. Shoot phosphorous (P) concentration was improved in all AMF treatments, however there was no significant effect of any AMF treatment on P. vulgaris growth rate or biomass production. The highest AMF colonisation of P. vulgaris roots was observed when AMF inoculum was directly added to just the plug. Promisingly, P. vulgaris flowering time at the end of the first growing season was also extended in the plug AMF treatment only. This study has confirmed that commercial AMF inoculum can be used to successfully colonise plants and introduce AMF networks into <b>green</b> roof <b>substrate.</b> Although AMF inoculum was naturally present in the substrate used in this study, levels were extremely low, and unlikely to have any significant effect on plants.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) in resting Euglena gracilis strain Z during greening is photo-regulated (Freyssinet, Eichholz, Buetow 1984 Plant Physiol 75 : 850 - 857. Greening resting cells are not photosynthetically competent {{for about the}} first 24 hours in the light. Therefore, substrates for a net synthesis of the enzyme must come from endogenous constituents. During this time, degradation of endogenous paramylum (carbohydrate) reserves provides {{the main source of}} substrates. By about 24 hours of greening, resting cells are photosynthetically competent and RuBPCase accumulation becomes highly sensitive to 3 -(3, 4 dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. Therefore, from about 24 hours of <b>greening</b> onward, <b>substrates</b> (and/or energy) for RuBPCase synthesis are provided by photosynthesis. Ethanol, a nutritional substrate ordinarily used constitutively by Euglena for growth, inhibits RuBPCase accumulation when added to the resting medium in the light. The alcohol exerts this negative regulatory effect by limiting the availability of substrates needed for a net synthesis of the enzyme...|$|R
