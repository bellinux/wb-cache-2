As heat storage takes place inside the building where the loads occur, rather than at a central exterior location, the internal loads are removed {{without the need for}} additional transport energy. Distributed latent storage can thus be used to reduce the peak power demand of a building, downsize the cooling system, and/or switch to low-energy cool-ing sources. We used RADCOOL, a thermal building simulation program based on the finite dif-ference approach, to numerically evaluate the thermal performance of PCM wallboard in an office building environment.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} cost {{of electricity}} and the high demand charges levied by utility companies, thermal storage for cooling is rapidly becoming a widely recognized method to lower cooling costs. There are three maior types of thermal storage systems: ? Ice Storage: This utilizes the {{latent heat of fusion}} of ice for thermal storage. During off-peak periods, the refrigeration system is used to build ice. The ice is melted to produce chilled water when cooling is required. ? Chilled Water Storage: Chilled water is generated and stored during off-peak periods and used for cooling during on-peak hours.

The HVAC system uses different solutions according to the destination of each area: primary air and ceiling-mounted fan coils in the ground floor, and active chilled beams in the offices and meeting rooms. The AHU allows sensible heat recovery with an air-to-air cross-flow heat exchanger, and heat recovery from the heat pump condenser for summer humidity control.

Waste PCB contains substantial quantities of reusable materials and significant quantities of hazardous substances such as heavy metals, and brominated organic compounds. Molten salt gasification technology utilizing the high thermal conductivity and strong oxidizing property, provide a technically possiblility to decompose the polymers in PCB effectively, to destroy the brominated organic compounds completely and to prevent the release of organic contaminents. During the gasification process of PCB, the metal contents are detained in molten salt, and can be recovered by dealing with the salts. The molten salt gasification characterstics and metal recovery process of PCB were studied in this persent paper. Firstly the thermal decomposition process {{of a kind of}} brominted epoxy resin (BER) printed circuit boards was investigated by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS. The experimental results show that during the thermal decomposition process of BER, the brominated parts firtly degraded. The degradation of unbrominated parts happened at higher temperature and the pyrolysis products contained phenol, p-isopropylphenol, p-isopropenylacetylphenol, o-methylphenol and p-methylphenol. The effect of two different kinds of binary <b>eutectic</b> <b>salts</b> on the pyrolysis processes and pyrolysis products characterstics of PCB were studied with a bench scale molten salt reactor. The results show that the binary <b>eutectic</b> <b>salts</b> can decrease the liquid product yield. Consequently, the carbon conversion rate from PCB to gas products is increased greatly. The gasification experiment of PCB was carried out in a molten salt reactor. The results show that the main gas product of PCB molten salt gasification is H 2 and CO, which accounts for 70 vol% of total gas yield. The gas yield and carbon conversion rate increases with the equivalence ration. Along with the increase of the equivalence ration, the gas heating value decreaseed, and the gasification efficiency increased first and then decreased, which reach maximum 94 % when the equivalence ration is 20 %. The behavior of bromine during molten salt gasification were investigated. The results show that 73. 8 wt% bromine of feedstock has been neutralized and absorbed by molten salt, and only 0. 006 wt% bromine of feedstock was tested in gas products. The detention and distribute behavior of metal during molten salt gasification of PCB was investigated. The results show that over 90 % Cu, Al, Ca, Cd, Co, Mg, Sb, Sn, Zn was detained in molten salt. the metallic fraction could be recycled with collecting and dealing with the bottom layers of molten salt. For example, the materials recycled from the bottom layer contained 92. 76 wt% metal, including 78. 06 wt% Cu and 9. 89 wt% Al. Finally, a prediction model on the molten salt gasification of PCB was proposed based on reaction kinetics.

40|$|Cool storage {{technology}} {{can be used to}} significantly reduce energy costs by allowing energy intensive, electrically driven cooling equipment to be predominantly operated during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower. In addition, some system configurations may result in lower first costs and/or lower operating costs. Cool storage systems of one type or another could potentially be cost-effectively applied in most buildings with a space cooling system. A survey of approximately 25 manufacturers providing cool storage systems or components identified several thousand current installations, but less than 1 % of these were at Federal facilities. With the Federal sector representing nearly 4 % of commercial building floor space and 5 % of commercial building energy use, Federal utilization would appear to be lagging. Although current applications are relatively few, the estimated potential annual savings from using cool storage in the Federal sector is $ 50 million. There are many different types of cool storage systems representing different combinations of storage media, charging mechanisms, and discharging mechanisms. The basic media options are water, ice, and <b>eutectic</b> <b>salts.</b> Ice systems can be further broken down into ice harvesting, ice-on-coil, ice slurry, and encapsulated ice options. Ice-on-coil systems may be internal melt or external melt and may be charged and discharged with refrigerant or a single-phase coolant (typically a water/glycol mixture). Independent of the technology choice, cool storage systems can be designed to provide full storage or partial storage, with load-leveling and demand-limiting options for partial storage.

The specific aims of the project for this period were to identify appropriate eutectic salt mixture catalysts for the gasification of Illinois No. 6 coal, evaluate various impregnation or catalyst addition methods to improve catalyst dispersion, and evaluate gasification performance in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor. The project is being conducted jointly by Clark Atlanta University (CAU), the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) with CAU as the prime contractor. Several single salt catalysts and binary and ternary eutectic catalysts were investigated at Clark Atlanta University. Physical mixing and incipient wetness methods were investigated as catalyst addition techniques. Gasification was carried out using TGA at CAU and UTSI and with a fixed-bed reactor at UTSI. The results showed better gasification activity {{in the presence of}} the catalysts tested. The eutectic salt studies showed clear agreement between the melting points of the prepared eutectics and reported literature values. The order of catalytic activity observed was ternary > binary > single salt. With the soluble single salt catalysts, the incipient wetness method was found to give better results than physical mixing technique. Also, catalyst preparation conditions such as catalyst loading, drying time and temperature were found to influence the gasification rate. Based on the Clark Atlanta University studies on Task 1, the project team selected the 43. 5 %Li{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }- 31. 5 %Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }- 25 %K{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } ternary eutectic and the 29 %Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }- 71 %K{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and 2. 3 % KNO{sub 3 }- 97. 7 %K{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } binary eutectic for the fixed bed studies at UTSI. The <b>eutectic</b> <b>salts</b> were found to be highly insoluble in aqueous medium. As a result the technique of adding the eutectic to the raw coal was found to be better than using wet methods. Also, addition of the catalyst to the raw coal appeared to give better gasification results than addition to pyrolyzed coal. In addition, eutectic catalysts added to the coal yielded better gasification rates than rates obtained by mixing the individual salts in the eutectic ratio with the coal. These results, especially with the eutectic catalysts are very significant since the use of the low melting eutectics will reduce the severity of gasification processes...|$|E

A review of the collected literature was carried out. The catalysts which have been used for gasification can be roughly classified under the following five groups: alkali metal salts; alkaline earth metal oxides and salts; mineral substances or ash in coal; transition metals and their oxides and salts; and eutectic salt mixtures. Studies involving the use of gasification catalysts have been conducted. However, most of the studies focused on the application of individual catalysts. Only two publications have reported the study of gasification of coal char in CO 2 and steam catalyzed by eutectic salt mixture catalysts. By using the eutectic mixtures of salts that show good activity as individual compounds, the gasification temperature can be reduced possibly with still better activity and gasification rates due to improved dispersion of the molten catalyst on the coal particles. For similar metal/carbon atomic ratios, eutectic catalysts were found to be consistently more active than their respective single salts. But the exact roles that the eutectic salt mixtures play in these are not well understood and details of the mechanisms remain unclear. The effects of the surface property of coals and the application methods of eutectic salt mixture catalysts with coal chars on the reactivity of gasification will be studied. Based on our preliminary evaluation of the literature, a ternary eutectic salt mixture consisting of Li- Na- and K- carbonates has the potential as gasification catalyst. To verify the literature reported, melting points for various compositions consisting of these three salts and the temperature range over which the mixture remained molten were determined in the lab. For mixtures with different concentrations of the three salts, the temperatures at which the mixtures were found to be in complete molten state were recorded. By increasing the amount of Li 2 CO 3, the melting temperature range was reduced significantly. In the literature, the eutectic mixtures of Li- Na- and K-carbonates are claimed to have a lower activation energy than that of K 2 CO 3 alone and they remain molten at a lower temperature than pure K 2 CO 3. The slow increase in the gasification rates with eutectics reported in the literature is believed to be due to a gradual penetration of the coals and coal char particles by the molten and viscous catalyst phase. The even spreading of the salt phase seems to increase the overall carbon conversion rate. In the next reporting period, a number of <b>eutectic</b> <b>salts</b> and methods of their application on the coal will be identified and tested...|$|E

40|$|Nd-Fe-B-type die-upset magnet {{with high}} {{electrical}} resistivity was prepared by doping of eutectic DyF 3 –LiF salt mixture. Mixture of melt-spun Nd-Fe-B flakes (MQU-F: Nd 13. 6 Fe 73. 6 Co 6. 6 Ga 0. 6 B 5. 6) and eutectic binary (DyF 3 –LiF) salt (25 mol% DyF 3 – 75 mol% LiF) was hot-pressed and then die-upset. By adding the <b>eutectic</b> <b>salt</b> mixture (> 4 wt%), electrical resistivity of the die-upset magnet was enhanced to over 400 μΩ. cm compared to 190 μΩ. cm of the un-doped magnet. Remarkable enhancement of the electrical resistivity {{was attributed to}} homogeneous and continuous coverage of the interface between flakes by the easily melted <b>eutectic</b> <b>salt</b> dielectric mixture. It was revealed that active substitution of the Nd atoms in neighboring flakes by the Dy atoms from the added (DyF 3 –LiF) salt mixture had occurred during such a quick thermal processing of hot-pressing and die-upsetting. This Dy substitution led to coercivity enhancement in the die-upset magnet doped with the eutectic (DyF 3 –LiF) salt mixture.

Molten salt systems such as nitrides, nitrates and are widely used as heat transfer fluids (HTF) in CSP plants. HTF {{is one of the}} most important components for overall performance and efficiency of the CSP system. The heat transfer fluids currently used in CSP systems are either hydrocarbon oils or alkali- nitrate based eutectic slat mixtures. Both nitrate based salts and hydrocarbon oil have limited operating temperature and thermal. Hence there is a need to come up with a new heat transfer fluids made from inexpensive naturally abundant materials, which are stable up to 1000 ᵒC.
