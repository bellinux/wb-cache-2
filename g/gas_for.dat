5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, {{hydrogen}} is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> minute leak detection.

5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant <b>gas,</b> <b>for</b> example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|The uses of coal were varied. Coal {{was used}} in limekilns to produce lime for mortar used in {{building}} and by farmers to improve the soil. From 1820 coal was used to produce <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in the area. Coke was used to dry malt for the brewing industry.|$|E

This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural <b>Gas,</b> <b>for</b> about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.|$|E

5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops {{before it can be}} eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> efficient decompression.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s {{with the creation of}} the Russian Federation. In addition, due to the post-Soviet recession, much of the country's infrastructure, including dams, fell into disrepair. Use of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> energy took priority in Russia and renewable energy was ignored. This policy lasted until 2008, when Medvedev announced reforms to Russia's energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy. Since then, there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources.|$|E

5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had been further studied in the early 1960s {{and led to a}} new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more <b>gas</b> <b>for</b> the same volume.|$|E

The Scenic Railway was hit by an incendiary bomb and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from ack-ack guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|E
