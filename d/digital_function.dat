5000|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that glnA RNAs correspond to glutamine-binding riboswitches, i.e., they sense glutamine concentrations {{in order to}} measure overall nitrogen availability, and regulate the downstream genes appropriately. The original proposal of a riboswitch function was based on the above evidence that glnA RNAs are cis-regulatory, as well as the moderate structural complexity in the three-stem junction of the glnA RNA motif that is comparable to the structures of other known riboswitches. Some glnA RNAs are located adjacent to other glnA RNAs. These [...] "tandem arrangements" [...] are also exhibited by glycine riboswitches and TPP riboswitches where they allow the cell to turn genes off or on within a smaller change of concentration of the riboswitch ligand. In other words, the response curve of the riboswitch better resembles a <b>digital</b> <b>function.</b> [...] However, such cooperative binding was not observed.|$|E
50|$|For 3G, a {{distributed}} {{base station}} architecture {{was introduced by}} Nokia, Huawei and other leading telecom equipment vendors. In this architecture the radio function unit, {{also known as the}} remote radio head (RRH), is separated from the <b>digital</b> <b>function</b> unit, or baseband unit (BBU) by fiber. Digital baseband signals are carried over fiber, using Open Base Station Architecture Initiative (the OBSAI) or Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standard. The RRH can be installed on the top of tower close to the antenna, reducing the loss compared to the traditional base station where the RF signal has to travel through a long cable from the base station cabinet to the antenna {{at the top of the}} tower. The fiber link between RRH and BBU also allows more flexibility in network planning and deployment as they can be placed a few hundreds meters or a few kilometres away. Most modern base stations now use this decoupled architecture.|$|E

40|$|Tangible user {{interfaces}} (TUI) have gained {{popularity in the}} last few years, {{at the end of a}} process where the computer devices - especially in those contexts that are not related to the working activities - have lost deputed spaces and trained operators for mixing with the everyday activities of the casual users. TUI are appealing for many users because they promise to control and to access easily the state of digital systems without requiring a specialized environment or a long training for users. In spite of that, while in the last years different implementations have been realized and a number of frameworks have been proposed for guiding the design of TUI, most of the work done so far has not completely exploited the role of the shape of physical objects. This paper is part of a research work aimed at examining the potential of the morphology of the physical artifacts, for building meaningful mappings between physical artifacts and <b>digital</b> <b>functions.</b> In particular in our research we focus on examining the relations between the different types of surfaces that define an object and the different types of <b>digital</b> <b>functions,</b> discrete and continuous. While in our previous research we introduced a set of guidelines defining a specific mapping between the physical objects and the <b>digital</b> <b>functions</b> and we asked the users to evaluate them, in this work we involved them in the design phase for defining the mapping between a predefined set of physical objects and <b>digital</b> <b>functions.</b> The aim was twofold. On one side we considered our test as an educational activity, for improving the awareness of users (i. e., in this case they were also perspective interface designers) that all the interfaces, including TUI, are not natural but are the result of a design activity that may lead to good or bad results. On the other side we wanted to verify, in a situation characterized by scarcity of physical and digital resources, which physical and digital cues were considered as stronger by the users for specifying the mapping. While the exam of the behavior of the majority of the users confirmed the findings of our previous work, the test revealed also other behaviors triggered by the exploitation of other cues...|$|R

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the regional vertical ground reaction force in patients with and without plantar fasciitis.

The magnitude and timing of ground reaction force for the entire foot and for the regions of the rearfoot, midfoot, forefoot, and digits were measured for each limb. The findings indicate that patients with plantar fasciitis make gait adjustments that result in reduced force beneath the rearfoot and forefoot of the symptomatic foot.
