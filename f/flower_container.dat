5000|$|In 1579, {{at the age}} of 58, Rikyū {{became a}} tea master for Oda Nobunaga and, {{following}} Nobunaga's death in 1582, he was a tea master for Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His relationship with Hideyoshi quickly deepened, and he entered Hideyoshi's circle of confidants, effectively becoming the most influential figure in the world of chanoyu. In 1585, so he could help at a tea gathering that would be given by Hideyoshi for Emperor Ōgimachi and held at the Imperial Palace, the emperor bestowed upon him the Buddhist lay name and title [...] "Rikyū Koji" [...] (利休居士). Another major chanoyu event of Hideyoshi's that Rikyū {{played a central role in}} was the Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony, held by Hideyoshi at the Kitano Tenman-gū in 1587.It was during his later years that Rikyū began to use very tiny, rustic tea rooms referred as sō-an ("grass hermitage"), such as the two-tatami mat tea room named Tai-an, which can be seen today at Myōki-an temple in Yamazaki, a suburb of Kyoto, and which is credited to his design. This tea room has been designated as a National Treasure. He also developed many implements for tea ceremony, including <b>flower</b> <b>containers,</b> teascoops, and lid rests made of bamboo, and also used everyday objects for tea ceremony, often in novel ways.|$|R

An experiment was conducted to determine whether forcing containerized roses will be faster in a retractable roof greenhouse compared to outdoors. Results suggest that forcing roses in a retractable roof greenhouse can shorten the production time and increase quality of finished plants, however, cultivar, time of harvesting, and time in cold storage also affect these parameters...|$|R
50|$|More {{than simply}} putting <b>flowers</b> in a <b>container,</b> ikebana is a disciplined art {{form in which}} nature and {{humanity}} are brought together. Contrary {{to the idea of}} a particolored or multicolored arrangement of blossoms, ikebana often emphasizes other areas of the plant, such as its stems and leaves, and puts emphasis on shape, line, and form. Though ikebana is an expression of creativity, certain rules govern its form. The artist's intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece's color combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the implied meaning of the arrangement.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the developments {{in the area and}} volume of substrates used for horticultural rooting media in Holland in the period 2001 to 2005 is given. The overview is followed by a discussion of some trends in society and technology including the interest of public and society in a possible substitution of peat, an increase in the use of locally produced renewable carbon based substrates and an increase in nutrient recirculation for soil grown crops. In reaction to growing public concern about peat harvesting for horticultural purposes in parts of Europe, Dutch growers, researchers, potting soil producers, an auction and traders initiated in 2003 a research program named the New Growing Media Project. The aim was: To assess the technical and economical potential of peat alternatives. Develop experience and knowledge of growing on alternative mixtures. During 2004 and 2005, fifteen growers cultivated green and <b>flowering</b> <b>container</b> plants on alternative mixes. The 2004 season was used to test larger numbers of potting soils with relatively small numbers of plants. The 2005 season was used to test the most promising potting soils with larger numbers of plants. The results showed that for Hedera and Schefflera, the ultimate alternative mix was superior to the commercial standard used. For five species, Anthurium, Chrysanthemum, Gerbera, Spathiphyllum and Castanospermum, the alternative mix proved equal to the commercial standard. For eight species, Azalea, Guzmania, Poinsettia, Rosa, Saintpaulia, Adiantum, Crassula and Ficus, results were poorer than on the standard medium. The growers however, felt confident the alternative mixes could do better if the growing system, often the irrigation frequency, could be adapted to the experimental growing medium. Begonia gave poorer results with the new mix. The percentage peat used in the mixes was reduced from 77 % on average in the commercial standard mixes to 30 % on average in the new mixes. The most popular alternatives were coir products which increased from 17 to 40 %. Other alternatives used were various barks, rice hulls, perlite, wood fiber, composts, and rockwool granulate. Those alternatives were used in mixtures from 5 to 30 %. General conclusions include a growing interest in locally produced composts, granulates and fibers and for materials with properties such as a high initial air content combined with an improved rewetting rate...|$|R
50|$|Scadoxus multiflorus (formerly Haemanthus multiflorus) is a {{bulbous plant}} native {{to most of}} sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Somalia to South Africa. It is also native to Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman) and to the Seychelles. It is {{naturalized}} in Mexico and in the Chagos Archipelago. It is grown as an ornamental plant for its brilliantly coloured <b>flowers,</b> either in <b>containers</b> or in the ground in where the climate is suitable. There are three recognized subspecies. Strongly toxic like other Scadoxus species, {{it has been used}} as a component of arrow poisons and fishing poisons, as well as in traditional medicine. Common names, some of which are used for other species, include blood lily, ball lily, blood flower, Katherine-wheel, oxtongue lily, poison root and powderpuff lily.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{preparations}} {{take place}} on October 30 with family ofrendas laid out in homes. [...] Families have their own variations on the ritual but some things are common, the offerings of bread, <b>flowers,</b> candles, a <b>container</b> with water paired with a container of salt, incense and photographs. For the most part, the ritual {{is a mixture of}} pre-Hispanic and Catholic rites, with the addition of photographs being a modern touch. Mostly these offerings are made privately in homes on altars arranged for this day, but elements can be seen at the cemetery on the graves. One element that is local is a donut-shaped bread with a dark pink glaze called “roscas rosas” that are laid out along with pan de muertos. People open their doors here to invite the dead to visit.|$|R
50|$|Historically, little incisions {{were cut}} into the bride and groom's palms {{so that they could}} be joined in blood. As time progressed it was {{replaced}} with henna (also spelled as hennah). Henna is a plant and which is use for dying hair, fingernails, leather, and wool. Henna is considered more sanitary and less messy. At this moment a girl dressed in traditional Afghan clothes would come through the door with a silver tray with candles and an assortment of fresh <b>flowers</b> with little <b>containers</b> of henna dancing and twirling {{all the way to the}} bride and groom. The mother of the groom would place a teaspoon full of henna onto the bride's palm and cover it with a triangular cloth made of fine and shiny fabric. The bride's mother would place the henna on the pinkie finger of the groom and likewise cover it with the fabric.|$|R
40|$|Cemeteries {{with many}} water-filled <b>containers,</b> <b>flowers,</b> sources of human blood, and shade are fa-vorable urban {{habitats}} for {{the proliferation of}} Aedes aegypti, a vector of yellow fever and dengue. A total of 22, 956 containers was examined in the five cemeteries {{of the city of}} Buenos Aires, Argentina. The vector was found in four cemeteries that showed an average infestation level of 5. 5 % (617 positive out of 11, 196 water-filled containers). The four cemeteries positive for Ae. aegypti showed significantly different (p< 0. 01) infestation levels. Vegetation cover and percentage of infestation were significantly correlated (p< 0. 01), but neither cemetery area nor number of available containers were significantly related to the proportion of positive vases. Our results suggest that the cemeteries of Buenos Aires represent a gradient of habitat favorableness for this vector species, some of which may act as foci for its proliferation and dispersal...|$|R
25|$|In 1475 a huge altarpiece of the Adoration of the Shepherds {{arrived in}} Florence. Painted by Hugo van der Goes {{at the behest}} of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and {{installed}} in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a still life of <b>flowers</b> in contrasting <b>containers,</b> one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. Domenico Ghirlandaio promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.|$|R

The Kentucky State University (KSU) Sunflower Project celebrates KSU’s 130 th anniversary {{and gives}} {{continued}} support for small farmers and gardeners. The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) {{is a beautiful}} and versatile flowering plant that can be grown for food or for ornamental purposes. Sunflowers grown for seed can be classified as either an oil type or confection (non-oil) type, {{each with its own}} distinct market. Ornamental sunflowers can be dwarf or tall for cut <b>flower</b> or <b>container</b> production; these <b>flowers</b> have great variation in color and form. Sunflowers grow well in a variety of soil types and can be used to smother weeds in cover crop systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a range of ornamental sunflowers grown in Kentucky for cut flower consumer preference. Seven sunflower cultivars were grown in one gallon pots in the Kentucky State University Harold R. Benson Research and Demonstration Farm greenhouses including the selections: ‘Infared Mix’, ‘Sunny Smile’, ‘Procut Red’, ‘Choco Sun’, ‘Fun N Sun Hybrid’, ‘Evening Sun Mix’, and ‘Premium Light Yellow’. Vases were numbered in a blind labeling system, flowers from each variety were placed in vases, and participants rated each selection for color, size, shape, and overall appearance on a 1 (being poor) to 5 (being excellent) scale. Demographic information was also collected from participants. There were significant differences in preference for color, size, shape, and overall appearance for the selections. Choco Sun had the most desirable color, size, shape, and overall appearance compared to the other selections. Infared Mix, Fun N Sun Hybrid, and Premium Light Yellow were poorly ranked in color and overall appearance...|$|R
40|$|Given {{their medical}} and {{veterinary}} relevance, {{the members of}} the Pipiens Assemblage are a worldwide target of ecological research. The distribution of Culex pipiens s. s. and Cx. quinquefasciatus converge in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where hybrids have been detected. Each member of the assemblage exhibits a distinct eco-physiological behaviour that can affect its efficiency in pathogen transmission. Our aim was to identify the environmental drivers for the spatio-temporal distribution of each member, focusing on latitudinal and urbanisation gradients. Immatures of mosquitoes were surveyed in artificial containers found within 11 public cemeteries, raised up to the adult stage and identified by their male genitalia. The distribution of each member was associated with the environment in a Generalized Linear Model. The variable accounting for most of the heterogeneity was latitude; Cx. quinquefasciatus was collected more frequently at northern cemeteries, whereas Cx. pipiens and hybrids were more likely at the southern extreme. The urbanisation gradient was also associated with the occurrence of Cx. quinquefasciatus and hybrids at the high and low end, respectively. Other relevant variables were cemetery total area, the proportion with graves and the presence of plastic <b>flowers</b> in the <b>containers.</b> The spatial distribution of {{the members of the}} Pipiens Assemblage within the sympatric region in South America is driven by environmental features. The information presented herein provides essential baseline data for surveillance programs and control activities...|$|R
