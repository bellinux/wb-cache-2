The hooks are not cosmetically intractable. They only are used for controlling body-powered devices. Prehensors are between hooks and artificial hands. Prosthetic prehensors are not cosmetically appealing and {{are in the same}} family as body-powered prostheses, such as prosthetic hooks. The unique types of connective devices are made to benefit amputees interested in recreational or sport activities.|$|E
40|$|In natural orifice transluminal {{endoscopic}} surgery (NOTES) the peritoneal cavity is reached through natural orifices (mouth, rectus and transvaginal duct), {{by means of}} little cuttings in the walls of hollow organs. Due to narrow spaces, NOTES needs robotic systems to assure operation/movement precision and patient safety. Variable stiffness actuation (VSA) assures both requirements. Methods The authors developed a grasper for NOTES, provided with VSA, to use as an endeffector for snail robot devices. The present paper deals with basic concepts of VSA and describes the design and architecture of the grasper. Characterization and functional experiments were performed and results analysed. Results A finite element model developed for the actuator design was validated, performance grasper characteristic curves were obtained, VSA was validated, and the <b>gripping</b> <b>capability</b> of several objects was assessed. Conclusion The grasper satisfies technical design specifications. On {{the basis of the}} results obtained, a control system can be developed to test grasper in a simulated surgery environment...|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{developing}} a cosmesis solution that maintains mechanical and environmental durabil-ity while minimizing mechanical drag and allowing sensor function was {{the crux of the}} challenge. For the BACKGROUND A cosmesis is the last component to be placed on a prosthetic arm, hand, or both, and it is the first com-ponent that others interact with, either visually or by contact. Historically, the cosmesis has had two primary functions. The first has been to provide a cosmetic cover over the nonhuman-appearing mechanism of the pros-thetic limb. This cover helps the patient feel more com-fortable in social settings (Fig. 1). The second function has been to provide a better gripping surface than that of the underlying mechanism for the hand to promote picking up and holding objects. In the work described in this article, we imposed other requirements, such as pro-viding a first barrier against the environment and allow-ing sensors to measure force, vibration, and temperature through the cosmesis. cosmesis fulfills multiple functions, from providing a cos-metic covering to increase social acceptance to improving the <b>gripping</b> <b>capability</b> of a prosthetic hand. This article explores the requirements imposed on the cosmesis developed for the Revolutionizing Prosthetics (RP) 2009 program and looks at the dual glove-solution path that evolved during the development and testing. The requirements are drivers for the materials selection, and the processing method that was selected is an evolution of traditional cosmesis fabrication. Future directions in cosmesis fabrication are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the U. S. energy reserves and lower costs for finding and retrieving oil, the USDOE created a solicitation to encourage industry to focus on means to operate in small diameter well-Microhole. Partially {{in response to this}} solicitation and because Western Well Tool's (WWT) corporate objective to develop small diameter coiled tubing drilling tractor, WWT responded to and was awarded a contract to design, prototype, shop test, and field demonstrate a Microhole Drilling Tractor (MDT). The benefit to the oil industry and the US consumer from the project is that with the MDT's ability to facilitate Coiled Tubing drilled wells to be 1000 - 3000 feet longer horizontally, US brown fields can be more efficiently exploited resulting in fewer wells, less environmental impact, greater and faster oil recovery, and lower drilling costs. Shortly after award of the contract, WWT was approached by a major oil company that strongly indicated that the specified size of a tractor of 3. 0 inches diameter was inappropriate and that immediate applications for a 3. 38 -inch diameter tractor would substantially increase the usefulness of the tool to the oil industry. Based on this along with an understanding with the oil company to use the tractor in multiple field applications, WWT applied for and was granted a no-cost change-of-scope contract amendment to design, manufacture, assemble, shop test and field demonstrate a prototype a 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. Utilizing existing WWT tractor technology and conforming to an industry developed specification for the tool, the Microhole Drilling Tractor was designed. Specific features of the MDT that increase it usefulness are: (1) Operation on differential pressure of the drilling fluid, (2) On-Off Capability, (3) Patented unique gripping elements (4) High strength and flexibility, (5) Compatibility to existing Coiled Tubing drilling equipment and operations. The ability to power the MDT with drilling fluid results in a highly efficient tool that both delivers high level of force for the pressure available and inherently increases downhole reliability because parts are less subject to contamination. The On-Off feature is essential to drilling to allow the Driller to turn off the tractor and pull back while circulating in cleanout runs that keep the hole clean of drilling debris. The gripping elements have wide contact surfaces to the formation to allow high loads without damage to the formation. As part of the development materials evaluations were conducted to verify compatibility with anticipated drilling and well bore fluids. Experiments demonstrated that the materials of the tractor are essentially undamaged by exposure to typical drilling fluids used for horizontal coiled tubing drilling. The design for the MDT was completed, qualified vendors identified, parts procured, received, inspected, and a prototype was assembled. As part of the assembly process, WWT prepared Manufacturing instructions (MI) that detail the assembly process and identify quality assurance inspection points. Subsequent to assembly, functional tests were performed. Functional tests consisted of placing the MDT on jack stands, connecting a high pressure source to the tractor, and verifying On-Off functions, walking motion, and operation over a range of pressures. Next, the Shop Demonstration Test was performed. An existing WWT test fixture was modified to accommodate operation of the 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. The fixture simulated the tension applied to a tractor while walking (pulling) inside 4. 0 inch diameter pipe. The MDT demonstrated: (1) On-off function, (2) Pulling forces proportional to available differential pressure up to 4000 lbs, (3) Walking speeds to 1100 ft/hour. A field Demonstration of the MDT was arranged with a major oil company operating in Alaska. A demonstration well with a Measured Depth of approximately 15, 000 ft was selected; however because of problems with the well drilling was stopped before the planned MDT usage. Alternatively, functional and operational tests were run with the MDT inside 4. 5 inch tubing at depths of 800 - 950 ft. The MDT successfully demonstrated On-Off capability, pulled with up to 1465 lbs force, and verified its capability to transmit torque though it from the Orienter. Forces generated by the tractor were limited due to insufficient differential pressure because of the unloaded downhole motor, which is not typical during drilling conditions. Additionally, the Coefficient of Friction between the MDT grippers and the tubing was much less than the anticipated COF of the sandstone formation. Despite these minor limitations, to summarize the MDT operated as expected. Minor modifications to the MDT are being incorporated to improve <b>gripping</b> <b>capability</b> of the tractor. Additional demonstration wells are being arranged to expand on the project's goals of delivering a fully operational utilitarian tool for use throughout the US to improve reserves...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} grasp and {{manipulate}} objects {{is fundamental to}} many {{activities of daily living}} required to maintain independence and quality of life. Physical <b>grip</b> <b>capabilities</b> decline with age; and the functional effect of this can be worsened by environmental barriers. Inclusive design brings a thoughtful approach to the design of products and environments offsetting this decline to ameliorate independent living in later life. As yet, however, little systematic research exists on the effects of object properties on older adults’ reach-­‐to-­‐grasp performance. This thesis addresses that gap by exploring the impact of object friction and size on the reach-­‐to-­‐grasp capabilities of older and younger adults, and how these differ. The research gave an active voice to older adults through focus groups to divulge their difficulties in daily activities that they ascribed to ageing, which provided context to the experimental research. A series of experiments were used to compare the reach-­‐to-­‐grasp behaviour of older and younger adults, and how object size and friction affected this. The research demonstrates that older people adopt slower reach-­‐to-­‐grasp actions in pinch and power grasp, partly due to their lower dexterity. This care, which they acknowledge, is reflected in a more sequential movement, though they exhibit similar grip forces to the younger participants, and participants of all ages scaled their movement and force to object size and friction. Inclusive design sometimes uses impairment simulators, such as the Cambridge Impairment Simulator Gloves, to help designers understand and empathise with impaired <b>grip</b> <b>capability.</b> Accordingly, the research explored the influence of these gloves on the reach-­‐to-­‐grasp behaviour of young adults relative to that of older users. It was found that by lowering young adults’ hand dexterity they forced them to reach-­‐to-­‐grasp performances similar to older adults, allowing the supposition that reduced hand dexterity could partly explain older people’s approach...|$|R

Impulse and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes.

However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of A. afarensis remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning {{that there is a}} trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize.|$|R

This paper presents a novel {{solution to the problem of}} estimating and tracking the 3 D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of miniaturized grippers from RGB marker-less visual observations obtained by a microscope. We consider this as an optimization problem, seeking for the gripper model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between hypothesized instances of the gripper model and actual observations of the miniaturized gripper. This optimization problem is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences showing the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material...|$|R

40|$|The {{human hand}} is unparalleled amongst {{primates}} {{in its ability}} to manipulate objects forcefully and dexterously. Previous research has predominantly sought to explain the evolution of these capabilities through an adaptive relationship between more modern human-like anatomical features in the upper limb and increased stone tool production and use proficiency. To date, however, we know little about the influence that other manipulatively demanding behaviors may have had upon the evolution of the human hand. The present study addresses one aspect of this deficiency by examining the recruitment of the distal phalanges during a range of manual transportation (i. e. carrying) events related to hominin behavioral repertoires during the Plio-Pleistocene. Specifically, forces on the volar pad of each digit are recorded during the transportation of stones and wooden branches that vary in weight and size. Results indicate that in most instances, the index and middle fingers are recruited to a significantly greater extent than the other three digits during carrying events. Relative force differences between digits were, however, dependent upon the size and weight of the object transported. Carrying behaviors therefore appear unlikely to have contributed to the evolution of the robust thumb anatomy observed in the human hand. Rather, results suggest that the manual transportation of objects may plausibly have influenced the evolution of the human <b>gripping</b> <b>capabilities</b> and the 3 rd metacarpal styloid process...|$|R

40|$|Over recent years, the reseach in {{the field}} of soft {{actuation}} has been extensively increased for achieving more complex motion path with smooth, high flexible movement and high generated force at minimum operating pressure. This paper presents the study on <b>gripping</b> force <b>capability</b> of soft actuators applied on glove-type finger exoskeleton, developed in motivation to assist individuals having weak finger gripping ability in their rehabilitation exercise towards hand function restoration. The exoskeleton utilizes five cylindrical shaped pneumatic bending actuators developed in the lab, which use fiber reinforcement as a cause of bending motion that drive finger’s flexion movement. Four right-handed healthy volunteers simulated paralysis participated in the study. At 200 kPa safe operating pressure, the soft exoskeleton worn by the subjects demonstrates the ability to provide adequate grip force. The grip force generated from exoskeleton worn on passive right hand is 4. 66 ± 0. 2 N and 3. 61 ± 0. 2 N from passive left hand, both higher than the minimum grip forces measured to hold the Hand Dynamometer of 240 g.

40|$|Objective: To do a {{quantitative}} systematic review, including published and unpublished data, examining the associations between individual objective measures of physical <b>capability</b> (<b>grip</b> strength, walking speed, chair rising, and standing balance times) and mortality in community dwelling populations. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: Relevant studies published by May 2009 identified through literature searches using Embase (from 1980) and Medline (from 1950) and manual searching of reference lists; unpublished results {{were obtained from}} study investigators. Study selection: Eligible observational studies were those done in community dwelling people of any age that examined the association {{of at least one}} of the specified measures of physical <b>capability</b> (<b>grip</b> strength, walking speed, chair rises, or standing balance) with mortality. Data synthesis: Effect estimates obtained were pooled by using random effects meta-analysis models with heterogeneity between studies investigated. Results: Although heterogeneity was detected, consistent evidence was found of associations between all four measures of physical capability and mortality; those people who performed less well in these tests were found to be at higher risk of all cause mortality. For example, the summary hazard ratio for mortality comparing the weakest with the strongest quarter of grip strength (14 studies, 53 ? 476 participants) was 1. 67 (95 % confidence interval 1. 45 to 1. 93) after adjustment for age, sex, and body size (I 2 = 84. 0 %, 95 % confidence interval 74 % to 90 %; P from Q statistic < 0. 001). The summary hazard ratio for mortality comparing the slowest with the fastest quarter of walking speed (five studies, 14 ? 692 participants) was 2. 87 (2. 22 to 3. 72) (I 2 = 25. 2 %, 0 % to 70 %; P= 0. 25) after similar adjustments. Whereas studies of the associations of walking speed, chair rising, and standing balance with mortality have only been done in older populations (average age over 70 years), the association of grip strength with mortality was also found in younger populations (five studies had an average age under 60 years). Conclusions: Objective measures of physical capability are predictors of all cause mortality in older community dwelling populations. Such measures may therefore provide useful tools for identifying older people at higher risk of death...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{robotics}} and automatic assembly tooling, it is often necessary to provide some compliance when fitting two parts together or when engaging a tool with a complementarily shaped aperture. This need arises because of the tolerances in <b>gripping</b> and positioning <b>capability</b> of a robot arm and the dimensional tolerances of the members being positioned. The use of excessive force to engage two imperfectly aligned members can lead to damage to the members or assembly tooling. A remote centre compliance (RCC) is a device that can provide a compliance center projected outward from the device. Remote compliance centers decouple lateral and angular motion. A RCC device {{can be used in}} assembly to ease the insertion force. When a project compliance center is near the insertion point of a peg-in-hole type assembly, the peg translates into the hole when it strikes the outside lead-in chamfer without rotating. This translation without rotation prevents the jamming and galling seen from compliance devices that have a compliance center far away from the insertion point. The proposed work aims at designing and developing an intelligent RCC device which helps the parts assemble even if there are misalignments of known limits and is capable of capturing useful information for the assembly process...|$|R

The NZ V8 series focuses on cost containment and control {{to make sure that the}} series is not dominated by one make or team. It is technically more basic than the Supercars, but also tends to be a bit more spectacular with a lot more close-action racing due to limited <b>grip</b> and braking <b>capabilities.</b> Unlike the Supercars, the NZV8 races are all sprint races so there is no requirement for elaborate pit crew setups. (In previous years a 500 km endurance race was run, but this has been dropped).

A number of Australian Supercars drivers now race in the NZV8's such as David Besnard, Luke Youlden and Cameron McLean for example, as the series has come to be recognised as an outstanding class in its own right, rather than a poor cousin of the Australian V8 Supercars.

However, evidence for associations with measures of cognitive performance in adults without dementia has been mixed, as it is for physical performance. Associations may also be evident in other genotypes implicated in LDL-C levels. As part of the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme, genotypic information was obtained for APOE ε 2 / 3 / 4, rs 515135 (APOB), rs 2228671 (LDLR) and rs 629301 (SORT 1) from eight cohorts of adults aged between 44 and 90 +years. We investigated associations with four measures of cognitive (word recall, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency and search speed) and physical <b>capability</b> (<b>grip</b> strength, get up and go/walk speed, timed chair rises and ability to balance) using meta-analyses. Overall, little evidence for associations between any of the genotypes and measures of cognitive capability was observed (e. g. pooled beta for APOE ε 4 effect on semantic fluency z score=- 0. 02; 95 % CI=- 0. 05 to 0. 02; p value= 0. 3; n= 18, 796). However, there was borderline evidence within studies that negative effects of APOE ε 4 on nonverbal ability measures become more apparent with age. Few genotypic associations were observed with physical capability measures. The findings from our large investigation of middle-aged to older adults in the general population suggest that effects of APOE on cognitive capability are at most modest and are domain- and age-specific, while APOE has little influence on physical capability. In addition, other LDL-C-related genotypes have little impact on these traits. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R
