In this dissertation a wide dynamic-range variable-gain transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is introduced. It adopts a regulated cascode (RGC) amplifier and an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) as the <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gain</b> element to control gain and improve the overload of the optical receiver. A fully-differential variable-gain TIA in a 0. 35 ?m CMOS technology is realized. It provides a bit error rate (BER) less than 10 - 12 for an input current from 6 ?A- 3 mA at 3. 3 V power supply. For the transimpedance gain variation, from 0. 1 k?? to 3 k??, - 3 dB bandwidth is higher than 1. 7 GHz for a 0. 6 pF photodiode capacitance. The power dissipations for the highest and the lowest gains are 8. 2 mW and 24. 9 mW respectively. A new technique for designing uniform multistage amplifiers (MA) for high frequency applications is introduced. The proposed method uses the multi-peak bandwidth enhancement technique while it employs identical, simple and inductorless stages. It has several advantages, such as tunability of bandwidth and decreased sensitivity of amplifier stages, to process variations. While all stages of the proposed MA topology are identical, the gain-bandwidth product can be extended several times. Two six-stage amplifiers in a TSMC 0. 35 ?m CMOS process were designed using the proposed topology. Measurements show that the gain can be varied for the first one between 16 dB and 44 dB within the 0. 7 - 3. 2 GHz bandwidth and for the second one between 13 dB and 44 dB within a 1. 9 - 3. 7 GHz bandwidth with less than 5. 2 nV/?Hz noise. Although the second amplifier has a higher gain bandwidth product, it consumes more power and occupies a wider area. A technique for capacitance multiplication is utilized to design a tunable loop filter. Current and voltage mode techniques are combined to increase the multiplication factor (M). At a high input dynamic range, M is adjustable and the capacitance multiplier performs linearly at high frequencies. Drain-source voltages of paired transistors are equalized to improve matching in the current mirrors. Measurement of a prototype loop filter IC in a 0. 5 ?m CMOS technology shows 50 ?A current consumption for M= 50. Where 80 pF capacitance is employed, the capacitance multiplier realizes an effective capacitance varying from 1. 22 nF up to 8. 5 nF...|$|E
40|$|To {{speed the}} {{recovery}} of brain injured children using the method of patterning; it must be made efficient. Efficiency {{can be achieved by}} automating the manual method, which will provide the patients with the necessary stimuli needed to help them enhance/restore their natural mobility. This thesis describes research into a novel moderate-cost single-axis Mechatronics device for the remedial treatment of brain injured patients. The device will enhance and/or improve their natural mobility by stimulating the undamaged brain cells responsible for mobility in the central nervous system through physical activity. A detailed review of rehabilitation robotics was undertaken, covering more than seventy projects relating to disabled people. This review helped to identify the main areas of this research regarding the most suitable structure of the machine and setting up the design specifications for the device. A critical investigation of past and present patterning machines and workstations helped avoid the mistakes made by previous designers in not including brain-injured patients in the initial stages of the design. Use of high technology video equipment has made practicable the development of mathematical expressions based on experimental data for the movements of human arms, feet and head. Measurements taken and ergonomic data used made it possible to implement a realistic practical novel kinematic arrangement for the patterning machine. A thorough review of direct drive electrical actuators, and surveys and measurements of the human body with respect to the kinematic arrangements, resulted in the selection of the most appropriate actuator for each axis. The selection of the motor and gearbox was based on the mass of each part of the human body in the prone position, the criteria of high peak torque to motor ratio, low cost, minimum maintenance, safety and compatibility. A computer model of the kinematic arrangement designed was created including the necessary motion constrains, using ADAMS and 3 D Working Model simulation packages to test, verify and analyse the static and dynamic stability of the kinematic arrangements and the force interaction between the system and the patient. The simulation results led to some modification in the design regarding the kinematics and dynamic stability of the system by varying different design variables. A walking model of a human was created to simulate the real patient. The model was placed on two units where the feet were the only contact points with the moving belts; the model torso was supported by a harness to hold it in the upright standing position. The results obtained showed the movements of both feet (knees. hips and ankles) in addition to the right and left elbows. The system hardware was designed and implemented using custom-made safety critical software to control the device to carry out the desired tasks.

The assignment text states that the following tools can be used to develop the control structure: <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> control, <b>gain</b> scheduling, first and second order filters, PI- and PID-controllers. A process model containing all process variables is derived in the report. For verification purposes and development of control structure and tuning, the model is implemented in MATLAB and Simulink where simulations are done. The model is normalised such that the control structure is tested for the general case. Plant verification model is based on dimensions from a real plant, but process parameters are changed for comparing with other plants. Tools like gain scheduler, anti-windup, derivative filter and low pass filter are derived and designed for the purpose. The report shows which parameters that limit the process performance and which techniques that should be used to reduce their impact to the system. There is also made analysis for how control loops and the controller can regard the limitations. An important part of this is the development of a signal filter to reduce measurement noise in the system. As a basis for controller tuning SIMC is used. The system is analysed to find a method adapted for separator tuning. The customised method is tested for different plants and compared to SIMC to verify the abilities to control the plant.
