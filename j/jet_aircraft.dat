5|$|In {{its current}} role No.79 Squadron's main {{responsibility}} is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School. During this training, new pilots who have been selected to fly <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> combat tactics. In 2004, each of No.79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks. After completing their initial <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> training, pilots transfer to No.76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted {{to one of the}} RAAF's operational conversion units. No.79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F/A-18F Super Hornets. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F-111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010. No.79 Squadron also provides refresher training on the Hawk aircraft for experienced fighter pilots.|$|E

5|$|By January 1944 the Soviets {{were aware}} of {{successful}} British and American <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> projects and that the Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People's Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As {{a result of this}} meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux (OKBs) to develop and build <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942.|$|E
5|$|For the 12-month period ending January 1, 2009, {{the airport}} had 163,984 {{aircraft}} operations, {{an average of}} 449 per day: 44% air taxi, 18% general aviation, 37% scheduled commercial, and 1% military. There are 92 aircraft based at this airport: 46% single engine, 16% multi-engine, 37% <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and 1% helicopters.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{based on}} the notion that Coandă invented the first jet, the centennial of the <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> was celebrated in Romania. A special coin and stamp were issued, and {{construction}} began on a working replica of the aircraft. At the European Parliament, an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the Coandă-1910.|$|E

Limited cargo activity is now maintained through JAL's passenger aircraft lower deck holds.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's flight crew {{and the air}} traffic controllers, trying {{to piece together the}} scenario which allowed two modern <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft,</b> equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E
5|$|She {{returned}} to San Francisco on 10 September 1946, embarked Carrier Air Group 19 flying the Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter. With this complement, Boxer {{began a series}} of peacetime patrols and training missions off the coast of California during a relatively uneventful period during 1947. In spite of manning difficulties brought on by the demobilization of the US military after World War II, Boxer remained active in Pacific readiness drills around the West Coast and Hawaii. In 1948, she conducted a number of short cruises with US Navy Reserve personnel. On 10 March 1948, a North American FJ-1 Fury launched from Boxer, the first such launch of an all-jet aircraft from an American carrier, which allowed subsequent tests of <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier doctrine. For the remainder of 1948 and 1949, she participated in numerous battle drills and acted as a training carrier for <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> pilots.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
5|$|When {{facilities}} {{reached their}} maximum capacity, {{the need for}} upgrades became necessary for the airport to continue to grow. A proposal for runway expansion as well as facilities upgrades was developed in 1975, but was subsequently put on hold while a new regional airport was being studied to serve both Roanoke and all of Southwest Virginia. During this time airline deregulation was put in place, and combined with the airport's aging facilities and the phasing out of turbo prop aircraft in favor of <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> by the airlines, the airport's outdated infrastructure and deteriorating condition resulted in a decline {{of service to the}} airport. In order to allow for larger, <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> to land, a runway expansion began in the early 1980s. With the runway extension underway, the airport officially changed its name from Roanoke Municipal Airport to Roanoke Regional Airport in 1983. The runway expansion project was completed in 1985.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1942, German flak commanders had already {{concluded}} that AAA would be essentially useless against <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and began development of guided missiles {{to fill this}} role. Most forces reached the same conclusion soon after, with both the US and UK starting missile development programs before the war ended. The UK's Green Mace {{was one of the}} last attempts to develop a useful high-altitude AAA weapon, but its development ended in 1957.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2016, as {{the most}} used high bypass turbofan, it {{achieved}} more than 800million engine flight hours, and {{at a rate of}} one million flight hours every eight days it will achieve one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> are in the air at any moment. It is known for its dependability: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first shop visit, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War air power had been {{supplemented}} by the introduction of the jet engine, which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World War II predecessors, the newer <b>jet</b> <b>aircraft</b> proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.|$|E
