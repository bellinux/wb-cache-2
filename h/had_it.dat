John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches.

5|$|After the war, Puglia {{had been}} {{assigned}} to patrol the Dalmatian coast. On 11 July 1920, men from the ship became involved in the unrest in Split. During a violent confrontation with a group of Croats, the ship's captain and a sailor were shot and killed. Puglia was sold for scrapping on 22 March 1923. While the ship was being dismantled, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini donated the ship's bow section to the writer and ardent nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio, who <b>had</b> <b>it</b> installed at his estate as part of the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed <b>had</b> <b>it</b> not been for their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E

5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, <b>had</b> <b>it</b> chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger.

Constantine, still in possession of the box, realizes that the box is allowing evil thoughts to go through everyone's mind, and a massive fight breaks out as the heroes struggle to get possession of the box.|$|E
50|$|Aristotelian Essentialism is {{concerned}} with properties which Marcus defines {{in the context of}} a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> not everything <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> if something <b>has</b> <b>it</b> then <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating e.g. a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. Terence Parsons later formally proved this result.|$|R
