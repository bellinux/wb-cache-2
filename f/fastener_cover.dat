40|$|Proposed {{mechanism}} placed behind panel fastens panel to, or unfastens it from, underlying structure. Electric {{motor and}} gearbox drives bolt to engage or disengage captive floating nut. Used where head at outer end of bolt or other <b>fastener</b> <b>covered</b> with protective outer layer on panel and inner end of bolt inaccessible...|$|R
50|$|The {{structural}} components are, generally, {{the frame}} members, bearings, splines, springs, seals, <b>fasteners</b> and <b>covers.</b> The shape, texture {{and color of}} covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users.|$|R
50|$|With {{exception}} to part 7, which defines test standards, {{the parts of}} this standard define properties for fasteners made of carbon steel and alloy steel. The standards define that the testing must be performed at ambient temperatures, which is defined as between 10 and 35 C. The standards do not <b>cover</b> <b>fasteners</b> that would otherwise apply but require special properties, such as weldability or corrosion resistance.|$|R
40|$|Flexible multi-shock shield {{system and}} method are {{disclosed}} for defending against hypervelocity particles. The flexible multi-shock shield system and method may include {{a number of}} flexible bumpers or shield layers spaced apart {{by one or more}} resilient support layers, all of which may be encapsulated in a protective <b>cover.</b> <b>Fasteners</b> associated with the protective cover allow the flexible multi-shock shield to be secured to the surface of a structure to be protected...|$|R
40|$|Construction Techniques/Wind Resistance. (302. 8) The digital Cuny Archive {{was made}} {{available}} {{in part through}} funding assistance from USAID. This guide presents to designers, builders, government and private building authorities, and building owners and occupants a series of effective methods for improving the resistance of new and existing buildings against high winds. The methods described may be applied to improving {{the construction of new}} buildings as well as to increase the wind resistance of existing buildings. This material offers guidelines for selecting the location and orientation of buildings and the building shapes, for suggesting methods of construction, for recommended building details, and for local production of connectors and <b>fasteners.</b> It <b>covers</b> two common types of construction? masonry and timber?as well as selected details based on local materials such as bamboo and adobe...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} sealing {{method has}} been developed for the exposed metal fastener surfaces of the Solid Rocket Booster vehicle for the Space Shuttle launch system. The method employs properly sized flexible plastic caps filled with catalyzed polysulfide sealant, frozen and stored. At the time of use, the caps and sealant are thawed and positioned on the <b>fasteners.</b> The sealant <b>covers</b> the exposed portion of the fastener and prevents salt water damage. The method is one of high reliability with low installation and inspection costs...|$|R
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{reviews the}} use of particle analysis to assist in preparing for the 4 th Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing mission. During this mission the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) will be repaired. The particle analysis consisted of Finite element mesh creation, Black-body viewfactors generated using I-DEAS TMG Thermal Analysis, Grey-body viewfactors calculated using Markov method, Particle distribution modeled using an iterative Monte Carlo process, (time-consuming); in house software called MASTRAM, Differential analysis performed in Excel, and Visualization provided by Tecplot and I-DEAS. Several tests were performed and are reviewed: Conformal Coat Particle Study, Card Extraction Study, <b>Cover</b> <b>Fastener</b> Removal Particle Generation Study, and E-Graf Vibration Particulate Study. The lessons learned during this analysis are also reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Cover, Water Canteen - The water canteen {{cover is}} {{fabricated}} of nylon cloth and webbing and acrylic pile liner material. The two-flap closure is secured {{by means of}} metal snap fasteners. There is a small pocket {{on the front of}} the cover for carrying water purification tablets. The lid of this small pocket is secured by means of hook and pile <b>fastener</b> tape. The <b>cover</b> attaches to the individual equipment belt by means of two belt-strap keepers with interlocking slides. The water canteen cover is designed to accommodate the Canteen, Water (NSN 8465-00-889-3477). In 1975, the LC-1 designation for the water canteen cover is changed to LC-2 due to some minor design changes. The National Stock Number remains the same.|$|R
40|$|The sonic {{fatigue test}} program {{to verify the}} design of the {{composite}} inboard aileron for the L- 1011 airplane is described. The composite aileron is fabricated from graphite/epoxy minisandwich covers which are attached to graphite/epoxy front spar and ribs, and to an aluminum rear spar with <b>fasteners.</b> The program <b>covers</b> the development of random fatigue data by means of coupon testing and modal studies on a representative section of the composite aileron, culminating in the accelerated sonic fatigue proof test. The composite aileron sustained nonlinear panel vibration during the proof test without failure. Viscous damping coefficients as low as 0. 4 % were measured on the panels. The effects of moisture conditioning and elevated temperature on the random fatigue life of both undamaged and impact damaged coupons were investigated. The combination of impact damage, moisture, and a 180 F temperature could reduce the random fatigue life by 50 %...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 the Izhmash {{factory in}} the city of Izhevsk began {{full-scale}} production of a modernized variant of the AK-74—the AK-74M (M—Russian: Модернизированный; Modernizirovanniy or [...] "modernized") assault rifle that offers more versatility compared to its predecessor. Apart from several minor improvements, such as a lightened bolt and carrier assembly to reduce the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier during firing, the rifle features a new glass-filled polyamide stock that retains the shape of the original AK-74 fixed laminated wood stock, but side-folds to the left like the skeletonized AKS-74 buttstock. Additionally the AK-74M features an improved muzzle device, a reinforced smooth dust cover and a redesigned guide rod return spring retainer that allows firing the GP-25, GP-30 and GP-34 underslung grenade launchers without having to use the previously necessary additional receiver <b>cover</b> <b>fastener.</b> Each AK-74M is fitted with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. The AK-74M would have been adopted by the Soviet Union as the standard service rifle, and has been accepted as the new service rifle of the Russian Federation.|$|R
