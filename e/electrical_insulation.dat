5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60â€“80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment.

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>insulations</b> {{are one of}} {{the basic}} parts of {{electrical}} machinery in any sizes and characteristics. Focusing on insulating, studies on the operation of industrial-electrical machinery came {{to the fact that the}} most important part of a machine is the Stator. This fact reveals the requirement for inspection of the <b>electrical</b> machine <b>insulation</b> along with the electromagnetic tensions. Therefore with respect to insulation system improvement of stator, the HV generator can be optimized. Dielectric parameters such as insulation thickness, spacing, material types, geometry of winding and slot are major design consideration. A very powerful method available to analyze electromagnetic performance is Finite Element Method (FEM) which is used in this paper. The analysis of various stator coil and slot configurations are used to design the better dielectric system to reduce electrical stresses in order to increase the power of generator in the same volume of core. These processes of optimization have been done according the proposed algorithm. In this algorithm the technical constraints have been considered. This paper describes the process used to perform classical design and improvement analysis of stator slotâ€™s insulation with respect to objective function and constraints...|$|R
2500|$|Motors {{have very}} little room for <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> so they {{generally}} have low voltage ratings. Because transformers (prior {{to the development of}} power electronics) cannot step down DC voltages, trains were supplied with a relatively low DC voltage that the motors can use directly. The most common DC voltages are listed in the previous section. Third (and fourth) rail systems almost always use voltages below 1kV for safety reasons while overhead wires usually use higher voltages for efficiency. ("Low" [...] voltage is relative; even 600V can be instantly lethal when touched.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|E
2500|$|Long {{distance}} {{electric power}} transmission results in energy loss, through electrical resistance, heat generation, electromagnetic induction and less-than-perfect <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation.</b> [...] In 1995, these losses were estimated at 7.2%. Energy generation and distribution can be more efficient the closer {{it is to the}} point of use, if conducted in a high-efficiency generator, such as a CHP.

This similarity allows for maximum compatibility, coupled with the outstanding physical properties of polyimides.

A polymer chain end capping group that allows the polymer to crosslink into a nonflowable repair upon curing at around 200 C was also identified...|$|R
2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice coil winding {{is almost always}} copper, with an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E
2500|$|Asbestos mining existed {{more than}} 4,000 years ago, but {{large-scale}} mining {{began at the}} end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties.

It was used in such applications as <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used.
