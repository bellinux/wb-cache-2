5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in {{view of the fact that}} Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then {{virtually}} mean 'at sunrise.' As regarding dǫglings for Dellings in H, and Dǫglingar were the descendants of Dagr (according to SnE. 183).|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E
5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{exception}} to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are {{the elements of the}} scenario rather than people and hair-cutting.

It might be the pass to the south or it might be the pass between the summit itself and the pinnacle, Nåle. Nåle, the Needle, has got its name from the local word for pinnacle, which describes the shape of it.|$|E
25|$|Devotion to the Sacred Heart {{developed}} out of {{the devotion}} to the Holy Wounds, in particular to the Sacred Wound {{in the side of}} Jesus. The first indications of devotion to the Sacred Heart are found in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the fervent atmosphere of the Benedictine or Cistercian monasteries, in the world of Bernardine thought. But it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with certainty what were its first texts or who were its first devotees.|$|E
25|$|One {{weakness}} in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally {{in such a case}} would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{relationships}} listed above {{are likely to}} be instances of inalienable possession, ultimately what is classified as inalienable depends on language- and culture-specific conventions. It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which this holds true. For example, neighbor may be an inalienable noun in one language, but alienable in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in this respect alienability is similar to other types of noun classes, such as grammatical gender.|$|E
25|$|In Transylvania, the Celts {{shifted from}} inhumation to cremation, either through natural {{progression}} {{or because of}} Dacian influence. Almost without exception, the necropoleis so far studied are bi-ritual, although cremation {{appears to be more}} prevalent than inhumation. The Celts in Dacia certainly cremated their dead from the second La Tène period onwards but Celtic inhumations appear no older than pit-grave cremations in any of the cemeteries. It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether the Celts turned away from the practice of cremation as the Scythians had. Although less frequent, inhumation still occurred as a constant practice even during the final stage of Celtic inhabitation of this territory.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E

50|$|There {{is only a}} very loose {{connection}} between the bols and their technique. Sometimes different techniques are used because different musicians represent different gharanas, or musical styles. Sometimes different techniques are used {{in order to get}} a technical advantage (e.g., playing very fast). Sometimes different techniques are used simply because a different artistic statement is being made. For these reasons, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> categorically <b>say</b> that a certain bol will be executed in any one fashion.|$|R
25|$|First, Archie is not {{a friend}} but a paid employee, who acts as secretary, chauffeur, and legman to the mountainous and {{sedentary}} Wolfe. Then they differ in all important respects—age, background, physique, and education. Finally, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> which is the more interesting and admirable of the two. They are complementary in the unheard-of ratio of 50-50. … Archie has talents without which Wolfe would be lost: his remarkable memory, trained physical power, brash American humor, attractiveness to women, and ability to execute the most difficult errand virtually without instructions. Minus Archie, Wolfe would be a feckless recluse puttering in an old house on West 35th Street, New York.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{with any}} {{certainty}} how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over {{the lives of}} many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated bobbin winder, the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed ratio determined by the gear.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} no designs made for this {{elevation}} (Bedford Avenue), but the aim has been to have a central tower on the same axis as that on Flatbush Avenue, through the archway {{in the base of}} which will be afforded a view of the ‘quad’ with its greensward, trees, shrubs and vines. What the ultimate design of the various buildings going to make up the group may be, it is, of course, <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but in designing and planning that portion which you now see approaching completion, I have always intended that the whole should be a graphic illustration of the various phases of the so-called Gothic movement, from the Round Arch to the Flamboyant and on through its later transitional stage.|$|E
