Since its inauguration, in 1979, the AIVC has been running without interruption.On June 9, 2016 the executive committee of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Technical Collaboration Programme Buildings and Communities (EBC TCP), approved a 5-year extension period for the AIVC from 2017 till 2021. In the first years, the AIVC’s primary focus was understanding and finding ways to limit the energy impact of air infiltration in buildings. This was reflected in its original name “Air Infiltration Centre”. Ventilation was introduced in the name in 1986 because of the strong interactions between ventilation and infiltration in buildings and increasing interest in indoor air quality concerns. The Centre has developed an expertise in ventilation and infiltration with a series of technical notes and guides ...|$|E

50|$|The Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDE) {{was formed}} in 1987 and officially ended 30 June 2014. It was {{initiated}} as a multilateral agreement under the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreement network, replacing numerous other bilateral agreements. The multilateral agreement was for the international exchange of energy {{research and development and}} information. The exchange resulted in a database which was the world's largest collection of energy research, technology, and development (RTD) information (ETDEWEB - described below). The collection of information was generated from energy RTD literature published in member countries and through other partnering arrangements with organizations such as the International Nuclear Information System (a unit of the International Atomic Energy Agency). This had the effect of creating a broad spectrum of information that was included in the ETDE database. The range of content included fossil fuels, renewable energies (including Hydrogen), End-Use (Buildings, Industry and Transport), fusion, energy policy, conservation, and efficiency, and cross-sectional activities. This fulfilled the need for timely exchange of global information towards the goal of a sustainable energy future. ETDE operated under an IEA <b>Implementing</b> <b>Agreement</b> and was governed by an Executive Committee of delegates from ETDE member countries. Officers of the Executive Committee included a Chair and two Vice-Chairs, elected to three-year terms. Day-to-day operations were managed through an operating agent organization, which reported to the Executive Committee.|$|E

40|$|The authors study noncooperative {{multilateral}} bargaining games, {{based on}} underlying TU games, in which coalitions can renegotiate their agreements. They distinguish between models in which players continue to bargain after <b>implementing</b> <b>agreements</b> (reversible actions) and models in which players who <b>implement</b> <b>agreements</b> must leave the game (irreversible actions). The authors show that renegotiation always results in {{formation of the}} grand coalition if actions are reversible but that the process may otherwise end with smaller coalitions. On the other hand, they show that the grand coalition cannot form in one step if {{the core of the}} game is empty, irrespective of the reversibility of actions.
