5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact.|$|E

A strong desire for precision and distinctness of ideas; 5. An excessive weakness of memory; 6. A great incapacity of continued attention.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Tony O'Reilly {{decided to}} have the church restored, noting that he had often walked through the church field {{with his father and}} he engendered in me a great curiosity for the strange mosaic of Irish and Anglo Irish history and a {{compelling}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about Castlemartin and the small Chapel that was a place of worship before the Reformation and had viewed silently the march and counter march of Irish history.|$|E

25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien {{had a great deal}} of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O'Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to think he did. Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E

William Coddington rose, asserting, [...] "I do not see any clear witness against her, {{and you know it}} is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," [...] ending with, [...] "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke, and {{therefore}} deserve no censure." [...] The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. [...] Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. [...] Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. [...] Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, [...] "I <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> wherefore I am banished." [...] Winthrop responded, [...] "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied." ...|$|E

CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what was going to happen}} combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted."

500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E

When she asked Murasaki for lessons in Chinese, she insisted they be conducted in secret. Murasaki explained that [...] "because [...] evinced a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about such things, to keep it secret we carefully chose times when the other women would not be present, and, from the summer before last I started given her informal lessons on the two volumes of 'New Ballads'.

She claimed that Snape is the only protagonist who genuinely has a choice to make and who struggles {{to do the right}} thing, hence the only one to face a [...] "compelling inner crisis". She believed the popularity of the character is due to the moral journey and inner conflict that Snape undergoes within the series, as it is the hero's struggle and costly redemption that really matter: [...] " [...] character ached for resolution. And it is precisely this need for resolution—our <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the real Snape and to understand his choices—that makes him the most compelling character in the Potter epic." ...|$|E

He told his first audience, [...] "I <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> no party, no section, no North, no South, no East, no West; nothing but Kansas and my county." [...] Geary disbanded the existing Kansas militia, organized a new state militia, and relied heavily on federal troops to help keep order. On October 17, he started a twenty-day tour of the territory and spoke to groups everywhere he stopped to gain their opinions.|$|E
