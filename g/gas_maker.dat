40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the value}} and cost of line-pack flexibility in liberalized gas markets through {{the examination of the}} techno-economic characteristics of gas transport pipelines and the trade-offs between the different ways to use the infrastructure: transport and flexibility. Line-pack flexibility is becoming increasingly important as a tool to balance gas supply and demand over different periods. In the European liberalized market context, a monopolist unbundled network operator offers regulated transport services and flexibility (balancing) services according to the network code and the balancing rules. Therefore, <b>gas</b> policy <b>makers</b> should understand the role and consequences of line-pack regulation. The analysis shows that the line-pack flexibility service has an important economic value for the shippers and the TSO. Furthermore, the analysis identifies distorting effects in the gas market due to inadequate regulation of line-pack flexibility: by disregarding the fixed cost of the flexibility in the balancing rules, the overall efficiency of the gas system is decreased.

Finally, the analysis demonstrates that the actual costs of line-pack flexibility are related to the peak cumulative imbalance throughout the balancing period. Any price for pipeline flexibility should, therefore, be based on the related trade-off between the right to use the line-pack flexibility and the provision of transport services.

40|$|Instead of {{efficiently}} pricing greenhouse <b>gases,</b> policy <b>makers</b> have favored {{measures that}} implicitly or explicitly subsidize low carbon fuels. We simulate a transportation-sector cap & trade program (CAT) and three policies currently in use: ethanol subsidies, a renewable fuel standard (RFS), {{and a low}} carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Our simulations confirm that the alternatives to CAT are quite costly— 2. 5 to 4 times more expensive. We provide evidence that the persistence of these alternatives {{in spite of their}} higher costs lies in the political economy of carbon policy. The alternatives to CAT exhibit a feature that make them amenable to adoption|a right skewed distribution of gains and losses where many counties have small losses, but a smaller share of counties gain considerably—as much as $ 6, 800 per capita, per year. We correlate our estimates of gains from CAT and the RFS with Congressional voting on the Waxman-Markey cap & trade bill, H. R. 2454. Because Waxman-Markey (WM) would weaken the RFS, House members likely viewed the two policies as competitors. Conditional on a district's CAT gains, increases in a district's RFS gains are associated with decreases in the likelihood of voting for WM. Furthermore, we show that campaign contributions are correlated with a district's gains under each policy and that these contributions are correlated with a Member's vote on WM. ...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of trying to reduce climate change {{involves}} weighing alternatives and then setting priorities. For example, you could plant trees to store carbon, but that might {{reduce the amount of}} food you can grow on the same land. Or you could add fertilizers to boost food production, but that might need more energy and could increase emissions of greenhouse <b>gases</b> (GHGs). Decision <b>makers</b> planning for climate change need to steer an optimal course that balances reducing emissions with sustaining future food production and protecting environmental health. Yet the information needed to plot that course is usually unavailable, especially in low-income countries, because models require huge amounts of data and hours of computer time. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) is working to make information about the impacts of various mitigation measures available, so that policy makers can reach better-informed decisions...|$|R
40|$|Production {{of oil and}} gas in Indonesia {{has fallen}} {{steadily}} during the last decade, owing to a combination of reduced exploration efforts and natural decline in currently producing fields. To counter-balance declining reserves in mature oil fields and a lack of expansion of known natural <b>gas</b> reserves, policy <b>makers</b> are now pursuing exploration initiatives more energetically. However, producers have expressed deep concern about the prospects for fair cost-recovery rules, and about the legal and regulatory environment more generally. Three issues are particularly relevant to the investment climate: resource nationalism; the anti-corruption drive; and decentralisation. Steps that the government could take include stemming the erosion of fiscal terms in contracts and ensuring contract sanctity. And although economic nationalists will find it hard to accept, maximising the benefits to the Indonesian people of exploiting the nation's hydrocarbon resources will require the presence of the world's most efficient operators. ...|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{non-energy}} use {{of fossil fuels}} in energy statistics are subject to major uncertainties. We apply a simple bottom-up methodology to recalculate {{non-energy use}} for the entire world and for the 50 countries with the highest consumption of fossil fuels for non-energy purposes. We quantify worldwide non-energy use in the year 2000 to be 24 ± 2 exajoules (EJ), thereby accounting for 6 % of the global total primary energy supply (TPES). Our bottom-up estimates {{are in line with}} data from international energy statistics for the entire world and for 14 individual countries. Our estimates exceed official non-energy use data for 22 countries, whereas they are lower than official data in the case of 14 countries. Inconsistent system boundaries of non-energy use data in international energy statistics can explain parts of the observed deviations. We regard our bottom-up methodology as reliable albeit being attached with uncertainties. We recommend its use for energy statisticians and greenhouse <b>gas</b> (GHG) inventory <b>makers</b> to generate a shortlist of countries, for which efforts should be made to clarify and improve the quality of non-energy use data in national and international energy statistics...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} (EE) {{programs are}} generally considered an effective policy for controlling electricity demand growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and for lowering {{the cost of}} electric power for individuals and society. Evaluating these programs is difficult, {{and the results of}} such evaluations have proven controversial. Nevertheless, to abate energy consumption and greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions, policy <b>makers</b> have continued to view EE as the most cost effective policy option available. The governmental sector plays an important and central role in the promotion and development of EE programs, with the ability to regulate, promote, analyze, and fund such programs. This paper attempts to quantify the effectiveness of governmental actions in EE activities through the use of econometric modeling of the Canadian provinces from the period of 1999 to 2005. For the last six years, the Canadian Centre for Energy Efficiency (CCEE) has graded the Canadian provinces on their EE activities. This study uses these grades as a measurement for provincial governmental EE efforts. Through a panel level statistical analysis using electricity consumption, the grades, and various controls over several years, this study attempts to find a correlation between the change in provincial grade and the change in energy consumption. A negative correlation between the two suggests that increased provincial government effort in EE programs reduces electricity consumption. The results of this study point to such a correlation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Functional Rehabilitation and Reeducation Centre (CRRF) in Noth in the {{department}} of Creuse in France is seeking permanent home automation solutions that help patients to safely have more autonomy in everyday life. An experimental apartment consisting of a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen was equipped with communicating devices and remote controls. The aim is to validate the possibility of returning home a patient who have stayed at the medical centre and have motor and cognitive disabilities. A Konnex EIB/KNX bus is used to interface all the sensors and actuators. In the bedroom, an environment controller allows to control objects often inaccessible to the patient because of his disability. Ambient and reading light, shutters, heating, nurse call and television are actuated by conventional switches which have been increased and relayed by the controller. Different functions of the bed can be remotely controlled such as the folding legs, the inclination of the headrest and the height of the bed. A contrast of the switches has been adapted for better visibility. Easily understandable pictograms have been added for an intuitive use. The bedroom door is managed through push up buttons that can be switched with the elbow for a person in a wheelchair. In the bathroom, occupancy sensors have been installed to adjust lighting for better use of toilets facilities. Counting of water associated with flood detection prevents and detects potential overflow of sanitary and bath. In the kitchen, the height of work plans and mobile furniture is adjustable by hand or knee to facilitate access for people with motor disabilities, with safety contacts in case of obstacles. Scenarios have been defined with ergo therapists to prevent the patient against electrical, gas and water dangers in the apartment. These scenarios are managed by a controller that determines the type and degree of danger: the high level (gas, iron, fire risk) and the low level for events that do not require immediate action (oven, electric hob, <b>gas</b> hob, coffee <b>maker</b> and microwave oven). The supervision software used enables the complete management of all alarms and commands transiting through the communication bus via a MODBUS TCP interface. Doctors and therapists will be able to follow the daily activities in the apartment to assess the ability of residents to return home. The system also targets the requirements of housing adjustment aimed at dependent persons returning to their homes...|$|R
