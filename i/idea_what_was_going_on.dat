500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I {{glanced out the}} {{porthole}} as the bow swung past the line of sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our starboard quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now and I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 1971, NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado {{was ready}} to {{broadcast}} a normal required weekly test of the Emergency Broadcast System. However, AT reported that the United States Air Force used the wrong tape for the test by accident, and initiated an Emergency Action Notification, normally issued by the Office of Civil Defense or the President. This prompted all stations in the Fort Wayne, Indiana, area by order of the FCC to operate under emergency procedures and feed the broadcast from WOWO through their radios. Bob Sievers was at the microphone at WOWO at the time, and he, along with everyone at the studio, had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, a {{scientist}} already has an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, a hypothesis, and {{he or she}} performs an expression profiling experiment with the idea of potentially disproving this hypothesis. In other words, the scientist is making a specific prediction about levels of expression that {{could turn out to be}} false.|$|R
2500|$|Steele {{never saw}} a {{complete}} screenplay for the film. Instead, she was simply handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production. According to Steele, [...] "We were given the pages day to day. We had hardly any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down on that film. We {{had no idea of}} the end, or the beginning, either, not at all." ...|$|R
50|$|Siegfried (Siggi) Schwäbli is a {{character}} who first appeared in 1990 in some episodes of Total Normal. Slow-witted, short-sighted and with glasses made of plastic blocks, Siggi constantly puts his foot in it and often has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. At the Cannstatter Volksfest festival in Stuttgart, for example, {{he went on the}} ghost train with Barbara Schöneberger, a TV host, and almost passed out with fear.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Dench {{appeared}} as Aereon, an ambassador of the Elemental race who helps uncover the mysterious past of Richard B. Riddick, played by Vin Diesel, in David Twohy's science fiction sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. Selected by Diesel, who prompted writers {{to re-create the}} character to fit a female persona {{because he wanted to}} work with the actress, she called filming [...] "tremendous fun", although she [...] "had absolutely no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the plot." [...] The film was a critical and box office failure. In his review of the film, James Berardinelli from ReelViews remarked that he felt that Dench's character served no more [...] "useful purpose than to give [...] an opportunity to appear in a science fiction movie." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{was to have}} {{a devastating}} effect on club {{membership}} and many members had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> or which club they actually belonged to.|$|E
5000|$|Robert and Carol {{have been}} going out {{together}} in New York. They return from a play, where they both confess they had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Carol invites Robert up to her apartment for coffee, and Robert is unable to, because he is [...] "still married".|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the rest}} of the cartoon depicts Daffy and Porky {{confusing}} Granny with the actual suspect (because of their identical clothing), and bungling said attempts to capture the crook. An annoyed Granny, who has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, mistakes the inept policemen for mischievous trick-or-treaters, while the robber (who is hiding out in a vacant apartment in the same building Granny is living) also foils every attempt by Daffy and Porky.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the show's first season, it is {{revealed}} that Bartlet has multiple sclerosis. According to Sorkin, this was not planned; the plot came about because he wanted to write an episode in which the president was in bed watching a soap opera and the audience discovered that the first lady was a physician. [...] "When I wrote the pilot, I didn't have any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen in Episode 2, much less 12," [...] he says.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the driving}} team was unyoked--he {{could hear it}} being led away--but the ache in his head grew almost {{intolerable}} and his lassitude more intense. For a while he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on; and then a hoarse cry, which seemed one of alarm, rang out sharply. There was a patter of running feet, a thud of hoofs on the soft soil, and, breaking through these sounds, a rhythmic staccato drumming. Somebody was riding hard across the uneven ground.|$|R
5000|$|... "And {{he said it}} so smooth, so fast," [...] recalls Searles. [...] "We {{just kind}} of smiled and {{had no idea what}} he was saying. We were rookies. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> But every {{briefcase}} zipped up and closed and everyone sat up straight in their chairs. It was over.|$|E
5000|$|At {{first she}} {{represented}} Westerners and other non-Afghans stranded in Afghan prisons. [...] "What I found," [...] she later recalled, [...] "is that most {{did not have}} proper legal representation. If they were English-speaking, they had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in court. I felt and still feel a great responsibility for them {{as a person and}} as a lawyer." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{took part}} in the infamous 1.4 Incident, which {{occurred}} on January fourth, 1999 at the Tokyo Dome, where UFO member Naoya Ogawa faced Shinya Hashimoto in a pro wrestling match. Gordeau was in Ogawa's corner along with Kazunari Murakami and Tiger Mask, and when Naoya turned the bout into a shoot by brutally striking Hashimoto, who had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> Gerard and his colleagues had to protect Ogawa from the NJPW crew in the subsequent brawl.|$|E
5000|$|So the {{daughter}} {{sat on the}} tree and the demons came as expected. They took her home {{and told her to}} prepare flatbreads while they went to wash up. When the mouse came repeatedly asking for a flatbread, she became irritated and touched it with a red hot shovel, sending it running back into its hole. Since the mouse didn't tell her anything, she had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. The demons returned and the three ate flatbreads and went to bed, with the girl sleeping in the middle.|$|R

5000|$|The {{songs from}} the album were {{inspired}} by the long tour that came {{after the release of}} Alessi's Ark's debut album, Notes from the Treehouse, with Laurent-Marke explaining [...] "this is a collection of songs that have mostly grown from travelling and touring, away from the familiarity of home, family and friends". The album title came from the long hours of recording every day: [...] "In Brighton, we did 12 hour days and had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the outside world. In Wales, there was no phone signal, and it felt far away from everything." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even {{though many}} people thought that the scowling woman in the opening {{sequence}} was grumpy-looking, she actually had just been concerned for Mary's safety. In 2002, on Good Morning America, Mary said, [...] "It was so cold, I couldn't protest. The words weren't forming," [...] she said. [...] "So I did as I was told, and dear Hazel Frederick, who was frozen forever in the background, looking with {{what appears to be}} a scowling face at me, and she told me later, because I did meet her, that it was just that she had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> never saw a camera. She just thought there was a lunatic about to lose her life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Snyder {{also sought}} to {{cultivate}} a wider sense of mission. He brought ground troops aboard the New Jersey for weekend liberty, earning the ship the nickname [...] "The New Jersey Hilton." [...] Told to stop the [...] "unauthorized public relations stunt" [...] by DoD, Snyder sternly responded, noting that he had notified the Pentagon, {{and that it was}} no stunt. Instead, it was meant to give the ground troops a respite from the war, and remind his men why they were providing gunfire support. He finished his message by disparaging the Pentagon as [...] "Disneyland East," [...] and stating that he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> there, but couldn't care less.|$|E
6000|$|Number 6, however, was an {{exception}} to former passions--Francis Bell was the most faithful of lovers. When his time arrived to go to college, and it became necessary to acquaint Mr. Coacher of the arrangements that had been made, the latter cried, [...] "God bless my soul, I hadn't the least <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on;" [...] as was indeed very likely, for he had been taken in three times before in precisely a similar manner; and Francis went to the University resolved to conquer honours, {{so as to be}} able to lay them at the feet of his beloved Martha.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 23, 2011 on iTunes. It was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick who is famous for directing music videos {{for the likes of}} Britney Spears, Oasis and Nickelback and shot in Malibu on May 7, 2011. The plot of the video revolves around Cook’s visit to the beach to write a few songs and get over the loss of his girl. He then arrives at a beach and after paying the taxi driver, he drops his wallet. After writing some songs, he takes off his jacket and starts walking along the beach. A woman walks by and sees his belongings and footsteps that led out to the sea. Fearing that Cook had drowned, she calls the police and explains everything. Meanwhile, Cook returns to his room solving a crossword puzzle and playing the guitar and has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. A police border was made around the beach and some of Cook's band members tells their band mate Neal Tiemann about the news which was printed {{on the front page of}} the newspaper bearing the caption 'David Cook, Feared Drowned'. They then watch the news where the news caption says 'Singer left note'. Cook who has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, then leaves his room and sees his band members outside looking sad. Oblivious to his presence, he asks them [...] "What are you looking at?". Then his drummer faints.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose we go {{down-stream}} a short way and lie in {{wait for}} them," [...] said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> forward.|$|R

5000|$|Beatallica toured Germany in December 2009 {{supporting}} JBO {{who were}} celebrating their 20th anniversary. During the tour Jaymz would join J.B.O on stage to sing [...] "Ein Guter Tag Zum Sterben" [...] in German. On the final {{night of the}} tour in Berlin, J.B.O. (mainly Vito C.) hijacked Beatallica's set by playing AC/DC's song [...] "Highway to Hell" [...] on guitar from backstage. Beatallica had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and thought a CD somehow was being played in error from the soundboard. During J.B.O.'s final set, Beatallica came out on stage wearing J.B.O.'s pink robes, which they stole from their dressing room, and took over the stage dancing around and drinking. Jaymz used a 'Beatallica Arschwaschlappen' to wipe Hannes Holzmann face much to the laughter of the sold out audience.|$|E

I entered, and the door was closed behind me. I {{followed}} this man through a stone passageway, and {{he took me to}} a little stone room. ''Wait here!' he said, and he shut me in. I was in pitch-darkness, and had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen next. After a little time I saw a streak of light coming through a keyhole; then an inner door opened, and a young woman with a lamp came into the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} washed your hands of Merwell, Nat," [...] replied Dave, with warmth. [...] "He {{is not the}} sort for any respectable fellow to {{associate}} with. But about that letter. Have you any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I was in shock. From your {{training}} in seeing so many movies and reading books, {{you know your}} hero <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> saved … Someone has something planned, because they’re {{not really going to}} chop off his head — right up until the moment when they chopped off his head. I was shocked, and then admiring of George’s ruthlessness. It’s a tough thing to build up a character and make somebody as memorable and impressive as Ned and then get rid of him. But {{at the same time it}} leads to a story that is so much more suspenseful because you truly have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen and who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to survive.|$|R
5000|$|Neive later {{arranged}} {{an industry}} launch {{night in the}} city for Phoebe. However, Phoebe was [...] "blissfully" [...] unaware that Neive was planning something more sinister for her, as she was focused on her potential music career. While Phoebe was preparing for her set, Neive's assistant, Grant Barnes (Adam Gray) asked her if she wanted Phoebe to perform, and when Neive said no, he spiked Phoebe's drink. Neive then insisted that Phoebe drank the champagne, which left her incapacitated and with no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Grant then tried to undress and assault Phoebe while they were being filmed. Phoebe was rescued by Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) and Martin Ashford (George Mason), but Grant told Neive that they had enough footage to post online. Giovinazzo summed up Phoebe's short-lived music career: [...] "Phoebe lives and breathes music and believes it can change the world. She was then introduced to the media-inclined industry, fought for what she believed in, but was ultimately pulled into the machine." [...] Giovinazzo enjoyed the storyline, calling it a [...] "wonderful journey to play".|$|E

Some of the month's {{highlights}} include: Count Vertigo #1, Deadshot #1, Black Manta #1, The Riddler #1, Arcane #1, Cheetah #1, Man-Bat #1 and Parasite #1. Conversely, Joker's Daughter #1 was universally criticized, with IGN saying [...] "It does almost nothing to justify its existence. The story is less than engaging and the main character is probably the least interesting villain of all time. Joker's Daughter is a mess {{from start to finish}} and certainly not a comic that can be recommended to fans of Batman or the Joker. This is rock bottom for [...] "Villains Month", no doubt." [...] Newsarama stated that the issue [...] "bounces all over the place and never once finds any kind of voice, for character or story" [...] and reviewer Aaron Duran had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources added, [...] "this is a comic that you shouldn't be rushing to the store in order to snag a copy" [...] and [...] "within six months, most readers will be trying to forget all about the new Joker's Daughter." ...|$|E

Dona Flor accepts his proposal. While her new husband lacks the passionate sensuality of Vadinho, he {{compensates}} by providing a life free of worry. But, on {{the first anniversary of}} her marriage, Vadinho returns. He is now a ghost, but has lost none of his old ways. His activities create commotion everywhere, from Dona Flor’s marriage bed to the local nightspots.

The next night, he beats Johnny up and tells him to stay away from Mona. When Mona hears that Johnny has called in [...] "sick", she goes to visit him at home and learns at the last moment that he is married with a young son.

And it was no good at all, Bruno said, to do a 'Bit' of Shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it (you see he didn't count me as anybody). So he set to work with a stick, stirring them up, very much as you would stir up tea in a cup, till most of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage.|$|R
