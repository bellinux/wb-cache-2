They argued that this particular industry could be characterized as having a high-velocity environment, because it exhibited rapid and discontinuous change in demand, competition, technology and regulations. In a number of subsequent studies, it has been determined that success in high-velocity environments is related to fast, formal strategic decision-making processes {{and the use of}} <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasoning</b> processes.|$|E

Familiar situations are processed in a system involving the frontal and temporal lobes whereas unfamiliar situations are processed in the frontal and parietal lobes. These two similar but dissociated processes provide a biological explanation for the differences between <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasoning</b> and formal logic.|$|E

We tested a set of tasks and assessments to determine whether subjects used the <b>heuristics</b> in <b>reasoning,</b> to obtain initial frequencies of heuristic use and related cognitive errors, and to collect cognitive process data using think-aloud techniques. The study investigates two aspects of the Representativeness heuristic - judging by perceived frequency and representativeness as causal beliefs. Results show that subjects apply both aspects of the <b>heuristic</b> during <b>reasoning,</b> and make errors related to misapplication of these heuristics. Subjects in this study rarely used base rates, showed significant variability in their recall of base rates, demonstrated limited ability to use provided base rates, and favored causal data in diagnosis.

40|$|An expert {{epistemology}} is {{a theory}} about knowledge in the expertise and includes knowledge representation, semantics, specifications, <b>heuristics,</b> <b>reasoning,</b> etc. Superexpert systems employ computer capabilities to extend ordinary human abilities, and are derived from expert epistemologies. A superexpert system, Negotiation Game or NeGame (NeG), is designed to support the Harvard Principled Negotiation model; it is illustrated by a Civilisation application which reframes the Israel-Palestine conflict as the task of negotiating a mutually acceptable civilisation. The negotiation epistemology of NeG evolved from the adversarial epistemology of eGanges (eG); both handle tasks in a user-friendly and transparent way. NeG manages hierarchical complexity of the conflict issues and differences in their subjective values, advises on cumulative scoring of Wins and Losses, and, through mathematical techniques, maximises Win-Win options. Adversarial epistemology requires four-valued logic, whereas negotiation epistemology requires six-valued logic; they share a common knowledge hierarchy, called a River. ...|$|R

40|$|Histograms {{are widely}} used, but {{recent studies have}} shown that they are not as easy to {{interpret}} as it might seem. In this article, we report on three studies on the interpretation of histograms in which we investigated, namely, (1) whether the misinterpretation by university students can be considered {{to be the result of}} <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasoning,</b> (2) whether we could influence performance by stimulating or hindering the analytic processing of histograms, and (3) whether experts still show signs of this heuristic misinterpretation. We found that both university students and experts show signs of incorrect <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasoning</b> when comparing the mean of two data sets presented by histograms. Stimulating or hindering analytic processing did not affect performance. These indications of <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasoning</b> and the impossibility to affect this analytic processing suggest that the incorrect heuristic misinterpretation of histograms is very persistent.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} dynamic decision making by exploring how people understand the dynamic system underlying a task with modest dynamic complexity. Using the faculty gender balancing task, we experimentally test the extent to which participants correctly estimate the inflow needed to balance two unbalanced stocks and how they substantiate their decision. The results, based on performance data for 133 participants, show that people have difficulty determining the correct hiring percentage. Three-quarters of the participants recommended a hiring percentage that was too low to balance the stocks in time or to balance them at all. Analysis of the substantiations showed that nearly half of the participants underpinned their decision with calculations, while 45 percent used intuitive estimations. The calculations seem to be based on three <b>heuristics,</b> <b>reasoning</b> patterns on which participants erroneously relied to assess dynamic behavior.

40|$|This thesis will {{be focused}} on the {{classical}} capacity of quantum channels, one of the first areas treated by quantum information theorists. The problem is fairly solved since some years. Nevertheless, this work will give me a reason to introduce a consistent formalism of the quantum theory, as well as to review fundamental facts about quantum non-locality and how {{it can be used to}} enhance communication. Moreover, this reflects my dwelling in the spirit of classical information theory, and it is intended to be a starting point towards a thorough study of how quantum technologies can help to shape the future of telecommunications. Whenever it was possible, <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasonings</b> were introduced instead of rigorous mathematical proofs. This finds an explanation in that I am a self-taught neophyte in the field, and just about every time I came across a new concept, physical arguments were always more compelling to me than just maths. The technical content of the thesis is twofold. On one hand, a quadratic classification based on optimization programs that I devised for distinguishing entangled states is presented in Chapter 4.

40|$|We study {{nonuniform}} sampling in shift-invariant {{spaces and}} the construction of Gabor frames with respect to the class of totally positive functions whose Fourier transform factors as ĝ(ξ) = ∏_j= 1 ^n (1 + 2 π iδ_jξ) ^- 1 e^-c ξ^ 2 for δ_ 1, [...] .,δ_n∈R, c > 0 (in which case g is called totally positive of Gaussian type). In analogy to Beurling's sampling theorem for the Paley-Wiener space of entire functions, we prove that every separated set with lower Beurling density > 1 is a sampling set for the shift-invariant space generated by such a g. In view of the known necessary density conditions, this result is optimal and validates the <b>heuristic</b> <b>reasonings</b> in the engineering literature. Using a subtle connection between sampling in shift-invariant spaces and the theory of Gabor frames, we show that the set of phase-space shifts of g with respect to a rectangular lattice αZ×βZ forms a frame, if and only if αβ < 1. This solves an open problem going back to Daubechies in 1990 for the class of totally positive functions of Gaussian type. The proof strategy involves the connection between sampling in shift-invariant spaces and Gabor frames, a new characterization of sampling sets "without inequalities" in the style of Beurling, new properties of totally positive functions, and the interplay between zero sets of functions in a shift-invariant space and functions in the Bargmann-Fock space.
