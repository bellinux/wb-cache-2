500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Sonia Saraiya {{felt that}} The Million Second Quiz, in {{contrast}} to other major reality shows such as Big Brother, was a [...] "hyped show about hype" [...] that was [...] "so deeply flawed and so universally unpopular {{that it is not}} going to remain in anyone's memory for long. ... In this wildly expensive failure, it’s possible to see so many of NBC's flaws, all in the same package." [...] However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "relatable," [...] rather than [...] "chosen for their reprehensibility." [...] Digital Spys Catriona Wightman doubted the series would be able to retain viewership: [...] "Even while I sort of enjoyed the first episode despite myself, I can't imagine becoming obsessed with it to that extent - <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> enough there to sustain that kind of interest?" ...|$|E

Enough that I have found it out--and the finding has caused that trouble and anxiety which made me so {{inaccessible}} to you all through to-day. Now, to refresh my memory about your affairs--it is some time since I talked them over with you. The money has been raised, in the absence of your wife's signature, by means of bills at three months--raised at a cost that makes my poverty-stricken foreign hair stand on end to think of it!

60|$|What is {{the secret}} of the {{attraction}} that there is for me in this man? Does it only mean that I feel the contrast between the frankly kind manner in which he has allowed me to become acquainted with him, and the merciless dislike and distrust with which I am met by other people? Or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> something in him which answers to the yearning that I have for a little human sympathy--the yearning, which has survived the solitude and persecution of many years; which seems to grow keener and keener, as the time comes nearer and nearer when I shall endure and feel no more? How useless to ask these questions! Mr. Blake has given me a new interest in life. Let that be enough, without seeking to know what the new interest is.|$|E

Without attempting to intrude myself into your confidence, may I inquire whether Mr. Noel Vanstone has consented to do you justice? I greatly fear he has declined--in which case I can lay my hand on my heart, and solemnly declare that his meanness revolts me. Why do I feel a foreboding that you have appealed to him in vain? Why do I find myself viewing this fellow {{in the light of}} a noxious insect? We are total strangers to each other; I have no sort of knowledge of him, except the knowledge I picked up in making your inquiries. Has my intense sympathy with your interests made my perceptions prophetic? or, to put it fancifully, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> {{such a thing as a}} former state of existence? and has Mr. Noel Vanstone mortally insulted me--say, in some other planet? ...|$|E

40|$|There {{exists a}} {{widespread}} conviction that pension protection, {{along with many}} other social benefits, is slowly being eroded as responsibility for insurance and the associated costs are shifted steadily from government and employers to individual citizens and their family members. But <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> a ‘golden age’ of pension protection? If so, what are the causes that undermined these guarantees, and what are the policy parameters and defining characteristics that have shaped pension policies during the last couple of decades?

6000|$|<b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> such a {{place as}} Hong-Kong? People say so, but I have not yet seen it. Once indeed the clouds lifted and I saw a granite house perched like a cherub on nothing, a {{thousand}} feet above the town. It {{looked as if it}} might {{be the beginning of a}} civil station, but a man came up the street and said, [...] "See this fog It will be like this till September. You'd better go away." [...] I shall not go. I shall encamp in front of the place until the fog lifts and the rain ceases. At present, and it is the third day of April, I am sitting in front of a large coal fire and thinking of the [...] "frosty Caucasus"--you poor creatures in torment afar. And you think as you go to office and orderly-room that you are helping forward England's mission in the East. 'Tis a pretty delusion, and I am sorry to destroy it, but you have conquered the wrong country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! The {{influence}} {{that you have}} had over me has been from first to last an influence for good. Allowing that I have done wrong (in my position) to love you, and, worse even than that, to own it, still the love has been innocent, and the effort to control {{it has been an}} honest effort at least. But, apart from this, my heart tells me that I am the better for the sympathy which has united us. I may confess to you what I have never yet acknowledged--now that we are so widely parted, and so little likely to meet again--whenever I have given myself up unrestrainedly to my own better impulses, they have always seemed to lead me to you. Whenever my mind has been most truly at peace, and I have been able to pray with a pure and a penitent heart, I have felt as if there was some unseen tie that was drawing us nearer and nearer together. And, strange to say, this has always happened (just as my dreams of you have always come to me) when I have been separated from Van Brandt. At such times, thinking or dreaming, it has always appeared to me that I knew you far more familiarly than I know you when we meet face to face. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> such a thing, I wonder, as a former state of existence? And were we once constant companions in some other sphere, thousands of years since? These are idle guesses. Let it be enough for me to remember that I have been the better for knowing you--without inquiring how or why.|$|E
60|$|Am I then, thought I, indeed, {{the hero}} of the haunted room? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> a spell laid upon me, or is this all some {{contrivance}} of mine host, to raise a laugh at my expense? The idea of being hag-ridden by my own fancy all night, and then bantered on my haggard looks the next day was intolerable; but the very idea was sufficient to produce the effect, and to render me still more nervous. Pish, said I, it can be no such thing. How could my worthy host imagine that I, or any man would be so worried by a mere picture? It is my own diseased imagination that torments me. I turned in my bed, and shifted from side to side, to try to fall asleep; but all in vain. When one cannot get asleep by lying quiet, it is seldom that tossing about will effect the purpose. The fire gradually went out and left the room in darkness. Still I had the idea of this inexplicable countenance gazing and keeping watch upon me through the darkness. Nay, what was worse, the very darkness seemed to give it additional power, and to multiply its terrors. It was like having an unseen enemy hovering about one in the night. Instead of having one picture now to worry me, I had a hundred. I fancied it in every direction. And there it is, thought I,--and there, and there,--with its horrible and mysterious expression, still gazing and gazing on me. No if I must suffer this strange and dismal influence, it were better face a single foe, than thus be haunted by a thousand images of it.|$|E

40|$|Best Practices {{is a term}} {{dating back}} to the 1980 s that was popularized by {{business}} writers, most notably Tom Peters and Robert Waterman in their bestseller In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America 2 ̆ 7 s Best Run Companies (1982). Essentially, this term implies success; that certain actions, attitudes, and programs are the most efficient and effective way of doing business and that the same measures can be used with successful outcomes in all similar organizations. But <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> best practices that can help enhance public relations for every type of law library? I believe that <b>there</b> <b>are...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> much {{high profile}} concern over {{apparent}} tensions between sustainability and precaution {{on the one}} hand, and `competitive innovation and `technological progress on the other. How can we balance risk with opportunity and public engagement with `sound science? The outcomes of such debates may undoubtedly be serious for particular technologies, but <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> grounds for concern over the implications for innovation in general? This paper argues that such anxieties often stem from impoverished understandings and strategic misrepresentations of the real nature of scientific creativity and technological possibilities. This can obscure possibilities for achieving more truly sustainable and socially deliberate technological futures...|$|R
