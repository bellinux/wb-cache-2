5000|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> (Ammocrypta pellucida) is a {{fish species}} of the Percidae family. The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> is a {{relatively}} small perch, most plentiful in the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, as well as Lakes Champlain, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario. It prefers sandy-bottomed streams and sandy shoals in the lakes. The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> feeds on larvae of black flies and other small insects in the water. They also feed on zooplankton in small portions due to their small mouth size limiting their gape ability. [...] Their average body size is around 1.5-2 in long and it breeds {{in the spring and}} summer in sandy-bottomed waters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> can {{be found}} in many areas {{throughout}} the United States and into southern Canada. In addition to the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, it {{can be found}} in great concentration in Lake Champlain, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Ontario. They can also be found in the St. Lawrence River drainage in Canada along with the Lake Champlain drainage in Vermont south into New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. Currently, the greatest concentration occurs in northern Alabama and eastern Tennessee. Distribution has slowly decreased over the last few decades and two key factors could be the cause. The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> requires clean sand substrates; hence, siltation is a major factor in their decline. Siltation decreases the quality of habitat for both egg development and adult darters by decreasing the oxygen levels within the sand in which they bury themselves. Furthermore, silted habitats can cause adult darters to not fully burrow or decrease their time burrowed which then causes them to waste energy reserves. Channel or water flow alterations, nutrient enrichment, or any other habitat modification can completely change the amount and quality of the shifting sand bars which can then turn detrimental for the <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter.</b> The increased construction of dams also has been a major factor contributing to the reduction of their habitats. Dams reduce river levels and flow, decrease oxygen levels in reservoir waters, and alter water temperatures, making it difficult for the <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> to reproduce at a comfortable temperature. [...] Dam construction adds a whole new dimension to decreasing the reproduction and survival rate for A. pellucida.|$|E
50|$|Hay Swamp is {{situated}} at the northern limit of the Carolinian Biotic Province and is categorized as consisting of 98% swamp and 2% marshland. Apart from the Ausable and the Black, its primary source of water {{is considered to be}} the local Wyoming Moraine aquifer. Hay Swamp is an important regional habitat for wildlife populations including white-tailed deer, great blue heron, ducks, geese, as well as a significant beaver presence. The swamp is also home to several plant species at risk, including green dragon and Riddell's goldenrod. Endangered fish and mussel species present in Hay Swamp include, <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter,</b> greenside darter, northern riffleshell, snuffbox, wavy-rayed lampmussel, rainbow mussel and kidneyshell.|$|E

50|$|The crystal darter burrows {{in sandy}} {{substrates}} with only its eyes protruding. This behavior may {{have evolved to}} capture prey, avoid predators, or conserve energy. In 1989, Robert Daniels conducted a study on a closely related species, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter,</b> Ammocrypta pellucida, to explain burying behavior, but rejected both the prey avoidance and prey capturing hypotheses. He suggested that darters burrow {{in order to save}} energy while maintaining their position in the sandy substrate where they live. This behavior may be very important during periods of high or low flow, but can be exhibited at any time. Results from Daniels' study may also explain burying behavior in the crystal darter.|$|E
5000|$|The average {{lifespan}} for the <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> {{is about}} 2-3 years, {{but if the}} siltation and pollution continue to worsen, the lifespan will gradually decrease. A. pellucida reproduces in the sandy shoals {{at the bottom of}} the lakes and rivers it inhabits during the spring and summer when the water is at its warmest temperature. It reaches sexual maturity around age one and the males are able to mate once during the breeding season, while females mate twice, producing about 350 eggs with an average clutch size of 71 eggs. [...] If siltation continues to worsen, many of the eggs will be smothered, resulting in reduced reproduction, further hindering the eastern sand darters' population count.|$|E
5000|$|This fish seeks {{its prey}} from the sand {{along the bottom}} of the stream or lake. “Their prey items usually range in size up to 3/16 inches, but prey {{selection}} varies depending on the age of the darter. Juvenile eastern sand darters consume small crustaceans, while adults prefer midge larvae, blackfly larvae, mayflies, and caddisflies.” [...] It has several species of fish predators, including rainbow trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and rock bass. However, due to extensive time spent buried in the sand and its translucent body, the <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> usually tends to be protected from predators. Minnows are the eastern sand darters' biggest competitor for food, but little conflict arises between the two due to the darter occupying the lowest depths of the rivers and lakes while the minnows occupy the upper water column.|$|E
50|$|Western <b>Sand</b> <b>Darters</b> {{primarily}} {{live in the}} Mississippi Basin, {{stretching from}} Minnesota to Louisiana. They tend to accumulate in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Arkansas. In these areas, the populations tend {{to have at least}} 10,000 individuals. Western <b>Sand</b> <b>Darters</b> prefer to live in rivers with gravel or loose sand sediment and moderate to swift currents.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{of small}} fish {{are the primary}} source of food for naked <b>sand</b> <b>darters.</b> They also feed on smaller {{crustaceans}} like copepods or clam larvae depending on their size. Naked <b>sand</b> <b>darters</b> feed continuously throughout the day, but stop at night. They also feed less in winter and summer months then pick back up before and after breeding season.|$|R

5000|$|Western Sand Darters {{are part}} of the Percidae family, which are slender fish that have {{translucent}} flesh. Their sizes can range from 1.7 to 2.6 inches. Clear flesh aids in making the fish look like the sandy bottom, a strategy used to evade predators. For some time, Western Sand Darters were grouped in the same category as Eastern Sand Darters. [...] They stemmed from the Eastern Sand Darters by scale counts, opercula structures and pigmentation. The Western Sand Darter only has 3-5 scale rows, thin opercula spine, and are less colorful compared to the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter.</b> Their scales are similar to placoid scales of cartilaginous fishes. Fish, such as sharks and rays, have hook like scales. Sand Darters have two dorsal fins that have spikes on them and a black stripe running from the anus to caudal fin.Caudal fins are the [...] "tail" [...] of most fishes. The type of caudal fin depends on the environment the fish lives in because it is the main propeller of a fish's movement. Western darters have a truncate fin. It's squared off at the corners and used for shorts bursts of swimming. Because of their lifestyle, darters have a body shape called [...] (spindle-shaped). This body, where the widest part of the fish is in the middle, produces as little drag as possible. These fish are swimming in fast currents have need to conserve energy while they're on the hunt. True spines are one of the characteristics of Perciformes. These spines are made out of bone, hence the name 'boney fish'. One of the more distinguishing features is the small sub terminal mouth. This occurs when the snout protrudes beyond the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Quantifying spatial genetic {{structure}} {{can reveal}} the relative influences of contemporary and historic factors underlying localized and regional patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow - important considerations {{for the development}} of effective conservation efforts. Using 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we characterize genetic variation among populations across the range of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter</b> (Ammocrypta pellucida), a small riverine percid that is highly dependent on sandy substrate microhabitats. We tested for fine scale, regional, and historic patterns of genetic structure. As expected, significant differentiation was detected among rivers within drainages and among drainages. At finer scales, an unexpected lack of within-river genetic structure among fragmented sandy microhabitats suggests that stratified dispersal resulting from unstable sand bar habitat degradation (natural and anthropogenic) may preclude substantial genetic differentiation within rivers. Among-drainage genetic structure indicates that postglacial (14 kya) drainage connectivity continues to influence contemporary genetic structure among <b>Eastern</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter</b> populations in southern Ontario. These results provide an unexpected contrast to other benthic riverine fish in the Great Lakes drainage and suggest that habitat-specific fishes, such as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter,</b> can evolve dispersal strategies that overcome fragmented and temporally unstable habitats...|$|E
40|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> (Ammocrypta pellucida) is {{dependent}} on fine sandy substrates that are naturally fragmented at depositional areas in freshwater lakes and rivers. Loss of suitable habitat {{is the leading cause}} of population declines across the entire species distribution. I identified genetic connectivity among drainages, rivers, and populations to determine how <b>eastern</b> <b>sand</b> <b>darter</b> genetic structure is shaped by historic drainage and contemporary river connectivity. Using microsatellite markers, I found that low gene flow among rivers resulted in persistent influences of historic drainage connectivity on current range-wide genetic structure. High within-river genetic connectivity, especially in range-edge rivers, is attributed to extinction/re-colonization events resulting from temporally unstable sand bar habitats, although genetic diversity is preserved through stratified dispersals. Fine-scale and temporal genetic analysis revealed that the Grand River likely represents recent colonization of populations, while the Thames River represents a potentially valuable source for future reintroduction recovery actions...|$|E

40|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter</b> (Ammocrypta pellucida) {{is listed}} as Threatened under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. Canadian populations are declining {{primarily}} due to the siltation of sandy depositional areas, the preferred habitat of the species. Little other relevant biological information is available for most Canadian populations and only limited information is available for populations in the United States. To supplement the paucity of information, this study collected biological information on A. pellucida during field surveys in 2006 - 2007 from 10 sites located around the Big Bend Conservation Area in the lower Thames River, Ontario, Canada. Collected data were used to estimate critical life history traits including: longevity, fecundity, clutch size and number, growth, survival, age-at-first-maturity and cohort age structure. Longevity was 3 + years, with age-at-first-maturity being 1 + for both sexes. A minimum of 2 clutches, were laid per year with an average clutch size of 71 eggs. Average density within {{in the study area}} was 0. 36 ± 0. 11 A. pellucida/m². Quantitative comparison of lower Thames River biological information with a more southerly A. pellucida population in the Little Muskingum River, Ohio, demonstrated little latitudinal variation between the populations. Data comparison suggests that localized environmental factors are affecting biological characteristics, in particular water temperature that may be controlled by differences in riparian cover and/or groundwater input. Field derived life history information was used to create a Leslie matrix model which was used for population viability analysis. Perturbation analyses of reproductive scenarios involving changes in clutch numbers and size and age-at-first maturity found large variations in the finite rate of population growth. Elasticity analyses further indicated that 0 + survival and 1 + fertility were the limiting life history parameters. Thus allowing fish to survive until first reproduction would have the largest overall impact on improving population viability. Inclusion of environmental stochasticity in the model facilitated estimation of extinction probabilities in the range of 0. 13 to 0. 21 within 100 years. Based on the above, it is recommended that management activities for protection and restoration of A. pellucida focus on habitat protection of nursery and spawning areas...|$|E

50|$|Their diet mainly {{consists}} of larval aquatic insects such as Mayfly nymphs, midge larvae, and hyalella. When an animal mainly consumes insects, they’re called insectivores. Larvae don’t have many nutritional advantages {{so it takes}} many larvae to feed Western <b>Sand</b> <b>Darters.</b> The fish are able to hunt {{by the use of}} the lateral line system. This system senses changes in water pressure in their environment. If an insect were to be moving on top of the water, the fish would be able to find the insect. They counteract this by having low metabolic needs. They don’t have to maintain homeostasis like endotherms must but their osmoregulation still takes up 25% of their metabolic needs. Scientists have observed a unique behavior that the Western <b>Sand</b> <b>Darter</b> does to save energy in fast current systems. The fish will bury themselves into the sandy bottom to reach cooler temperatures. Compared to the moving water, the sand is cooler. Fish metabolism slows in cooler temperatures and the fish can save energy.|$|R
