[...] Michael Shanks repeatedly stated in interviews that Claudia Black revitalized his interest in acting.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics are}} about the birth of Madonna's {{daughter}} Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'." [...] Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was about confronting the past, [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] conversely is about [...] "moving onward." ...|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Armstrong {{expanded}} on {{the song}} to NewReleaseTuesday: [...] "It's basically the keystone {{of the whole}} record, the embodiment of what the whole record will be about finding identity. I think that this song is more about realization; you wake {{up one day and}} you find yourself be something that you never wanted to be. You find that the world has <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>gotten</b> itself in your head and turned you into something that you were never really meant to be. This song is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> about a person screaming out with that realization, I'm hollow and faceless. I {{need to do something about}} this." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The guitar tones are {{a little}} cleaner than normal. We're <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> into this {{mind-set}} that clean is heavy. Clarity is a lot heavier than oversaturated. It's just real raw and natural and organic-sounding, which, in itself, is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> revolutionary these days, when kids are making pro audio-sounding recordings in their dorm rooms, on their laptops, and cutting and pasting verses and choruses. It's no longer cutting edge to make a completely space-aged, robotic-sounding record. I think it's almost fresh now to make one that sounds like an actual band played it. Don't get me wrong - it still sounds airtight and rehearsed, because it is all those things. But it's just real." ...|$|R

5000|$|I feel there's a {{recklessness}} {{about him}} that's maybe not normally {{associated with the}} Dark Side.
