It does this, in part, from the perspective of two comparable though very different case studies. In the case of Directorate-General Four (<b>DG</b> <b>IV)</b> of the Commission, which administers the Community's antitrust/competition and state aid control, it is possible to identify a distinctive set of beliefs linked to a commitment to neo-liberal values and a legalistic way of working. By contrast, Directorate-General Eleven (DG XI), the environment DG, has adopted a very specific world view based on the relationship between trade and ecological concerns. However, before looking specifically at these individual examples, this paper tentatively suggests ways in which administrative culture might be defined and used to explain certain elements of life within an institutional setting...|$|E
40|$|Shedding {{new light}} on the {{foundations}} of European competition law, this volume is a legal and historical study of the emerging law and its evolution through the 1980 s. It retraces the development and critical junctures of competition law not only {{at the level of the}} European Economic Community but also at the level of major Member States of the EEC. Intensely researched and rich with insights, the chapters in this volume reflect a close collaboration among an expert group of lawyers and historians and capitalize on previously unavailable source materials. The book examines several key themes including: the influence of national and international competition law on the development of EEC competition law; the drafting of the regulations that lead to the development of modern EU competition law; the role of the European Court of Justice in establishing the protection of competition as a central pillar of the Common Market; the internal dynamics, ideologies and tensions within the Competition Directorate General (<b>DG</b> <b>IV)</b> of the European Commission; and the role of industrial policy in European integration. Combining legal analysis with a meticulous excavation of historical evidence to reveal the forces driving key actors and the interactions among them, this volume rediscovers a past largely forgotten but essential to understanding the genesis of competition law in Europe, its role in Europe's construction, its hybrid institutional traits, and its often unique substance...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: About 50 % of {{indications}} for dialysis {{in acute}} renal failure are related to problems originated during the perioperative period. Intraoperative hemodynamic changes lead to renal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion. Previous studies have not defined the dexmedetomidine renal role in hemorrhage situations. This study evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on renal function and histology after acute hemorrhage in rats. METHODS: Covered study with 20 Wistars rats, anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg. kg- 1, intraperitoneal, randomized into 2 groups submitted to 30 % volemia bleeding: <b>DG</b> - <b>iv</b> dexmedetomidine, 3 µg. kg- 1 (10 min) and continuous infusion - 3 µg. kg- 1. h- 1; CG - pentobarbital. For renal clearance estimative, sodium p-aminohippurate and iothalamate were administered. Studied attributes: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, rectal temperature, hematocrit, iothalamate and p-aminohippurate clearance, filtration fraction, renal blood flow, renal vascular resistance, and histological evaluations of the kidneys. RESULTS: DG showed smaller values of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and renal vascular resistance, but iothalamate clearance and filtration fraction values were higher. There was similarity in p-aminohippurate clearance and renal blood flow. Both groups had histological changes ischemia-like, but dexmedetomidine determined higher tubular dilatation scores. CONCLUSION: In rats, after acute hemorrhage, dexmedetomidine determined better renal function, but higher tubular dilation scores...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{introduce}} several measures determined by a given finite directed graph. To construct σ-algebras for those measures, we consider several algebraic structures induced by G; (i) the free semigroupoid F + (G ˆ) of the shadowed graph G ˆ = G ∪ G − 1 (ii) the graph groupoid G of G, (iii) the disgram set <b>D(G</b> ˆ) and (<b>iv)</b> the reduced diagram set Dr(G ˆ). The graph measures µ G ˆ determined by (i) is the energy measure measuing how much energy we spent when we have some movements on G. The graph measures µ δ determined by (iii) is the diagram measure measuring how long we moved consequently from the starting positions (which are vertices) of some movements on G. The graph measures µ G and µ δ r determined by (ii) and (iv) are the (graph) groupoid measure and the (quotient-) groupoid measure, respectively. We show that above graph measurings are invariants on finite directed graphs, when we consider shadowed graphs are certain two-colored graphs. Also, we will consider the reduced diagram measure theory on graphs. In the final chapter, we will show that if two finite directed graphs G 1 and G...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{privatisation}} of {{the water}} industry in 1989, issues relating to the pricing of water, charging structures and the conduct {{of the water}} regulators have rarely been out of public attention. Water prices have increased ahead of inflation, in some cases by more than 10 per cent per annum, profits have been high, construction costs have fallen dramatically in the recession and the investment requirements to meet EC Directives have been revised upwards. In the first years following privatisation, the Director General (DG) of the Office of Water Services (OFWAT), the economic regulator of the industry, has, in the face of major shocks, used his discretion to intervene in the pricing and investment arrangements repeatedly. Indeed, the shocks have been so large that the DG has brought forward the review of the regulatory formula governing prices from 1999 - 2000 to 1994 - 95. It is this review of the price limits (called the Periodic Review) which {{is the subject of this}} paper. The review will be far reaching, involving decisions about the appropriate cost of capital for the industry, the valuation of existing assets, the capital expenditures required to meet environmental quality targets, and the level of operating costs and efficiency. To date, the DG has issued a series of consultation papers, culminating in Setting Price Limits for Water and Sewerage Services: The Framework and Approach to the 1994 Periodic Review, published in November 1993, which details his approach to the Periodic Review. The aim of this paper is to examine the economic principles underlying the DG’s approach and to consider the implications for the future of water regulation. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II provides an overview of the current regulatory regime, which was set up at privatisation. Section III considers how the regulatory framework has developed since 1989, with particular focus on the capital expenditure out-turn, shareholder returns and the revisions to the process instigated by the <b>DG.</b> Section <b>IV</b> analyses the <b>DG’s</b> approach to the Periodic Review and describes the ways in which pressure has been brought to bear on the various components of the capital expenditure, cost of capital, asset valuation and operating expenditure to reduce the rate of increase in prices. Section V provides an assessment of the prospects for the success of the DG’s approach. Finally, in Section VI, we summarise our main conclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} {{establish}} root nodule symbioses {{is restricted to}} four different plant orders. Soil actinobacteria of the genus Frankia can establish a symbiotic relationship with {{a diverse group of}} plants within eight different families from three different orders, the Cucurbitales, Fagales and Rosales. Phylogenetically, Frankia strains can be divided into four clusters, three of which (I, II, III) contain symbiotic strains. Members of Cluster II nodulate the broadest range of host plants with species from four families from two different orders, growing on six continents. Two Cluster II genomes were sequenced thus far, both from Asia. Results: In this paper we present the first Frankia cluster II genome from North America (California), Dg 2, which represents a metagenome of two major and one minor strains. A phylogenetic analysis of the core genomes of 16 Frankia strains shows that Cluster II the ancestral group in the genus, also ancestral to the non-symbiotic Cluster <b>IV.</b> <b>Dg</b> 2 contains the canonical nod genes nodABC for the production of lipochitooligosaccharide Nod factors, but also two copies of the sulfotransferase gene nodH. In rhizobial systems, sulfation of Nod factors affects their host specificity and their stability. Conclusions: A comparison with the nod gene region of the previously sequenced Dg 1 genome from a Cluster II strain from Pakistan shows that the common ancestor of both strains should have contained nodABC and nodH. Phylogenetically, Dg 2 NodH proteins are sister to rhizobial NodH proteins. A glnA-based phylogenetic analysis of all Cluster II strains sampled thus far supports the hypothesis that Cluster II Frankia strains came to North America with Datisca glomerata following the Madrean-Tethyan pattern...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the differences in local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) following cocaine and ethanol, alone and in combination. LCGU {{is a measure of}} neuronal activation of specific areas in the brain. Cocaine and ethanol have both been shown to activate many brain areas, some of which overlap, such as the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway (i. e., the postulated reward pathway). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the combination, cocaine and ethanol, would cause additive activation in these areas. Cocaine (5 mg/kg, intravenously (IV)) or ethanol (1 or 3 g/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)) were administered alone or in combination to five separate groups of male, Sprague-Dawley rats. A sixth group served as a control group with saline vehicle administered in lieu of the two drugs. Following drug administration, [14 C] 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -[14 C] <b>DG)</b> was injected <b>IV,</b> and rats were killed after 45 minutes. Brains were removed, processed and analyzed for LCGU. Cocaine treatment yielded no significant main or interactive effects in any brain region measured. The ethanol (1 g/kg) alone group was significantly increased beyond the high dose alone in specific regions, such as the caudate and mesocorticolimbic pathway. There were {{significant differences between the two}} groups given combination treatments, wherein the ethanol (1 g/kg) /cocaine group had potentiated levels of LCGU in the nucleus accumbens, caudate, mammillary bodies, thalamus and median raphe above that of high dose ethanol/cocaine. Overall, the lower dose of ethanol, regardless of cocaine treatment, increased levels of LCGU across most of the regions evaluated; in contrast, the higher dose of ethanol, regardless of cocaine treatment, did not increase LCGU. The results confirm the low-dose ethanol stimulatory effect on LCGU, whereas higher doses of ethanol were depressed relative to the low dose group, but comparable to saline controls. This effect remained true for ethanol co-administered with cocaine. The central hypothesis of an additive effect of cocaine and ethanol on LCGU was not supported.

Duas novas icnoesp??cies, Cruziana intermittens n. isp. e Tonganoxichnus itararensis n. isp. foram diagnosticadas. A an??lise das assembl??ias icnofossil??feras evidenciou a presen??a duas paleoicnocenoses distintas: (i) Paleoicnocenose A, contendo trilhas de deslocamento de artr??podes e escava????es rasas de artr??podes e de organismos vermiformes, vinculada ?? f??cies de ritmitos; e (ii) Paleoicnocenose B, reunindo exclusivamente escava????es mais profundas, vinculada ?? f??cies de dep??sitos heterol??ticos. Quatro su??tes distintas s??o observadas na Paleoicnocenose A: (i) su??te MP, contendo Maculichna varia, Protichnites isp., Diplichnites gouldi e Diplopodichnus biformis, com Kouphichnium isp. subordinado, vinculada aos ritmitos do tipo A; (ii) su??te HT, composta por Helmithoidichnites tenuis e Treptichnus pollardi, com Nereites isp. e Tonganoxichnus itararensis n. isp. subordinados, vinculada com os ritmitos do tipo B; (iii) su??te CR, contendo Cruziana problematica, C. intermittens n. isp., Rusophycus carbonarius e Gluckstadtella cooperi, com H. tenuis subordinado, vinculada aos ritmitos do tipo C; e (<b>iv)</b> su??te <b>Dg,</b> monoespec??fica para Diplichnites gouldi, preservada em palimpsesto sobre a su??te CR. A Paleoicnocenose B ?? formada por icnof??brica composta de Chondrites/Planolites, produzida em n??veis intermedi??rios do substrato, e Palaeophycus, em n??veis mais superficiais. As assinaturas icnol??gicas registradas sugerem um sistema deposicional estuarino do tipo fiorde, com a zona mais {{proximal}} do estu??rio situada a ENE (regi??o de Cachoeira do Sul) e a mais distal, a SSW (regi??o ao sul de S??o Gabriel-sudoeste de Lavras do Sul).

O contexto das paleoicnocenoses A e B e seus v??nculos faciol??gicos sugerem representar, respectivamente, uma Icnof??cies Scoyenia at??pica e uma Icnof??cies Cruziana empobrecida. De acordo com o registro global, a presen??a de G. cooperi, M. varia, T. pollardi e T. itararensis n. isp. nos ritmitos permitem supor uma idade Carbon??fero Superior para esses dep??sitos. The ichnotaxonomic {{review of}} the trace fossils from Itarar?? Group (Paran?? Basin, south of Brazil) in the Rio Grande do Sul State (southernmost Brazil) showed {{the presence of an}} ichnofauna dominated by arthropod trackways. Resting traces and intrastratal trails also made by arthropods and shallow burrows produced by soft-bodied organisms are subordinated, as well as a Chondrites-Planolites-Palaeophycus composite ichnofabic. Two new ichnospecies were diagnosed, Cruziana intermittens n. isp. e Tonganoxichnus itararensis n. isp. Two ichnocoenoses were differenciated: (i) Paleoichnocoenosis A, bearing arthropod trackways, resting traces, intrastratal trails and shallow burrows, related to the rhythmite facies; and (ii) Paleoichnocoenosis B, joining exclusively deeper burrows, related to the heterolithic deposit facies. Four distinct suites were observed in Paleoichnocoenosis A: (i) MP suite, having Maculichna varia, Protichnites isp., Diplichnites gouldi and Diplopodichnus biformis, with Kouphichnium isp. subordinated, and related to the rhythmites type A; (ii) HT suite, composed of Helmithoidichnites tenuis and Treptichnus pollardi, with Nereites isp. and Tonganoxichnus itararensis n. isp. subordinated, related to the rhythmites type B; (iii) CR suite, bearing Cruziana problematica, C. intermittens n. isp., Rusophycus carbonarius and Gluckstadtella cooperi, with H. tenuis subordinated, related to the rhythmites type C; and (<b>iv)</b> <b>Dg</b> suite, monospecific to Diplichnites gouldi, superimposed to the CR suite, in palimpsest preservation. The Paleoichnocoenosis B is formed by a composite ichnofabric of Chondrites and Planolites (deeper tier), and Palaeophycus (shallow tier). The recorded ichnological signatures suggest an estuarine, fjord-like depositional setting, the proximal zone extending to ENE (Cachoeira do Sul region) and the distal zone reaching the SSW (south of S??o Gabriel-southwest of Lavras do Sul). The rhythmites type B are concentrated in the proximal zone, the rhythmites type A and C, in the marginal plains, lateral to the main body water, and the heterolithic deposits characterize the estuary mouth, opening to the sea, under brackish water conditions. The ichnological and faciological characteristics of the paleoichnocoenoses A and B reveal the existence of an atypical Scoyenia Ichnofaceis and an impoverished Cruziana Ichnofacies, respectively, in the studied deposits. According to the global record, the presence of G. cooperi, M. varia, T. pollardi and T. itararensis n. isp. in the rhythmites allows to infer an Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) age to these rocks...|$|R
