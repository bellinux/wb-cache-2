In the process, we are also able to find a lower bound for diameters for the spherical Aleksandrov spaces, Sn/G, of cohomogeneities 1 and 2, as well as for cohomogeneity 3 (with some restrictions on the group type).

40|$|We {{present a}} method for giant lipid vesicle shape {{analysis}} that combines manually guided large-scale video microscopy and computer vision algorithms to enable analyzing vesicle populations. The method retains the benefits of light microscopy and enables non-destructive analysis of vesicles from suspensions containing up to several thousands of lipid vesicles (1 - 50 ¬µm in diameter). For each sample, image analysis was employed to extract data on vesicle quantity and size distributions of their projected <b>diameters</b> and isoperimetric <b>quotients</b> (measure of contour roundness). This process enables a comparison of samples from the same population over time, or the comparison of a treated population to a control. Although vesicles in suspensions are heterogeneous in sizes and shapes and have distinctively non-homogeneous distribution throughout the suspension, this method allows for the capture and analysis of repeatable vesicle samples that {{are representative of the}} population inspected...|$|R
40|$|We study flip-graphs of triangulations on topological {{surfaces}} where {{distance is}} measured by {{counting the number of}} necessary flip operations between two triangulations. We focus on surfaces of positive genus g with a single boundary curve and n marked points on this curve; we consider triangulations up to homeomorphism with the marked points as their vertices. Our main results are upper and lower bounds on the maximal distance between triangulations depending on n and {{can be thought of as}} bounds on the diameter of flip-graphs up to the quotient of underlying homeomorphism groups. The main results assert that the <b>diameter</b> of these <b>quotient</b> graphs grows at least like 5 n/ 2 for all g‚â• 1. Our upper bounds grow at most like [4 - 1 /(4 g) ]n for g‚â• 2, and at most like 23 n/ 8 for the torus. Comment: 22 pages, 13 figures.

40|$|Binuang is {{fast growing}} species which is native in Indonesia. This {{research}} is purposed {{to know the}} role of genetic variation to characteristic of binuang seedling {{at the age of}} 6 th and 10 th month from several mother trees from Pasaman, West Sumatera provenances in nursery. This research was arranged in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 22 pohon indukes and 5 replications. Each replication comprises 9 seedlings. Totally, there are 990 seedlings. The results showed that high genetic variation have effected observed traits of binuang seedlings. It showed by the high genetic variation of height, <b>diameter</b> and sturdiness <b>quotient</b> among binuang mother trees. Seedlings having the high value of diameter and height value of seedlings at all observation ages were from the same mother namely mother tree 17. Seedlings had the lowest average diameter at all observation ages were from the same mother namely mother tree 6. Whereas, seedlings had the lowest average height at 6 and 10 months were from mother tree 9, 7 and 6. Value of sturdiness quotient of seedlings from all mother trees at 6 and 10 months was above or classified high. Mother tree had the lowest sturdiness quotient at all observation ages was mother tree 19. The value of sturdiness quotient decreased along with increasing the age of binuang seedling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the diameter and spectral gap of finite groups. Our focus shall {{be on the}} asymptotic behaviour of these quantities for sequences of finite groups arising as quotients of a fixed infinite group. In Chapter 3 we give new upper bounds for the diameters of finite groups which do not depend on a choice of generating set. Our method exploits the commutator structure of certain profinite groups, in a fashion analogous to the Solovay-Kitaev procedure from quantum computation. We obtain polylogarithmic upper bounds for the <b>diameters</b> of finite <b>quotients</b> of: groups with an analytic structure over a pro- p domain (with exponent depending on the dimension); Chevalley groups over a pro- p domain (with exponent independent of the dimension) and the Nottingham group of a finite field. We also discuss some consequences of our results for random walks on groups. In Chapter 4 we construct new examples of expander Cayley graphs of finite groups, arising as congruence quotients of non-elementary subgroups of SL 2 (ùîΩ p [t]) modulo certain square-free ideals. We describe some applications of our results to simple random walks on such subgroups, specifically giving bounds on the rate of escape from algebraic subvarieties, the set of squares and the set of elements with reducible characteristic polynomial in SL 2 (ùîΩ p [t]) Finally, in Chapter 5 we produce new expander congruence quotients of SL 2 (‚Ñ§ p), generalising work of Bourgain and Gamburd. The proof combines the Solovay-Kitaev procedure with a quantitative analysis of the algebraic geometry of these groups, which in turn relies on previously known examples of expanders. </p...|$|R
40|$|P√≥ster presentado en la 11 th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics, celebrada en Pek√≠n del 29 de julio al 2 de agosto de 2014. Berry shape {{displays}} {{a wide range}} of phenotypic variation in grapevine and particularly among table grape cultivars where a broad diversity of shapes from spherical to cylindrical and horn types has been described. We are interested in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of berry shape variation in this species and thus we are following different approaches, from the phenotypic characterization at the morphological, histological and transcriptome levels to the genetic analyses of this trait within a collection of table grape cultivars as well as in a segregating F 1 progeny derived from the hybridization between Red Globe and Crimson Seedless cultivars. Morphological analyses suggested a relationship between the shape of the ovary in the flower at anthesis and the final fruit shape. The quantitative genetic analysis of berry shape was initially based on berry length, berry <b>diameter</b> and the <b>quotient</b> of both variables named as berry shape. For both berry length and diameter we detected a complex genetic structure including two major QTL in LG 5 and 18 and minor effect QTL in LG 1, 6, 12, 14 and 19. However, the final shape was mainly controlled by the QTL in LG 5 and other minor QTL that affected size through their specific effects on berry length or diameter. Furthermore, the genetic analysis of ovary shape in anthesis flowers, based on the evaluation of the same variables analyzed in fruits, confirmed the existence of both common and specific genetic determinants in the control of both the ovary and the fruit shape, which could suggest that fruit shape is partially determined during preanthesis flower development. Transcriptome comparison between preanthesis flowers from siblings with extreme spherical and elliptical berries in the Red Globe x Crimson Seedless F 1 progeny that were selected for their genotype at LG 5 QTL putatively conferring these phenotypes allowed the identification of putative candidate genes for this major effect QTL.
