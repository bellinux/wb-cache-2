40|$|Living organisms ≥ 10 μm and 3 ̆c 50 μm {{in ballast}} water {{discharged}} from ships are typically collected by filtering samples through a monofilament mesh net with pore openings sized to retain organisms ≥ 10 μm. This (or any) filtering method does {{not result in}} perfect size fractionation, and it can induce stress, mortality, and loss of organisms that, in turn, may underestimate the concentration of organisms within samples. To address this loss, the retention efficiency (RE) was determined for six filtration approaches using laboratory cultures of microalgae and ambient marine organisms. The approaches employed a membrane filter or mesh nettings of different compositions (nylon, stainless steel, polyester, and polycarbonate), nominal pore sizes (5, 7, and 10 μm), and filtering sequences (e. g., pre-filtering water through a coarse filter). Additionally, in trials with polycarbonate track etched (PCTE) membrane filters, water was amended with particulate material to increase turbidity. Organisms ≥ 10 μm were counted in the material retained on the filter (the <b>filtrand),</b> the material passing through the filter (the filtrate), and the whole water (i. e., unfiltered water). In addition, variable fluorescence fluorometry was used to gauge the relative photochemical yield of phytoplankton—a proximal measurement of the physiological status of phytoplankton—in the size fractions. Further, the mesh types and filters were examined using scanning electron microscopy, which showed irregular openings. The RE of cultured organisms— calculated as the concentration in the <b>filtrand</b> relative to combined concentration in the <b>filtrand</b> and the filtrate—was high for all filtration approaches when laboratory cultures were assessed (3 ̆e 93...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of the transport equation for uncharged macromolecules across a porous membrane developed by Verniory et al. (1973, J. Gen. Physiol. 62 : 489) has been tested on several types of artificial membranes (Amicon PM- 30, XM- 50, and XM- 100 Diaflo ultrafilters) using a pluridisperse solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone as <b>filtrand.</b> The influence of the filtration pressure on {{the shape of the}} sieving curve predicted by the theory has been verified. A mean pore radius and the width of the pore demonstrated that the method used previously to determine the effective filtration pressure in the glomerulus from sieving data is valid. The transport equation previously proposed by Renkin (1954, J. Gen. Physiol. 38 : 225) gives results that are less consistent than those obtained with the new transport equation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative {{agent of}} Buruli ulcer (BU). In West Africa {{there is an}} {{association}} between BU and residence in low-lying rural villages where aquatic sources are plentiful. Infection occurs through unknown environmental exposure; human-to-human infection is rare. Molecular evidence for M. ulcerans in environmental samples is well documented, but the association of M. ulcerans in the environment with Buruli ulcer has not been studied in West Africa in an area with accurate case data. Methodology/Principal Finding: Environmental samples were collected from twenty-five villages in three communes of Benin. Sites sampled included 12 BU endemic villages within the Ouheme and Couffo River drainages and 13 villages near the Mono River and along the coast or ridge where BU has never been identified. Triplicate water <b>filtrand</b> samples from major water sources and samples from three dominant aquatic plant species were collected. Detection of M. ulcerans was based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results show a significant association between M. ulcerans in environmental samples and Buruli ulcer cases in a village (p = 0. 0001). A ‘‘dose response’ ’ was observed in that increasing numbers of M. ulceran- positive environmental samples were associated with increasing prevalence of BU cases (R 2 = 0. 586). Conclusions/Significance: This study provides the first spatial data on the overlap of M. ulcerans in the environment and BU cases in Benin where case data are based on active surveillance. The study also provides the first evidence on M. ulcerans i...|$|E
40|$|In {{synovial}} joints hydraulic and turnover {{studies indicate}} that the synovial lining may partially reflect large macromolecules like hyaluronan, despite discontinuities in the lining cell layer. The reflection hypothesis was tested directly in the present study. Solutions of high molecular weight hyaluronan were infused at controlled pressures into the cavity of rabbit knees under anaesthesia, at concentrations of 0. 2 g l− 1 (n = 5), 2 g l− 1 (n = 5) and 4 g l− 1 (n = 6). Time-averaged trans-synovial flows were 9. 6, 4. 8 and 2. 9 μl min− 1, respectively. After 5 h infusion the intra-articular fluid was mixed and sampled. Hyaluronan concentration was determined by size-exclusion chromatography. In all sixteen experiments the hyaluronan concentration in the aspirate was greater than that in the infusate (P = 0. 0001, Student's paired t test). The increases averaged 2. 28 ± 0. 04 times at high filtration rates (0. 2 g l− 1 infusates; mean ± s. e. m.), 1. 60 ± 0. 09 times at intermediate filtration rates (2 g l− 1 infusates) and 1. 26 ± 0. 08 times at low filtration rates (4 g l− 1 infusates). Between 48 and 95 % of the hyaluronan in the <b>filtrand</b> was retained in the joint cavity. The greater retention at 2 g l− 1, viz. 95 %, than at 0. 2 g l− 1, viz. 48 %, was attributed to interactions between overlapping molecular domains in the more concentrated solution. It is concluded that synovial interstitial matrix can partially reflect hyaluronan molecules, and thus conserve intra-articular lubricant...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{transport}} equation describing {{the flow of}} solute across a membrane has been modified {{on the basis of}} theoretical studies calculating the drag of a sphere moving in a viscous liquid undergoing Poiseuille flow inside a cylinder. It is shown that different frictional resistance terms should be introduced to calculate the contributions of diffusion and convection. New sieving equations are derived to calculate r and A,/Ax (respectively, the pore radius and the total area of the pores per unit of path length). These equations provide a better agreement than the older formulas between the calculated and the experimental glomerular sieving coefficients for [6 I]polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) fractions with a mean equivalent radius between 19 and 37 A. From r and A,/Ax, the mean effective glomerular filtration pressure has been calculated, applying Poiseuille's law. A value of 15. 4 mm Hg has been derived from the mean sieving curve obtained from 23 experiments performed on normal anesthetized dogs. In 1951, Pappenheimer et al. developed the so-called "pore theory " to account for the transcapillary transport of uncharged, lipid-insoluble solutes in mammalian muscles (24). According to this theory, convective flow and net diffusion contribute to solute flow across the membrane, in this case the capillary walls, both processes being impeded by the steric hindrance at the entrance of the "pores " (supposed to exist between the cells) and by frictional forces within the pores (20, 22, 23, 25). The solute flow due to diffusion was calculated as D(c- c 2) AW/Ax X A,/A, where D is the free diffusion coefficient, cl and c 2, respectively, the solute concentrations in <b>filtrand</b> and filtrate and A,/Ax the pore area freely available to water per unit of length. The term A,/A, describes the restriction to the motion and can be calculated as 1 /K 1 X SD where SD = [1 -(a,/r) ] 2 is the steric hindrance term (a, is the radius of the solute molecule...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronan (HA), an anionic {{polysaccharide}} of synovial fluid, attenuates {{fluid loss}} from joints as joint pressure is raised (‘outflow buffering’). The buffering {{is thought to}} depend on the expanded molecular domain of the polymer, which causes reflection by synovial extracellular matrix, leading to flow-dependent concentration polarization. We therefore assessed the effects of polysaccharides of differing average molecular volume and charge. Trans-synovial fluid drainage(Q̇s) was measured at controlled joint fluid pressure (Pj) in knees of anaesthetized rabbits. The joints were infused with polydisperse HA of weight-average mass 2100 kDa (4 mg ml− 1, n = 17), with polydisperse neutral dextran of similar average mass (2000 kDa; n = 7) or with Ringer solution vehicle (n = 2). The role of polymer charge was assessed by infusions of neutral or sulphated dextran of average molecular mass 500 kDa (n = 6). When HA was present, Q̇s increased little with pressure, forming a virtual plateau of ∼ 4 μl min− 1 from 10 to 25 cmH 2 O. Neutral dextran 2000 failed to replicate this effect. Instead, Q̇s increased steeply with Pj, reaching eight times the HA value by 20 cmH 2 O (P = 0. 0001, ANOVA). Dextran 2000 reduced flows in comparison with Ringer solution. Analysis of the aspirated joint fluid showed that 31 ± 0. 07 % (s. e. m.) of dextran 2000 in the <b>filtrand</b> was reflected by synovium, compared with ≥ 79 % for HA. The viscometric molecular radius of the dextran, ∼ 31 nm, was smaller than that of HA (101 – 181 nm), as was its osmotic pressure. Anionic dextran 500 failed to buffer fluid drainage, but it reduced fluid escape and synovial conductance dQ̇s/dPj more than neutral dextran 500 (P < 0. 0001, ANOVA). The anionic charge increased the molecular volume and viscosity of dextran 500. The results support the hypothesis that polymer molecular volume influences its reflection by interstitial matrix and outflow buffering. Polymer charge influences flow through an effect on viscosity and possibly electrostatic interactions with negatively charged interstitial matrix...|$|E
40|$|High-throughput {{methods for}} the {{analysis}} of complex mixtures of sedimentary pigments have been developed by improving the efficiency and speed of pigment extraction and chromatographic analysis. A method for the routine and automated extraction of highly sensitive chlorin pigments from sediments has been developed and compared with the widely used method of sonic extraction. Pigments were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with on-line photodiode array detection and multistage tandem mass spectrometry. The efficacy and integrity of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) varies for temperatures within the range 20 oC to 175 oC. The pigment yields and absence of alteration products indicate 70 oC to be the optimal temperature for ASE in pigment analysis, yields and distributions of pigments being very similar to those obtained using sonication. Extraction time and solvent consumption are considerably lower than those for sonication, leading to increased efficiency and lower environmental impact and cost. Significant improvements in precision for quantification were achieved by freeze drying and sieving sediments prior to extraction. In addition, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method has been developed {{for the analysis}} of complex pigment distributions in natural samples, examining the effects of, and optimising, flow rate, injection volume, column length, mobile phase composition and column temperature. The new chromatographic methods have been demonstrated {{for the analysis of}} pigment compositions in an extract from sediment (Priest Pot, Cumbria UK) and a natural water-column <b>filtrand</b> (Little Long Lake). Detection and identification of components was achieved by online UV/Vis detector and multistage tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS 3). The separation, identification and confirmation by MS of photosynthetic pigments from Priest Pot and bacteriophaeophytin c and d homologues from Little Long Lake is achieved in under 18 min, five times faster than the established HPLC method. The new ASE and UHPLC methods were applied to the study of three sediment cores from Lake Heidi, Lake Nella and Lake 14, Larsemann Hills, Antarctica at high sampling resolution. The methods offer significant savings in time, solvent and sample consumption, have improved limits of detection and generate more reliable data. Hence, the use of the methods will enable the rapid screening of environmental samples and the profiling of sediment cores at high sampling resolutions within reasonable timescales...|$|E
