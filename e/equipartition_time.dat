Cross-reference analysis of the available JET experiments on MGI and their simulations with the TOKES code allow suggesting that in JET conditions one can convert into radiation the electron thermal energy and the plasma current energy, but the ion thermal energy does not convert into radiation because of very ineffective excitation of injected noble gas (NG) ions by D ions and long <b>equipartition</b> <b>time</b> between D ions and electrons.

40|$|The FPU problem, i. e., {{the problem}} of energy equipartition among normal modes in a weakly {{nonlinear}} lattice, is here studied in dimension two, more precisely in a model with triangular cell and nearest-neighbors Lennard-Jones interaction. The number n of degrees of freedom ranges from 182 to 6338. Energy is initially equidistributed among a small number n(0) of low frequency modes, with n(0) proportional to n. We study numerically the time evolution of the so-called spectral entropy and the related "effective number" n(eff) of degrees of freedom involved in the dynamics; in this (rather typical) way we can estimate, for each n and each specific energy (energy per degree of freedom) epsilon, the time scale T-n(epsilon) for energy equipartition. Numerical results indicate that in the thermodynamic limit the <b>equipartition</b> <b>times</b> are short: more precisely, for large n at fixed epsilon we find a limit curve T-infinity(epsilon), and T-infinity grows only as epsilon(- 1) for small epsilon. Larger <b>equipartition</b> <b>times</b> are obtained by lowering epsilon, at fixed n, below a crossover value epsilon(c) (n). However, epsilon(c) appears to vanish by increasing n (faster than 1 /n), and the total energy E=n epsilon, rather than epsilon, {{appears to be the}} relevant variable when n is large and epsilon <epsilon(c).

These results are shown to suggest a model of continuous preferential heating and acceleration of helium (or cooling and deceleration of hydrogen), which is cancelled or limited by Coulomb collisions by the time the plasma has reached 1 AU.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports {{an experimental}} study of ion heating and acceleration during magnetic reconnection, which is the annihilation and topological rearrangement of magnetic flux in a conductive plasma. Reconnection is invoked often to explain particle heating and acceleration in both laboratory and naturally occurring plasmas. However, a simultaneous account of reconnection and its associated energy conversion has been elusive due to the extreme inaccessibility of reconnection events, e. g. in the solar corona, the Earth's magnetosphere, or in fusion research plasmas. Experiments for this work were conducted on MRX (Magnetic Reconnection Experiment), which creates a plasma environment allowing the reconnection process to be isolated, reproduced, and diagnosed in detail. Key findings of this work are the identification of local ion heating during magnetic reconnection and the determination that non-classical effects must provide the heating mechanism. Measured ion flows are sub-Alfvenic and can provide only slight viscous heating, and classical ion-electron interactions can be neglected due to the very long energy <b>equipartition</b> <b>time.</b> The plasma resistivity in the reconnection layer is seen to be enhanced over the classical value, and the ion heating is observed to scale with the enhancement factor, suggesting {{a relationship between the}} magnetic energy dissipation mechanism and the ion heating mechanism. The observation of non-classical ion heating during reconnection has significant implications for understanding the role played by non-classical dissipation mechanisms in generating fast reconnection. The findings are relevant for many areas of space and laboratory plasma research, a prime example being the currently unsolved problem of solar coronal heating. In the process of performing this work, local measurements of ion temperature and flows in a well-characterized reconnection layer were obtained {{for the first time in}} either laboratory or observational reconnection research.

40|$|We present {{three-dimensional}} global numerical {{simulations of}} the cosmic-ray (CR) driven dynamo in barred galaxies. We study {{the evolution of}} the interstellar medium of the barred galaxy in the presence of non-axisymmetric component of the potential, i. e. the bar. The magnetohydrodynamical dynamo is driven by CRs, which are continuously supplied to the disk by supernova (SN) remnants. No magnetic field is present at the beginning of simulations but one-tenth of SN explosions is a source of a small-scale randomly oriented dipolar magnetic field. In all models we assume that 10 % of 1051 erg SN kinetic energy output is converted into CR energy. To compare our results directly with the observed properties of galaxies we construct realistic maps of polarized radio emission.

To overcome the so-called speed-stability paradox, in similar models the TF was considered as being present in two conformations (search state and recognition state) between which it switches stochastically. Combining both the facilitated diffusion model and alternating states, we obtain a generalized model. We explicitly treat bulk excursions for rodlike chains arranged in parallel and consider a simplified model for coiled DNA.

The major flare from December 1993 shows spectral evidence of three such self-absorbed components. The analysis yields an estimate of the power that is required to eject the plasmoids from the central engine that is independent of other estimates that exist in the literature for different flares. The technique has an advantage since the absorbed spectrum contains an independent constraint provided by the optical depth at each epoch of observation. The modeling procedure presented here self-consistently determines the dimensions of the radio emitting plasma from the spectral shape. Thus, structural dimensions are determined analytically that can be much smaller than interferometer beam-widths. A synthesis of the time evolution of the components allows one to address the fundamental uncertainties in previous estimates. First, the plasma is not protonic, but it is comprised of an electron-positron gas. The minimum electron energy is determined to be less than six times the electron rest mass energy. The analysis also indicates that the plasmoids are ejected from the central engine magnetically dominated. The temporal behavior is one of magnetic energy conversion to mechanical energy as the plasmoids approach <b>equipartition.</b> The <b>time</b> dependent models bound the impulsive energy flux, Q, required to eject the individual major flare plasmoids from the central engine to, 4. 1 × 10 ^ 37 erg/s< Q < 6. 1 × 10 ^ 38 ergs/s.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} cosmic magnetic fields {{is that they have}} been amplified from insignificant seed values to their present values by the turbulent dynamo inductive action driven by the plasma turbulent motions in the protogalactic and galactic medium. Up to now, in calculation of the turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no the back reaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic energy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the kinematic dynamo theory that has been well developed in the past. However, the applicability of the kinematic dynamo theory to protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies the temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by ions. As the magnetic field strength grows in time because of the dynamo action, the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized. As a result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity, and the magnetic field starts to strongly affect the turbulent motions on the viscous scales. Thus, in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field strengths much lower than those which correspond to energy equipartition between the field and the turbulence, and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo. The main purpose of this thesis is to lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic dynamo theory, and this could lead to the dynamo creation of cluster fields. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii viscosity can aid the development of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy, which happens after the energy <b>equipartition</b> <b>time.</b> iv Acknowledgements First, I thank my advisor, Russell Kulsrud, who was, in my opinion, the idea...|$|E
40|$|Nonequipartition {{between the}} {{electron}} and the ion temperatures, and nonequilibrium ionization {{are discussed in}} view of thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs). For electron heating due to Coulomb collisions with ions in the postshock region, an analytical solution is derived for the electron temperature under the adiabatic condition. By Taylor expansion of the solution, we obtain the electron temperature {{as a function of}} the electron density, time, and the shock velocity or the shock temperature T_s^. With <b>equipartition</b> <b>time</b> t _Eeq, the solution shows that the electron temperature increases to be approx 0. 1 T_s and 0. 3 T_s in 10 ^- 3 t_Eeq and 10 ^- 2 t_Eeq, respectively. The result is applied to the self-similar solutions for SNRs in the adiabatic phase, i. e., the free expansion phase and the Sedov phase. For SNRs expanding into a uniform density medium, our results predict much slower variation of the electron temperature than the case of full equipartition within the shock. We show the electron temperature plateau on the shocked matter of an SNR, and give analytical expressions of the electron temperature and the resultant free-free luminosity. In the free expansion phase, the electron temperatures of the reverse-and the blast-shocked matter are close to each other in comparison with the case of full equipartition, and their ratio is nearly constant for the ejecta envelope steepness. This results in a larger difference in the free-free luminosities of the two shocks than the case of full equipartition. Ionization processes are discussed in the framework of eigen-value problem to find the key matrix element which is a pivot of the transformation and gives the characteristic time constant. The ionization time approx 10 ^ 12 (n_e) ^- 1 s for the electron density n_e^, and has no systematic dependence either on the electron temperature or the atomic number. The emission from the shocked matter can scale as n_et, but its superposition on a t-old SNR expanding into a uniform density medium may be represented by a lower value than n_et expected from the ambient matter density and the age. Also the effect of the nonequilibria on the level populations is discussed in view of line emission processes. While innershell ionization followed by fluorescence lines is important in compression waves, radiative recombination followed by cascade lines is important in rarefaction waves. The rarefaction occurs and adiabatically cools the shocked matter rapidly when the shock wave breaks out of the dense circumstellar matter into the rarefied ambient medium. ...|$|E
