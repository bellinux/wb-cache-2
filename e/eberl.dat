5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, <b>Eberl</b> was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of {{the tens of thousands}} of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. <b>Eberl</b> was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E

5000|$|This {{in itself}} was a {{reliable}} indication as to the contemporary opinion {{of the quality of}} <b>Eberl's</b> works but we also have contemporary critical reviews of his works such as that of the influential Berlin Musical Journal which wrote in 1805, after a performance of his new symphony, [...] "Since the symphonies of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven, nothing but this symphony has been written which could be placed alongside theirs." [...] Indeed, <b>Eberl's</b> Symphony in E flat major was premiered at the same concert as Beethoven's Eroica Symphony on 7 April 1805, and it received rather more positive reviews than Beethoven's did.|$|R
500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus <b>Eberl</b> and Christian Prager in British Anthropological Reports, his name is {{composed}} of the elements [...] "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and [...] "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes. He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.|$|E
500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried <b>Eberl</b> was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed {{what was going to happen}} to them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. <b>Eberl's</b> {{ambition}} was {{to reach}} the highest possible numbers and exceed all the other camps. So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people {{could no longer be}} handled.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eberl's</b> artistic talent {{became obvious}} early on: in 1903 he was {{admitted}} to the local Academy of Fine Arts where he and fellow painter Emil Filla studied under Vlaho Buhovac. His artistic temperament, however, was incompatible with the Academy’s conservative tradition resulting in his leaving Prague and travelling Europe.|$|R
40|$|The thesis, in two parts, {{establishes}} a corpus of Viennese chamber music with clarinet and piano composed between 1783 and 1827 and develops {{strategies for the}} performance of this and other Classical music repertory. Extant evidence from both primary and secondary sources confirms that the clarinet was used in chamber music with piano in Vienna in advance of the rest of Europe. Much of that repertory has been located and inspected for the first time by the author. In Part I the corpus and its composers are examined, with emphasis given to hitherto unexamined contemporary reviews of the works and the role played by the clarinet within the varied duos, trios, quartets and larger configurations of instruments with piano. With works often being offered with instrumental options, the relationship between the clarinet parts and their string alternatives, most commonly the violin, is given special attention. By approaching works from differing analytical and historical perspectives a holistic overview is also presented. In that chamber music was largely pursued in the private sphere, few critical reports of performances of chamber music exist. No detailed review of a clarinettist's performance in a work of Viennese chamber music with piano has survived, so the reception of clarinet players in Vienna in other, more public genres is assessed in order to reveal the attributes of clarinettists most highly prized by Viennese commentators. In Part II the debates surrounding historically informed performance are surveyed, as are recent musicological developments in performer analysis. A multivalent strategy {{for the performance of}} this chamber music is proposed, derived from the topic theory of Ratner that is as contingent upon performer analysis as historical evidence of previous performance practice. This strategy is applied to three case studies from the repertory. A first appendix is a thematic catalogue of the corpus; a second appendix includes a performing edition of <b>Eberl's</b> Sonata in B flat major, Op. 10 no. 2 that is included in a recital of music from the corpus, submitted in partial fulfilment of the degree. ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{working in}} Bernburg SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried <b>Eberl</b> {{was a doctor}} and medical head of the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre with the same staff. Because of his {{experience}} in gassing, from summer 1942 <b>Eberl</b> was appointed commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp {{as part of the}} most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland known as Action Reinhardt. Irmfried <b>Eberl</b> was appointed the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was the only physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II.

40|$|The clarinet, violoncello, {{and piano}} trio is an {{important}} and viable chamber music genre. While many people {{are familiar with the}} Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms clarinet trios, few know many others. Through my research I found more than 125 trios for this combination. From the 74 scores previewed, I selected nine trios from the last two centuries as the focus of this project, "Selected Clarinet Trios: Unknown or Forgotten. " From the Classical period I selected Archduke Rudolph's Trio and Anton <b>Eberl's</b> Grand Trio, Op. 36. These trios are good examples of Classical performance style written by composers who were important historic figures and wrote several compositions for the clarinet. They highlight both the lyrical and virtuosic aspects of the clarinet while providing alternatives to the period's better-known clarinet trios. From the Romantic period I featured Louise Farrenc's Trio, Op. 44 and Carl Frühling's Trio in A moll, Op. 40. Farrenc's clarinet trio has stylistic elements from both the Classical and Romantic periods as well as German and French influences. In contrast Frühling's Trio in A moll is a late Romantic work, which showcases the best qualities of Romantic-style clarinet. Five trios are from the 20 th century. Robert Muczynski's Fantasy Trio, Op. 26 has distinctive motifs, transparent textures and lively asymmetric rhythms using the clarinet's large range and variety of musical sounds to enhance the combination of American music with "Bartokian" rhythms. Like a film score, Nino Rota's Trio (1973) features the lush harmonies and instrumental blends of the instruments depicting different characters and moods. Henryk Górecki's Recitativa i Ariosa "Lerchenmusik," Op. 53 highlights the unique sound qualities, alone and in concert, through his organic Polish-folk inspired minimalist style. Stephen Dankner's Trio (1991) takes the clarinet trios from Brahms to the neo-Romantic present providing beautiful lyrical passages for the clarinet while incorporating the influences and essence of American jazz. Daniel Lochrie's Phantasms (1994, rev. 2002) features a variety of rhythmic and lyrical passages combined with the tasteful use of contemporary clarinet techniques within a traditional framework...|$|R

5000|$|In October 1904 <b>Eberl</b> {{arrived in}} Munich and {{enrolled}} in the local Academy of Fine Arts. He received excellent reviews by his teachers, among them artist Franz von Stuck. Soon, <b>Eberl</b> became {{a teacher at the}} Academy himself; however, negative response to his publication of a few political drawings critical of Bavarian nobility caused <b>Eberl</b> to leave Germany. In 1911, <b>Eberl</b> settled down in the artists’ quarter of Montmartre and began showing his works in the famous Paris salons of the time.|$|E
50|$|After making {{only one}} Bundesliga {{appearance}} {{in two years}} at Munich, <b>Eberl</b> dropped down a division to the 2. Bundesliga to play for VfL Bochum. <b>Eberl</b> spent four seasons at Bochum, split evenly between the top two divisions, before moving to Greuther Fürth. He spent only 18 months playing for Greuther Fürth before moving to Borussia Mönchengladbach halfway through the 1998-99 season. <b>Eberl</b> saw {{out the rest of}} his career with Mönchengladbach, retiring in 2005. In a career lasting over 200 games in the first and second Bundesliga, <b>Eberl</b> did not score a single goal.|$|E
50|$|By 1920 <b>Eberl</b> francofied {{his name}} and became François Maurice <b>Eberl.</b> His career took off in that decade.

50|$|During the war <b>Eberl</b> married Frida Dohring, a Danish woman.
