The cyclin-dependent <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> p21 is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{have been}} {{hailed as a}} {{breakthrough}} {{in the treatment of}} cancer. Extensive research is now being devoted to the development of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> as a treatment for many nonmalignant diseases. However, the use of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in both malignant and nonmalignant diseases is also associated with side effects and the development of resistance. It may be worthwhile to explore whether cell-specific delivery of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> improves therapeutic efficacy and reduces side effects. Areas covered: This review aims to provide an overview of the preclinical studies performed to examine the specific targeting of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in vitro and in vivo. It gives an introduction to kinase signaling pathways induced during disease, along with the possible problems associated with their inhibition. It also discusses the studies on specific delivery and shows that altering the specificity of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> by targeting methods improves their effectivity and safety. Expert opinion: Compared with the delivery of cytotoxic compounds, the specific delivery of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has not yet been studied extensively. The studies discussed in this review provide an insight into methods used to target <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to different organs. The targeting of different <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has improved their therapeutic possibilities, but many questions still remain to be studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in cancer medicine has transformed chronic myeloid leukemia from a fatal disease into a leukemia subtype with a favorable prognosis by {{interfering with the}} constitutively active kinase BCR-ABL. This success story {{has resulted in the}} development of multiple <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> We are currently facing significant limitations in implementing these <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> into the clinic for the treatment of pediatric malignancies. As many hallmarks of cancer are known to be regulated by intracellular protein signaling networks, we suggest focusing on these networks to improve the implementation of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> This viewpoint will provide a short overview of currently used strategies for the implementation of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> as well as reasons why <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have unfortunately not yet been widely used for the treatment of pediatric cancers. We argue that by using a future personalized medicine strategy combining kinomics, proteomics, and drug screen approaches, the gap between pediatric cancers and the use of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> may be bridged...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant {{signaling}} causes many diseases, and manipu-lating signaling pathways with <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{has emerged}} as a promising area of drug research. Most <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> target the conserved ATP-binding pock-et; therefore specificity is a major concern. Proteomics has previously been used to identify the direct targets of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> upon affinity purification from cellular extracts. Here we introduce a complementary approach to evaluate the effects of <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the entire cell signaling network. We used triple labeling SILAC (sta-ble isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) to compare cellular phosphorylation levels for control, epi-dermal growth factor stimulus, and growth factor com-bined with <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Of thousands of phos-phopeptides, less than 10 % had a response patter...|$|R

25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{case study}} in rational drug design is imatinib, a tyrosine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> designed specifically for the bcr-abl fusion protein that is characteristic for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias (chronic myelogenous leukemia and occasionally acute lymphocytic leukemia).

40|$|Background: Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a clonal {{myeloproliferative}} disorder of myeloid progenitor cells.

Conclusions: Tyrosine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have changed the therapy of CML, the treatment of these patients is a long-term process.

25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the CDKN2 cyclin-dependent <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> family. p16 {{comprises}} four ankyrin repeats, each spanning a length of 33 amino acid residues and, in the tertiary structure, forming a helix-turn-helix motif. One exception is the second ankyrin repeat, which contains only one helical turn. These four motifs are connected by three loops such that they are oriented perpendicular to the helical axes.|$|E
25|$|CUL4B-based E3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase complexes often demonstrate overlapping {{activity with}} CUL4A-based complexes. Both CRL4 complexes utilize Cdt2 and the DNA processivity factor PCNA to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of replication licensing factor Cdt1 and cyclin-dependent <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> p21 in a proteasome-dependent manner. CRL4Cdt2 also degrades PCNA-bound PR-Set7/SET8, {{which is a}} histone 4 methyltransferase, and the p12 subunit of DNA polymerase δ, which is crucial for DNA replication. As a result, CRL4 complexes are {{able to control the}} onset of DNA replication, chromatin remodeling and progression through the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (cyclin-dependent <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5–10% of normal squamous epithelium. Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E
