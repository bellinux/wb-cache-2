40|$|Technical {{specifications}} of many Agencies {{are quickly}} moving from prescriptive to performance based, that requires field compliance {{tests of the}} constructed pavement, such as in situ pavement stiffness measurements by the Falling-Weight Deflectometer (FWD). This creates {{a number of issues}} for material suppliers, constructors, consultants, designers and end users who are now required to rely on data produced from such devices for design and compliance checks in the field. Whilst there is wide experience on the use of such devices, issues remain such as optimisation of test methodology, data interpretation and use, comparison between laboratory and in situ measured moduli. The aim of this work is to define a <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedure</b> and a framework for the analysis of results obtained by using such device to ensure high quality data and decision making, particularly for their role in performance based specifications. In a previous work, a particular testing and <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedure</b> have been proposed in order to evaluate strains in pavement layers directly from FWD deflections and pavement layer thickness; here the values of elastic modulus back-calculated in the previous work are compared with those of resilient modulus MR evaluated by laboratory tests carried out on cores taken from pavement. Stiffness Master Curves (SMC) have been developed by using the resilient modulus data determined at various test temperatures and loading frequencies, and they have been used for shifting data to the in-situ asphalt pavement conditions. The frequency spectrum of FWD load has been calculated in order to assume a representative loading frequency for this device. For this loading frequency, the back-calculated asphalt modulus has shown excellent correlation with the corresponding values of the SMC. This illustrates that reasonable estimates of the in situ asphalt modulus can be provided by using the Indirect Tensile Test for Cylindrical Specimens (IT-CY) protocol to determine resilient modulus on cores or specimens compacted in laboratory; values obtained by this test must be shifted to in situ test conditions in order to be related to in situ asphalt modulus values, and to be used with elastic theory in pavement design...|$|E
30|$|There are {{currently}} two approaches {{to measure the}} pore-pressure dependence of gas permeability in the laboratory. The first one is to simply perform a number of pulse-decay permeability tests with different gas pressures (Alnoaimi and Kovscek 2013). Then, these tests will provide gas permeability values {{for a number of}} gas pressures. The pulse-decay test setup generally consists of two gas reservoirs and a sample holder with controlled confining stress for test samples. Initially, the system is in equilibrium with a given gas pressure. A small pressure pulse is then introduced into the upstream gas reservoir, such that the pulse does not have a significant disturbance to the gas pressure in the system. The pressures at the two gas reservoirs are monitored as a function of time. The pressure evolution results are fitted using analytical solutions, with permeability being a fitting parameter. The advantage of this approach is that the test setup and <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedure</b> are relatively simple. However, it generally takes a relatively long time to equilibrate the test system from one test pressure to the next one (Jones 1997).|$|E
40|$|Attaching {{reinforcing}} material such as steel or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) plate {{to the external}} face of concrete members is a conventional technology used for strengthening concrete structures. Generally, three mechanisms {{are involved in the}} composite action between the concrete and the attachment: adhesion, dowel action, and friction. Methods have been developed for the identification of the interfacial bond properties when only one or two mechanisms exist at the interface. However, the existing methods cannot be used when all three mechanisms coexist. A methodology for testing the bond and the corresponding <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedure</b> are proposed in this work to identify the bond properties of the interface involving all bonding mechanisms. As the bonding mechanisms are coupled and interact with each other, it is impossible to test all of them individually and separately. The proposed test protocol involves an analytical procedure that decouples individual mechanisms from the global response curves. Furthermore, conventional bond test methods involve extensive and labor-intensive strain gauging as well as complicated data regression analyses of test results in order to obtain the bond properties. The proposed method requires only the simplest instrumentation to measure displacement and load, without strain gauging. Test data processing also involves simple graphical interpretations only, without complicated and tedious mathematical data regression analyses. Therefore, the proposed method has advantages over the existing ones and can be easily adopted in engineering practice...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} resonant column {{control system}} is introduced. The system {{is based on}} the concepts of energy injection and virtual mass. A unique feature of the system is that it allows the user to specify the resonant frequency and vibrating amplitude for a specimen of unknown mechanical properties. In the system a steady state vibration is maintained by injecting a dissipative energy that automatically compensates for the damping loss, and a prespecified resonant frequency is reached by adding a virtual mass such that the inertia term in the equation of motion matches the stiffness of the specimen for that frequency. This arrangement results in a continuous and automatic measurement of modulus and damping properties under clearly defined test conditions. As a result of automatic operation, the number of vibrating cycles is minimized and so is the disturbance to the soil specimen. In this paper, the principle, the system configuration, the control algorithm, and the calibration and <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedures</b> are presented. Verification and preliminary test results are reported...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made {{over the past few years}} in the development and regulatory adoption of in vitro and in chemico methods addressing key events of the skin sensitisation pathway. When used in isolation these methods are not able to generate information on skin sensitisation potential and potency comparable to that of the standard in vivo tests and for this reason they are proposed to be used in a weight-of-evidence assessment context within integrated approaches to testing and assessment. The integration of non-animal data from these methods using fixed <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedures,</b> within so called defined approaches, have been shown to have high accuracy in distinguishing between sensitisers and non-sensitisers and to provide information useful for the purpose of skin sensitisation potency subcategorization. This review provides an overview of the features of some of the defined approaches developed for skin sensitisation assessment and of their potential role within integrated approaches to testing and assessment. Challenges related to the international adoption and uses of defined approaches are also discussed. JRC. F. 3 -Chemicals Safety and Alternative Method...|$|R

40|$|An {{anonymous}} {{oil company}} released 2 D dynamite reflection {{data from the}} Illinois basin to be reprocessed and interpreted by Wright State University. The aim of the project is to exhaustively apply different seismic processing methods to the data to determine if any improvement in the imaging and interpretation may be accomplished. The <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedure</b> convolved extracted wavelets from the final migrated section with reflectivity calculated from well log data provided. Once major formation tops were identified attribute analysis was applied to locate potential oil volumes of interest. The raw shot records from this impulse data are dominated by guided (refracted) waves. A large number of shot records show a stationary seismic source generating coherent noise at the same receiver locations throughout the survey. Rather than simply edit the affected traces I investigated methods to filter this source of noise to maintain the fold of coverage. This investigation found that several FK filters combined with iterative application of residual statics and velocity analysis was very effective in removing both the guided waves and the stationary-source waves on the raw shot records, resulting in improvement of the imaging. Radon filtering was attempted to reduce multiples and for future marine studies. Two well logs were successful in creating synthetic seismic traces within {{the area of the}} data allowing a comparison to the migrated section and identification of the bottom of New Albany, top of Maquoketa, top of Trenton and the top of the Knox unit. AVO volume analysis of intercept and gradient revealed a type 1 anomaly at the Trenton since it has high impedance. An anomaly of interest is seen below the Trenton of unknown origin with the same characteristics. It was concluded the seismic processing provided an interpreted stack despite the noise present and a meaningful AVO attribute analysis could be performed...|$|E

40|$|Water content {{measurement}} using {{time domain}} reflectometry (TDR) is an important integral component of the Minnesota Road Research Project (Mn/ROAD) program. However, erroneous and inaccurate water content values are frequently generated using current <b>data</b> collection and <b>interpretation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Whereas the erroneous and obviously unreasonable values are caused by limitations of the current waveguide/cable systems, inaccurate water content values are most likely caused by the inadequacy of the empirical calibration equations. Base, Subbase, and Subgrade materials are different from agricultural soils in composition, water retention characteristics, and more importantly in their dielectric properties in relation to water content and temperature regimes in the road pavement. This project {{was to develop a}} new composition-based calibration between water content and apparent dielectric constant of the pavement materials. Temperature effect on the dielectric constants of water and pavement components was also integrated in the new calibration. Results indicated that the new calibration was more theoretically sound and relatively simple to use. Additional tests and developments may be needed to further validate the reliability of the new approach. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} family {{relations}} has an expressive role over the human existence and may constitute {{a context for}} processes of development and learning of competencies. It also contributes to the improvement of social structures. The bioecological approach of human development puts forward the importance of those and other interactions. This study aims to investigate the relational processes and mechanisms operating in the judiciary environment that attend poor families involved in judicial conflicts. The objectives are: to analyze the form of interactions established in the reception of families and to investigate factors which may decrease or increase familiar conflicts, turning into risk or protection conditions. The ecological engagement method was employed. Data collection instruments were: field book with in loco observations and interviews with district attorneys, judges, public defenders, social workers {{and members of the}} families in judicial conflict. <b>Data</b> <b>interpretation</b> followed <b>procedures</b> of textual analysis. Results indicate a belief system which involves the professionals and influences the quality of the connections between them and the families. On the other hand, the studied families denoted a distorted perception of the judicial system, which is not recognized as a locus of Estate power offered to the population to preserve its interests. The absence of understanding among the people who are involved in the process must be emphasized, since the distance between the population and the professionals is detected by a specific language employed by the judicial system. Another finding was the frequency of few and short meetings between both sides, professionals and families. These results point towards a disconnection between the professionals representing the judicial system in cases of family conflicts and the general population which may cause difficulties in the solution of the processes that should be under the protection established by the Federal Constitution as a duty of the Brazilian Estate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Data</b> <b>interpretation</b> is an {{essential}} element of mature software project management and empirical software engineering.

40|$|Abstract. In {{earthquake}} <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> process, <b>data</b> body precision {{would not}} be very high as the workload of <b>interpretation</b> or <b>data</b> memory. Using the interpolate method mentioned in this paper, we can finish the interpolation without increasing the workload of <b>interpretation,</b> increase earthquake <b>data</b> precision, and acquire more information from earthquake data. Significance of Earthquake <b>Data</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Interpolation Algorithm Earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> mainly comprises of two aspects: (1) stratigraphic calibration, in which a well layer sequence is established using VSP, synthetic data and other data, making geologic stratum and seismic reflection of well drilling corresponding with each other, and the interpreted target explicit [1]; (2) structural interpretation, including stratum tracking and fault interpretation. Stratigraphic and structural interpretations are inseparable: only fault interpretation and fault complex are correct, relative relationship between stratums can be correct and then communication between stratums can be ensured [2]. After earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> work is complete, 3 d data body of a block can be acquired, which comprises of data slices in directions of 3 d dimensional space, and also corresponding stratum curve or fault curve is acquired in each direction according to earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> result [3]. However, in ordinary circumstances, monitoring area for the acquisition of earthquake data is larger, but more detailed information can be provided by more precise data with regard to earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation.</b> However, this also means a greater data volume is necessary. Interpolation results with low precision can be selected {{through the application of}} interpolation algorithm in earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and then density of stratum curve is increased using interpolation, and thus stratum curve with high accuracy can be acquired...|$|R
