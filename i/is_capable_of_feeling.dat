60|$|Whatever is {{fitted in}} any sort to excite {{the ideas of}} pain and danger, that is to say, {{whatever}} is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, {{is a source of}} the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> I say the strongest emotion, because I am satisfied the ideas of pain are much more powerful than those which enter on the part of pleasure. Without all doubt, the torments which we may be made to suffer are much greater in their effect on the body and mind, than any pleasures which the most learned voluptuary could suggest, or than the liveliest imagination, and the most sound and exquisitely sensible body, could enjoy. Nay, I am in great doubt whether any man could be found, who would earn a life of the most perfect satisfaction at the price of ending it in the torments, which justice inflicted in a few hours on the late unfortunate regicide in France. But as pain is stronger in its operation than pleasure, so death is in general a much more affecting idea than pain; because there are very few pains, however exquisite, which are not preferred to death: nay, what generally makes pain itself, if I may say so, more painful, is, that it is considered as an emissary of this king of terrors. When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and with certain modifications, they may be, and they are, delightful, as we every day experience. The cause of this I shall endeavor to investigate hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|And yet Roxana {{is capable}} of fine feeling, as is proved by those tears of joy for the happy change in her fortunes, which bring about that {{realistic}} love scene {{between her and the}} Prince in regard to the supposed paint on her cheeks. Again, when shipwreck threatens her and Amy, her emotion and repentance are due as much to the thought that she has degraded Amy to her own level as to thoughts of her more flagrant sins. That she <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> gratitude, she shows in her generosity to the Quakeress. And in her rage and remorse, on suspecting that her daughter has been murdered, and in her emotion several times on seeing her children, Roxana shows herself a true woman. In short, though for the most part monumentally selfish, she is yet saved from being impossible by several displays of noble emotion. One of the surprises, to a student of Defoe, is that this thick-skinned, mercantile writer, the vulgarest of all our great men of letters in the early eighteenth century, seems to have known a woman's heart better than a man's. At least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women characters more alive than any of his men. It is another surprise that in writing of women, Defoe often seems ahead of his age. In the argument between Roxana and her Dutch merchant about a woman's independence, Roxana talks like a character in a [...] "problem" [...] play or novel of our own day. This, perhaps, is not to Defoe's credit, but it is to his credit that he has said elsewhere:[2] [...] "A woman well-bred and well-taught, furnished with the ... accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour, is a creature without comparison; her society is the emblem of sublime enjoyments; ... and the man that has such a one to his portion, has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful." [...] After reading these words, one cannot but regret that Defoe did not try to create heroines more virtuous than Moll Flanders and Roxana.|$|E

6000|$|All {{these facts}} {{with respect to}} music and impassioned speech become intelligible to a certain extent, if we may assume that musical tones and rhythm were used by our half-human ancestors, during the season of courtship, when animals of all kinds are excited not only by love, but by the strong passions of jealousy, rivalry, and triumph. From the deeply- laid {{principle}} of inherited associations, musical tones in this case {{would be likely to}} call up vaguely and indefinitely the strong emotions of a long-past age. As we have every reason to suppose that articulate speech is one of the latest, as it certainly is the highest, of the arts acquired by man, and as the instinctive power of producing musical notes and rhythms is developed low down in the animal series, it would be altogether opposed to the principle of evolution, if we were to admit that man's musical capacity has been developed from the tones used in impassioned speech. We must suppose that the rhythms and cadences of oratory are derived from previously developed musical powers. (39. See the very interesting discussion on the 'Origin and Function of Music,' by Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his collected 'Essays,' 1858, p. 359. Mr. Spencer comes to an exactly opposite conclusion to that at which I have arrived. He concludes, as did Diderot formerly, that the cadences used in emotional speech afford the foundation from which music has been developed; whilst I conclude that musical notes and rhythm were first acquired by the male or female progenitors of mankind for the sake of charming the opposite sex. Thus musical tones became firmly associated with some of the strongest passions an animal <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> and are consequently used instinctively, or through association when strong emotions are expressed in speech. Mr. Spencer does not offer any satisfactory explanation, nor can I, why high or deep notes should be expressive, both with man and the lower animals, of certain emotions. Mr. Spencer gives also an interesting discussion on the relations between poetry, recitative and song.) We can thus understand how it is that music, dancing, song, and poetry are such very ancient arts. We may go even further than this, and, as remarked in a former chapter, believe that musical sounds afforded one of the bases for the development of language. (40. I find in Lord Monboddo's 'Origin of Language,' vol. i. 1774, p. 469, that Dr. Blacklock likewise thought [...] "that the first language among men was music, and that before our ideas were expressed by articulate sounds, they were communicated by tones varied according to different degrees of gravity and acuteness.") ...|$|E

5000|$|Studies have {{attempted}} to more explicitly define the [...] of synesthetic responses. In most studies, participants are asked to observe someone else being touched and report what kind of synesthetic response they experience. In one particular instance, video clips were used to show different types of observed touch. The [...] of the synesthetic touch is not affected by {{the location of the}} observed touch (arm, leg, hand, etc.); however, it is sometimes affected by the spatial orientation of the observed touch. When crossed hands are touched, the hands become uncrossed in the perception of synesthetes. However when the observed hand is upside down, the observed touch does not get rotated. Intensity is also not affected if the observed act consists of someone touching themselves, versus someone touching them. Additionally, the type of object doing the touching has a significant effect on the intensity of the response. If a finger or knife tip is used, a much higher intensity is experienced than if a feather is used. Finally, watching a dummy being touched decreases the intensity of the observed touch significantly. For this reason, it is suspected that in order to experience a synesthetic touch, synesthetes must observe somebody who <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> sensations.|$|E

5000|$|... "Bad Girl" [...] is a pop ballad. It {{was written}} by Madonna, Shep Pettibone, and Anthony Shimkin and was {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone. Lyrically, the song is about a woman that is experiencing extreme sadness due to a failed relationship. As she lives her day-to-day life, she masks her pain through debauchery, engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as getting drunk, smoking, and engaging in one-night stands with random men. Throughout the song she expresses remorse for such [...] "bad" [...] behavior. According to the book The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, the song highlights the main theme explored throughout the Erotica album, which is [...] "the pain and torment {{of the heart and}} the perils of romance." [...] When it was released, the song was a departure from Madonna's highly sexualized image that she had at the time - which was bolstered by the extremely sexual nature of such songs as Justify My Love and Erotica - because instead of celebrating sex, it instead explored the complex emotional intersections of sex, power, and self-confidence. The tone of the song is melancholy and sobering, with Madonna delivering lines such as [...] "Bad girl, drunk by six, kissing some kind stranger's lips. Smoked too many cigarettes today, I’m not happy when I act this way." [...] In his book Madonna as Post-Modern Myth, author Georges-Claude Guilbert points out that the song, along with its music video, conveys a traditional moral message, adding that the song actually depicts a [...] "good" [...] girl, who <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> contrition for her immoral actions.|$|E

40|$|How come his {{contemporary}} age didn’t recognise {{the talent}} of the Danish, romantic poet Schack von Staffeldt? Were his thoughts too {{different from the}} philosophy that dominated the intellectual life in a Denmark heavily affected by the thoughts of the Enlightenment? This project examines the poetry of Schack von Staffeldt with a clear focus upon the poems evolving around the thoughts German literature theoretic and philosopher Friedrich Schlegel and Danish scientist and philosopher Henrich Steffens presented. The main thought of this period is that the poetry should be “a progressive universal poetry”. This means that the poetry should always aim at something: it shouldn’t just settle for something and then stop evolving. Schack von Staffeldts main problem finds its solution within this philosophy. He sees our world as a material and somehow unreal world, on the contrary {{to the world of}} Ideas, known from Plato, which he characterises as reality. Staffeldt longs for the eternity known from the world of Ideas. He wants to maintain the beauty of the world; he wants the three to bear both flowers and fruit at the same time. This is only possible to achieve, if he can drag the world of Ideas’ eternity into the material world. Both Steffens and Schlegel argue that the genius is the connector between these two worlds, because he <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> what’s not possible to recognise by empirical observations and rational thoughts. This ability gives the genius (and with that a human being) the power of God through something as irrational as longing and intuitive sensing.
