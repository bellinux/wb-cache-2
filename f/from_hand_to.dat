25|$|By 17 February, Soviet {{infantry}} and cavalry divisions supported by aircraft {{were less than}} 15 kilometers northeast of Tbilisi. The Georgian army put up a stubborn fight {{in defense of the}} approaches to the capital, which they held for a week in the face of overwhelming Red Army superiority. From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand in heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, bowed to the inevitable and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction. The Georgian government and the Constituent Assembly evacuated to Kutaisi in western Georgia, which dealt the Georgian army a significant moral blow.|$|E

[...] The entertainment business in the covered bazaars in the marketplace and at the entrances of bridges also provided a lowly means of occupation for storytellers, puppeteers, jugglers, acrobats, tightrope walkers, exhibitors of wild animals, and old soldiers who flaunted their strength by lifting heavy beams, iron weights, and stones for show. These people found the best and most competitive work during annual festivals. In contrast, the rural poor consisted mostly of peasant farmers. However, some in rural areas chose vocations centered chiefly around hunting, fishing, forestry, and state-offered occupations such as mining or working in the salt marshes.|$|E
500|$|Tracing is {{a process}} that allows for the {{recovery}} of property (such as land or money) by the owner if it is taken involuntarily, and the owner has not consented to the transfer of title. This can be through theft, breach of trust, or mistake. Owners can recover their property and perhaps also any profits made from it, or in situations where the property cannot be recovered (as it has been mixed in with other property, or cannot be found), substitute property. The process has two steps, following and tracing. In Foskett v McKeown, Lord Millett defined them by saying that [...] " [...] are both exercises in locating assets which may or may be taken to represent an asset belonging to the [...] and to which they assert ownership. The process of following and tracing are, however, distinct. Following is the process of following the same asset as it moves <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand. Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as the substitute for the old". Following, therefore, is simply establishing who the original owner of property is, where that property is, and returning it to the original owner. Tracing arises when the property cannot be returned and the court is asked to recognise an interest in new property, such as whatever the defendant received in exchange for the claimant's original property. Tracing can occur at both the common law and equity. It is not a remedy for breach of trust; tracing is merely the process of identifying the property. It is then up to the courts to decide what will happen to it.|$|E

The expressed view of some that this overwhelming majority was only due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections, however, is not accepted by all observers. Lefebvre was one of those who voted against the declaration, but he was one of those who added their signature to the document, after that of the Pope, though not all present did sign. Lefebvre later declared that the sheet of paper that he signed and that was [...] "passed <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand among the Fathers of the Council and upon which everyone placed his signature, had no meaning of a vote for or against, but signified simply our presence at the meeting to vote for four documents."

Bacterial transfer through foodservice quality gloves was quanti ed using nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes (a nonpathogenic surrogate with attachment characteristics similar to Salmonella). Five transfer rates were determined: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with low inoculum on <b>hands),</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with high inoculum on hands). At least 30 observations were made for each percent transfer rate using 30 individual volunteers. The logarithm of percent transfer data were then t to distributions: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> normal (0. 71, 0. 42); chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, gamma (5. 91, 0. 40, 25. 00); bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, logistic (1. 16, 0. 30); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (low inoculum), normal (0. 35, 0. 88); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (high inoculum), normal (22. 52, 0. 61).

2500|$|The novel's {{importance}} grew during World War II. Musa Dagh {{has often}} been compared to resistance in Jewish ghettos. Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote {{that it was the}} most-read book in the Warsaw ghetto. The Białystok Ghetto population found itself in a similar situation as Musa Dagh, in February 1943, when Mordecai Tannenbaum, an inmate of the Vilna ghetto, was sent with others to organize resistance there. The record of one of the meetings organizing the revolt, suggests that the novel was used as a guide for resistance: [...] "Only one thing remains for us: to organize collective resistance in the ghetto, at any cost; to consider the ghetto our 'Musa Dagh', to write a proud chapter of Jewish Białystok and our movement into history" [...] noted Tannenbaum. Copies of the novel were said to have been [...] "passed <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand" [...] among the ghetto defenders who likened their situation to that of the Armenians'. According to extensive statistical records kept by Herman Kruk at the Vilna ghetto library, the book was the most popular among ghetto readership, as is recounted in memoirs by survivors who worked at the library.|$|E

2500|$|To {{prepare for}} a scrum, each team's eight {{forwards}} (referred to as the pack or forward pack) bind together in three rows [...] the front row, second row and back row. The front row is composed of the two props and the hooker. To the left is the loosehead prop with the hooker in the middle, and the tighthead prop on the right (jersey numbers one, two and three). The [...] "tighthead" [...] prop, number three, earns that name as his head and shoulders sits between the hooker and the loosehead prop of the opposing side, meaning he sits in a [...] "tighter" [...] scrum position. The loosehead prop, by contrast, has one shoulder open {{to the outside of}} the scrum, and so is in a [...] "looser" [...] scrum position. The three bind together tightly and there is no gap between the hooker and either prop. According to the laws of the game; [...] "When a player binds on a team-mate that player must use the whole arm <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> shoulder to grasp the team-mate’s body at or below the level of the armpit."

2500|$|Sḵwxwú7mesh {{daily life}} {{included}} {{an array of}} games and sports. [...] One of the most well known games played was the bone game or slahal. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of [...] "bones", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of [...] "bones". When your team was guessing, your objective {{was to get the}} right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{prior to}} 1737 the {{economic}} motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take {{of the third}} night of a play. This {{could be a very}} large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, John Gay grew wealthy with The Beggar's Opera. In 1726, Leonard Welsted's indifferent success, The Dissembled Woman, was acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights. [...] After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more. [...] From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act. [...] Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his [...] "Glass" [...] character (often named [...] "Harold" [...] in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." [...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition.
