50|$|Some of the narrow-gauge former Feve lines, {{attractive}} to tourists in themselves {{and in the}} scenery they pass, are used by tourist trains, previously run by Feve, and by Renfe since 2013. These are the Estrella del Cantábrico between Oviedo and Covadonga, and the Transcantábrico between León and Ferrol vía Bilbao. The latter is a <b>de</b> <b>luxe</b> or super-de <b>luxe</b> <b>train.</b> These trains run on certain dates, mainly in summer, and include museum visits and gastronomic tourism.|$|R

50|$|The <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Fords of 1938 {{featured}} a more sloping hood and ornamental heart-shaped grille. This look was {{passed on to}} the standard line for 1939, as the <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Fords gained sharp v-shaped grilles with vertical bars. The standard line once again inherited the <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> look for 1940, this time with body-colored vertical bars. The 1940 <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford {{featured a}} three-part grille with horizontal bars.|$|R

50|$|The two {{previous}} Ford car lines, Standard and <b>De</b> <b>Luxe,</b> had blossomed into three, Special, <b>De</b> <b>Luxe,</b> and Super <b>De</b> <b>Luxe.</b> This time, the entry-level 136 CID (2.2 L) V8 was switched {{in favor of}} a new 226 CID (3.7 L) L-head straight-6, the first Ford six since the 1906 Model K. The popular 221 CID (3.6 L) V8 remained as the top-line engine and was standard in <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> models. Both engines were rated at 90 hp. The 239 CID engine, introduced in 1939 for Mercury and trucks, was continued in the Mercury models. The chassis was longer, with a 114-in (2.9-m) wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|For 1937, Ford updated its car lineup {{with minor}} styling changes. However, the {{introduction}} of the <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford marked the beginning of expansion of the Ford Motor Company brand lineup. <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford was marketed as an upscale sub-brand {{to bridge the gap between}} Ford and Lincoln-Zephyr. In 1939, the Mercury was launched; although sharing a chassis with the Ford, it wore a body six inches wider with a wheelbase four inches longer; Mercury would supersede <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford as a brand.|$|R

5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{introduced}} its <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford line in 1938 as an upscale alternative {{to bridge the}} gap between its base model (usually called Standard) and luxury Lincoln offerings. The [...] "Deluxe" [...] name was used intermittently before and after this to specify an upscale trim, but the <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford line was differentiated as a separate [...] "marque within a marque" [...] with separate styling and pricing through 1940. During 1939, Ford had five lines of cars: Ford, <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> Ford, Mercury, Lincoln-Zephyr, and Lincoln. After the war, this was simplified to Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln. The 1941 Ford line included [...] "De Luxe" [...] and [...] "Super De Luxe" [...] trim, but these vehicles were not marketed as a separate line. As Mercury sales progressed, the <b>De</b> <b>Luxe</b> approach was cancelled.|$|R
