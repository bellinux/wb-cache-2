Production and quality parameters are determined; among these are viscosity, composition, particle size distribution, processing variables and raw materials, and their effect on operation, safety characteristics, producibility, and physical and explosive properties. Pastes, <b>extrudables,</b> and PBX`s are among the formulations. One 20 -pound batch of XTX- 8003 was made to complete a milling study and two 28 -pound batches were made to fill an LRL order.

50|$|Olingos {{are similar}} to the {{kinkajou}} in morphology and habits. However, genetic studies have shown that kinkajous were an early offshoot of the ancestral procyonid line and are not closely related to any of the other extant procyonids, to which they are a sister group. This divergence is thought to have occurred about 22.6 million years ago. The similarities between the kinkajou and olingos are thus an example of parallel evolution; the closest relatives of the olingos are actually the coatis. The kinkajou is distinguished from olingos by its prehensile tail, its foreshortened muzzle, its <b>extrudable</b> tongue, and its lack of anal scent glands.

50|$|PETN {{is used in}} {{a number}} of compositions. It is a major {{ingredient}} of the Semtex plastic explosive. It is also used as a component of pentolite, a 50/50 blend with TNT. The XTX8003 <b>extrudable</b> explosive, used in the W68 and W76 nuclear warheads, is a mixture of 80% PETN and 20% of Sylgard 182, a silicone rubber. It is often phlegmatized by addition of 5-40% of wax, or by polymers (producing polymer-bonded explosives); in this form it is used in some cannon shells up to 30 mm caliber, though it is unsuitable for higher calibers. It is also used as a component of some gun propellants and solid rocket propellants. Nonphlegmatized PETN is stored and handled with approximately 10% water content. PETN alone cannot be cast as it explosively decomposes slightly above its melting point, but it can be mixed with other explosives to form castable mixtures.|$|E

In particular, it is shown that the optimal test configuration is when the pressure measurement is made directly inside the rheometer die.

40|$|International audienceReactive Powder Concrete (RPC) is {{well known}} for having ultra-high {{mechanical}} performances and a very good durability. The goal of our study is to find an <b>extrudable</b> RPC for concrete pipes manufacturing. Five RPC concrete mixtures (W/C = 0. 16) were synthesized with variable amounts of polycarboxylate superplasticizer, silica fume and crushed quartz. The first three compositions do not contain any crushed quartz and vary only by their increasing amount of superplasticizer. In the last two compositions, crushed quartz replaces a part of silica fume. Four of the formulations are <b>extrudable.</b> In this paper, we discuss the microstructure of the five samples before extrusion. A systematic study by scanning electron microscopy has been performed on polished sections and fractures. As expected for RPC, all the samples show a high amount of residual anhydrous clinker.

40|$|In this paper, time-continuous {{constitutive}} equations for strain rate-dependent {{materials are}} presented first, among which {{those for the}} overstress and the consistency viscoplastic models are considered. By allowing the stress states to be outside the yield surface, the overstress viscoplastic model directly defines the flow rule for viscoplastic strain rate. In comparison, a rate-dependent yield surface is defined in the consistency viscoplastic model, so that the standard Kuhn-Tucker loading/unloading condition still remains true for rate-dependent plasticity. Based on the formulation of the consistency viscoplasticity, a computational elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model is proposed for the short fiber-reinforced fresh cementitious paste for extrusion purpose. The proposed constitutive model adopts the von-Mises yield criterion, the associated flow rule and nonlinear strain rate-hardening law. It is found that the predicted flow stresses of the <b>extrudable</b> fresh cementitious paste agree well with experimental results. The rate-form constitutive equations are then integrated into an incremental formulation, which is implemented into a numerical framework based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA finite element code. Then, a series of upsetting and ram extrusion processes are simulated. It is found that the predicted forming load-time data are in good agreement with experimental results, suggesting that the proposed constitutive model could describe the elasto-viscoplastic behavior of the short fiber-reinforced <b>extrudable</b> fresh cementitious paste...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{describe}} the synthesis and the temperature-dependent behavior of photoreactive membrane lipids {{as well as their}} capability to study peptide/lipid interactions. The modified phospholipids contain an azide group either in the middle part or {{at the end of an}} alkyl chain and also differ in the linkage (ester vs ether) of the second alkyl chain. The temperature-dependent aggregation behavior of the azidolipids was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Aggregate structures were visualized by stain and cryo transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and were further characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). We show that the position of the azide group and the type of linkage of the alkyl chain at the sn- 2 position of the glycerol influences the type of aggregates formed as well as their long-term stability: P 10 AzSPC and r 12 AzSHPC show the formati on of <b>extrudable</b> liposomes, which are stable in size during storage. In contrast, azidolipids that carry a terminal azido moiety either form <b>extrudable</b> liposomes, which show time-dependent vesicle fusion (P 15 AzPdPC), or self-assemble in large sheet-like, nonextrudable aggregates (r 15 AzPdHPC) where the lipid molecules are arranged in an interdigitated orientation at temperatures below Tm (LÎ²I phase). Finally, a P 10 AzSPC:DMPC mixture was used for photochemically induced cross-linking experiments with a transmembrane peptide (WAL-peptide) to demonstrate the applicability of the azidolipids for the analysis of peptide/lipid interactions. The efficiency of photo-cross-linking was monitored by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) ...|$|E

30|$|Gadolinia-doped ceria ceramic pastes were {{formulated}} {{with different}} solid loadings and extruded using lab-scale equipment. The force {{to maintain a}} constant ram speed of 10 mm/min was recorded.

In order to obtain the apparent viscosity of the pastes, a novel approach based on the analysis of the slope of the extrusion pressure plot versus distance covered by the ram, was formulated for the direct determination of the shear stress upon extrusion. The agreement of the determined maximum solid loading with values calculated by two existing models confirmed that the proposed approach was an alternative and reliable method to identify the upper limit of the solid loading range for the formulation of <b>extrudable</b> ceramic pastes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} an {{experimental}} study on the mix design and the characterization of <b>extrudable</b> reactive powder concrete (ERPC) are presented. Five concrete mixes were prepared with variable amounts of polycarboxylate superplasticizer (SP), silica fume (SF) and crushed quartz (CQ).

Then, {{the influence of the}} dosages in SP, SF and CQ on early-age hydration rate, autogenous shrinkage, 28 -days mechanical performances, gas permeability, total porosity and chloride penetration rate was quantified. The increase in SP dosage caused a retardation of hydration and an increase of early-age autogenous shrinkage. Moreover, the partial substitution of silica fume with crushed quartz had a positive effect on hydration rate, autogenous shrinkage and mechanical properties. This result was mainly attributed to a higher amount of water available for cement hydration, induced by the coarser particle size distribution of crushed quartz as compared with silica fume...|$|E
