The Smith predictor {{consists of a}} process model and a pure <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> <b>element.</b> The process model re{{presents a}} first order plus dead time – FOPDT approximation of the actual process dynamics. Many technological processes can be approximated reasonably accurately with a FOPDT dynamic model. Even if the process to be controlled is not first order in its nature a FOPDT Smith predictor still {{can be used to}} provide better loop response. Advanced control structures are seldom used in processes controlled by a single PLC. Significant improvements can be made in the quality of the final products in manufacturing by reducing process performance variability...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{is considered an}} effective technique for aiding quadriplegic persons. However, the human musculoskeletal system has highly nonlinearity and redundancy. It is thus difficult to stably and accurately control limbs using FES. In this paper, we propose a simple FES method {{that is consistent with}} the motion-control mechanism observed in humans. We focus on joint motion by a pair of agonist-antagonist muscles of the musculoskeletal system, and define theelectrical agonist-antagonist muscle ratio (EAA ratio) and electrical agonist-antagonist muscle activity (EAA activity) in light of the agonist-antagonist muscle ratio and agonist-antagonist muscle activity, respectively, to extract the equilibrium point and joint stiffness from electromyography (EMG) signals. These notions, the agonist-antagonist muscle ratio and agonist-antagonist muscle activity, are based on the hypothesis that the equilibrium point and stiffness of the agonist-antagonist motion system are controlled by the central nervous system. We derived the transfer function between the input EAA ratio and force output of the end-point. We performed some experiments in an isometric environment using six subjects. This transfer-function model is expressed as a cascade-coupled <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> <b>element</b> and a second-order system. High-speed, high-precision, smooth control of the hand force were achieved through the agonist-antagonist muscle stimulation pattern determined by this transfer function model...|$|E

40|$|Precise and {{accurate}} {{determination of the}} <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> of a pulse counting system is critical for correct isotope ratio determinations. In this paper, potential problems in the determination of <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> are investigated {{as well as the}} consequences of using an erroneous value when correcting for <b>dead</b> <b>time.</b> It is shown how the voltage setting of a SEM can affect the <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> of the system. This can be due to an increased pulse height distribution giving after-pulsing effects, which are not corrected for by a detector <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> model. This hypothesis is supported by pulse height measurements of the output signal of the SEM. Output signals of the amplifier and SEM of an Element 2 are also studied and the different nature of these signals (extending vs non-extending) and the consequences of this in the correction of <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> count losses are discussed. It is also found that the <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> values determined via isotope ratio measurements can differ with up to 2. 7 ns under optimised instrumental settings, and it is also shown that a relatively small difference (2 ns) in the actual <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> of the system and the value used to correct for <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> results in apparent non-linearity of the system which has been reported by other authors.

Although individually small, when accumulated over an operating cycle, the voltage deviations are sufficient to distort the applied PWM signal. This paper presents a new method to correct for the <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> deviations. The Pulse Based Compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The pulse based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the pulse based technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters...|$|R
