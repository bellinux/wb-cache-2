In a major {{community}} survey, close to 30% {{of the respondents}} described the town as fine, good, nice, great, or pleasant; more than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> like the community or small town feel, while 46.3% enjoyed the friendly neighbourhoods. The most important municipal issues indicated by residents in 2008 were {{the need to improve}} the road system; traffic issues; increasing urbanization and overcrowding; land use development and sprawl; and the cost of living (including taxes and user fees) in the town. Environmental protection, including environmental assessments for new development and natural preservation measures, was identified as matter of high importance by residents, but low on a scale of satisfaction. In the hamlet of Musselman's Lake, 72% of residents in 2009 were concerned about the environmental health of the lake and the surrounding community. All municipalities in York Region except Whitchurch–Stouffville have an active Environmental Advisory Committee; the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville dismantled its committee after the municipal elections in 2006.|$|E

Of the US population, about 1.8% of persons self-identify as bisexual and 1.7% as homosexual according to a 2011 study from scholars at UCLA. In contrast, according to four different surveys 14–25% of the fandom members report homosexuality, 37–52% bisexuality, 28–51% heterosexuality, and 3–8% other forms of alternative sexual relationships. Approximately <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> reported being in a relationship, of which 76% were {{in a relationship with}} another member of furry fandom. Examples of sexual aspects within furry fandom include erotic art and furry-themed cybersex.

2500|$|In {{order to}} conduct this study, the {{pharmaceuticals}} were grouped by their therapeutic action {{in order to}} help participants identify them. [...] The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: antibacterials, antidepressants, antihistamines, antiepileptics, hormone treatments, and lipid regulators. [...] Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment. [...] Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals. [...] Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants. [...] The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male. [...] Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them. [...] Only <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.
