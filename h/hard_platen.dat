40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} paper and cardboard are important {{for the design of}} containers and of packaging. Amcor, a Melbourne-based producer of packaging, pulp and paper products, proposed the initial problem of explaining the large discrepancies which were sometimes observed between the nominal thickness, as determined by <b>hard</b> <b>platen</b> measurements, and the effective thickness which would account for the experimentally measured values of bending stiffness. The question was also raised {{as to whether or not}} ultrasonic waves could be used to measure directly, and on-line, the effective thickness. Paper can be regarded as a fibre-composite material, with a pronounced anisotropy due to the preferential alignment of fibres in the machine direction as a consequence of the manufacturing process. The salient features of elastic (ultrasonic) wave propagation in an anisotropic plate will be presented, with an emphasis on addressing the questions raised above. In particular, it will be noted that the characterization of the first anti-symmetric (flexural) mode should provide a convenient on-line measurement of the flexural stiffness, which is the more relevant property for quality control and structural design than the effective thickness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} {{uniaxial}} compression testing of spherical particles can give unambiguous {{access to their}} tensile strength as governed by surface flaws if one uses pairs of elasto-plastic platens, tailoring their hardness {{in order to control}} the relative area of particle-to-platen contact during the test. This eliminates the development of contact microcracks that are typically found to govern particle fracture when <b>hard</b> <b>platens</b> are used. We show that, if the platen materials are well chosen, one can probe a range of stress states for which it is known that particle failure was initiated along the surface, under elevated hoop stress within a region situated remote from the points of load application. Specifically, platens must be chosen such that particles tend to fracture when the ratio of projected contact area radius to particle radius exceeds a specific value that depends on the Poisson ratio of the particles. With fused quartz of Poisson ratio 0. 17, this specific ratio value equals 0. 65. We demonstrate the approach using microscopic fused quartz spheres 40 ± 20 µm in diameter as a testbench material; with those particles hardened steel serves as an appropriate platen material. Their strength values are statistically distributed; this is addressed using several platen materials. The resulting bank of data is interpreted using established survival-analysis methods, namely the non-parametric product-limit estimator. We also give a maximum likelihood estimation of the particle strength Weibull distribution parameters derived from the ensemble of data after left-truncation and/or right-censoring of data points situated inside of the range of unambiguous surface fracture strength measurement for each platen material. This gives a Weibull modulus of 6. 3 and characteristic strength of 890 MPa for the fused quartz particles. These values are significantly lower than what is produced in high-strength fused quartz fibers of comparable diameter; the difference is most likely a result of surface damage caused during powder storage and manipulation {{in the absence of a}} protective coating...|$|R
