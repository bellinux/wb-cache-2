500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like most of {{his fellow}} inmates, Fujita was {{returned}} to the United States {{over a period of}} several weeks in late 1945. Fujita travelled via train to Texas, and via bus to Abilene, arriving in October. He recorded later that [...] "I walked past my mother and baby sister without recognizing them. My mom must have been drowsy, or the sight of me froze her to immobility, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> or three people past her before she came into action." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Cliff smiled. She {{was used}} {{to this sort of}} talk from Nancy Shott. [...] "I am better than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years ago," [...] she said, [...] "and the last time I was weighed I found that I had gained seven pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "St. Louis. I {{was brought}} to this country before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years old, from France. Mrs. Holt brought me. And I have never been out of St. Louis since, except to go to Sutcliffe. There you have my history. Mrs. Holt would {{probably}} have told it to you, if I hadn't." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> {{years of}} age she asked me not to drink, and then I made a {{resolution}} of total abstinence. That I have adhered to it and enjoyed the beneficent effects of it through all time, I owe to my grandmother. I have never drunk a drop from that day to this {{of any kind of}} water.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't;--because you and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two.</b> When a {{young man}} and a young woman <b>are</b> <b>two</b> they shouldn't kiss any more. That is logic." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "One of the nastiest {{pieces of}} water in the world," [...] he concurred. [...] "Eighteen years ago the Plate gave it to me--lost half our sticks, twenty hours on our beam-ends, cargo shifted, and foundered. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> days in the boat before an English tramp picked us up. And none of the other boats ever was picked up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{discourage}} your high spirit, but I must {{ask you to}} approach this matter seriously. Marriage would do you a world of good, Sam. It would brace you up. You really ought to consider the idea. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years younger than you are when I married your poor mother, {{and it was the}} making of me. A wife might make something of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's more nor I {{can tell}} ye, lad. As far as I remimber, I began with murphies, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> foot high, in my father's cabin in ould Ireland.

6000|$|... "Don't {{try to get}} up, Aggie," [...] Mrs. Walsham said. [...] "You are {{faint and}} shaken with all this excitement. Your grandpapa and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> very foolish people, to let you come out.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; I'm so forgetful nowadays," [...] said old Mrs. Hagburn; [...] "only {{it seems}} as if I had my {{memories}} in my pipe, and they curl up in smoke. I've known these Feltons all along, or {{it seems as}} if I had; for I'm nigh ninety years old now, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> year old in the witch's time, and I have seen a piece of the halter that old Felton was hung with." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE MAIDEN. My poor Strephon: I pretended I {{was only}} two for your sake. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> when you were born.

But now I {{seem to have lost}} it altogether: bigger things are taking possession of me. Still, we were very happy in our childish way for the first year, werent we? ...|$|E
50|$|In a set-theoretical definition, named {{sets are}} built using sets similar to constructions of fuzzy sets or multisets. Namely, a set-theoretical named set is a triad X = (X, f, I), in which X and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> sets from K and f is a set-theoretical {{correspondence}} (binary relation) between X and I. Note {{that not all}} named sets are set-theoretical. The most transparent example of non-set-theoretical named sets is given by algorithmic named sets, which have the form X = (X, A, I), in which X and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> constructive objects, for example, sets of words, and A is an algorithm that transforms X into I.|$|R
50|$|A named set X has {{the form}} of a triad X = (X, f, I), in which X and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> objects and f is a {{connection}} between X and <b>I.</b> It <b>is</b> represented by the fundamental triad in the following diagram.|$|R

6000|$|... "Exactly. Well, I {{naturally}} sent {{a resume}} {{of the information}} to Berlin. Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that {{he was aware of}} what had been said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. You've no idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years living it down. Now you, with this sporting pose of yours--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} stupid, Anna," [...] she said. [...] "Can you not understand? It {{is of no}} use your taking my {{identity}} and all the burden of my iniquities upon your dear shoulders if I am to be recognized the moment I show my face in London. That is why I have dyed my hair, that is why I have abandoned my rôle of ingenuèe and altered my whole style of dress. Upon my word, Anna," [...] she declared, with a strange little laugh, [...] "you are a thousand times more like me as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> months ago than I am myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] Lord Arranmore said, quietly. [...] "I am {{obliged to}} you, Hennibul, but {{the matter is}} one which does not admit of outside interference, however kindly. Besides, the boy is right. I {{wilfully}} deserted both him and his mother, and she died during my absence. My life, whilst away from them, was the sort one forgets--or tries to--and he knows about it. Further, when I returned to England <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> years before I took the trouble {{to go and see}} him. I merely alluded to these domestic matters that you might not wholly misjudge the situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At rest!" [...] said she. [...] "How sweet {{it must be}} to rest after labours such as yours! Though you and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two,</b> Mr. Robinson, who {{was once}} one, still I hear of you, and--sometimes think of you." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{young girl}} was silent a moment. [...] "My sister and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> very {{different}} persons," [...] she presently said. [...] "She {{has been a}} great deal in Europe. She has been in England several times. She has known a great many English people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was fifteen, {{my mother}} {{gave me this}} wheel, and said: 'Now, {{daughter}} Betsey, {{it is time for}} you to begin your wedding outfit, for I mistrust you'll marry young.' In those days girls spun and wove webs of fine linen and laid 'em up in chests, with lavender and rosemary, for sheets and table-linen after they married. So I spun away, making all manner of fine plans in my silly head, for I was a pretty piece, they all said, and young as <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>two</b> or three fine lads used to come evenings and sit staring at me while I worked.|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. Yes. Thats {{an idea of}} mine. I knew a chap named Joey Percival at Oxford (you know <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> {{months at}} Balliol before I was sent down for telling the old woman who was head of that silly college what I jolly well thought of him. He would have been glad to have me back, too, {{at the end of}} six months; but I wouldnt go: I just let him want; and serve him right!) Well, Joey was a most awfully clever fellow, and so nice! I asked him what made such a {{difference}} between him and all the other pups--they were pups, if you like. He told me it was very simple: they had only one father apiece; and he had three.|$|E
60|$|Before me {{the pale}} serpent-girdled {{section of the}} sun sank and sank, and the {{advancing}} shadow swept to seize the sphere before I could reach it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> miles away, a hundred leaps or more, and the air about me was thinning out as it thins under an air-pump, and the cold was gripping at my joints. But had I died, I should have died leaping. Once, and then again my foot slipped on the gathering snow as I leapt and shortened my leap; once I fell short into bushes that crashed and smashed into dusty chips and nothingness, and once I stumbled as I dropped and rolled head over heels into a gully, and rose bruised and bleeding and confused as to my direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{stick to}} the tips your clients slip into your hand, my dear young lady," [...] he advised, [...] "and don't dabble in what you don't understand. The Stock Exchange is a den of thieves, and Maurice here and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> of the worst examples." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{appeared}} {{to take her}} view of this. “My sister and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> very different persons. She {{has been a great}} deal in Europe.
