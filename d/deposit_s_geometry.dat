The act itself is physically straightforward, merely involving the system 2 ̆ 7 s center of mass and achieving a static equilibrium between the opposing torques caused by gravity and the normal force between the container and the surface on which it balances.

The purpose of such analysis is threefold: first, when considering a rectangular container, to determine the relationship between the angle at which it balances and the amount of fluid in the container; second, to consider a massless analogue to a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can which balances at a fixed angle and observe the interplay between the various parameters of that container 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> and balance; and finally, to revisit the aluminum can model, this time considering its mass relative to the fluid 2 ̆ 7 s, and recover the familiar behavior observed when balancing real-world beverages in aluminum cans...|$|R

These are a well-behaved class of graph rewriting systems. Here, two applications are explored.

40|$|Ultrasound Imaging {{has been}} favored by clinicians for its safety, affordability, accessibility, and speed {{compared}} to other imaging modalities. However, the trade-offs to these benefits are a relatively lower image quality and interpretability, which can be addressed by, for example, post-processing methods. One particularly difficult imaging case {{is associated with the}} presence of a barrier, such as a human skull, with significantly different acoustical properties than the brain tissue as the target medium. Some methods were proposed in the literature to account for this structure if the skull 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> is known. Measuring the skull 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> is therefore an important task that requires attention. In this work, a new edge detection method for accurate human skull profile extraction via post-processing of ultrasonic A-Scans is introduced. This method, referred to as the Selective Echo Extraction algorithm, SEE, processes each A-Scan separately and determines the outermost and innermost boundaries of the skull by means of adaptive filtering. The method {{can also be used to}} determine the average attenuation coefficient of the skull. When applied to simulated B-Mode images of the skull profile, promising results were obtained. The profiles obtained from the proposed process in simulations were found to be within 0. 15 λ ± 0. 11 λ or 0. 09 ± 0. 07 mm from the actual profiles. Experiments were also performed to test SEE on skull mimicking phantoms with major acoustical properties similar to those of the actual human skull.

Design/methodology/approach: PU leather and PVC leather <b>deposit</b> <b>S.</b> S nano-films on the surface of PU and PVC leathers in this study. The interfacial nanostructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experimental results revealed that the surface roughness of the substrates had extremely important influence on the morphology of nano-films. The adhesions of the S. S coating to the PU and PVC leathers were investigated by the peel-off test. Findings: The results showed that the adhesive performance of the S.

Moreover, a weight loss of per peeling force calculating formulation is proposed to determine the bonding strength between the S. S films and the substrates. Originality/value: In this paper, influence of different substrates on surface morphology of S. S coating was studied by SEM and AFM. Moreover, the weight loss of per peeling force calculating formulation was used to discuss the bonding strength between the S. S coating and the substrates.

Host rocks for gold mineralization are the Permian Park City dolomite and siltstone and the Kirkman-Diamond Creek sandstone. The gold deposit is approximately 430 m long, 370 m wide, up to 90 m thick and contains 8. 5 {{million metric tons}} (t) of reserves averaging 1. 6 g/t gold. Intrusive igneous rocks are conspicuously absent. The gold <b>deposit</b> <b>s</b> located on the northern flank of the northeast-trending Copperton anticline, an overturned box fold. A small east-striking, south-dipping thrust fault, the Barneys Canyon thrust fault, with 200 m displacement, repeats the Park City Formation, and north-south-striking steep normal faults form a graben in which the gold <b>deposit</b> <b>s</b> located. The Barneys Canyon thrust fault predates mineralization a d the Phosphate normal fault postdates mineralization. Alteration of the host rocks is similar to other sediment-hosted, disseminated gold deposits but at lower alteration mineral abundances. Kaolinitc and illitc comprise l ss than 10 percent of the altered rock. Silicifica-tion is minor, barite is rare, and pyrite and marcasite are common, but not abundant. Trace As, Sb, Hg, T 1, and Ba shmv pronounced increase. K/At age determinations onvein illitc from ore grade (1. 5 ppm gold) bedding-plane gougelike material yield Jurassic ages. Fluid inclusion measurements from barite and jasperold show a mean salinity of 1. 7 wt percent NaC 1 equiv and homogenization temperatures of 130 ø to 393 øC with weak modes at 350 and 230 øC, suggesting that two fluids have interacted with rocks at Barneys Canyon.
