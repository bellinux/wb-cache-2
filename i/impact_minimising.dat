40|$|Nursing {{students}} are not always well prepared {{for the kind of}} adverse events they may experience in the workplace and yet it seems apparent that future students could benefit from learning about such experiences {{so that they can be}} avoided, or their <b>impact</b> <b>minimised.</b> This research aimed to identify nursing students' experiences of adversity, collaborate with the students to discern important lessons for future students in their experiences, and make recommendations for other educators on how to use these stories as lessons. Seven Australian nursing students were interviewed using critical incident technique consisting of 7 questions. This paper focuses on the responses to the questions: "Does this story's message have a place in the curriculum?" and "How would you teach this lesson?" Data were analysed using critical discourse analysis. Four recurring discourses emerged including: power relationships are a two-way street; learn from mistakes to prevent mistakes; begin cultural consciousness-raising in first year, first semester; and become critically self-aware. Narratives derived from original stories of adversity may be a valuable source of learning about the realities of the workplace but to benefit fully, educators need to assist students to notice and analyse embedded messages...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{and organic}} {{agriculture}} {{in particular are}} developing rapidly, due not only to technological change but also to changes in agricultural policy and public expectation. Research allows new knowledge to be developed and is thus vital {{for the future of}} organic agriculture. We can ask the question, {{what is the purpose of}} research on organic farming? Is it to increase yield and productivity, to compare it with other forms of agriculture, or to quantify its environmental and social <b>impact,</b> <b>minimise</b> the adverse effects and maximise the benefits etc? The answer is of course that research has a role to play in all of these and many other aspects of developing the organic food chain. The precise purpose of the research is usually defined by the funder, and may differ with whether the funder is from the public or private sector. In this chapter we look briefly at the development of organic research through both the public and private sector and go on to explore some of the issues that surround research on organic agriculture in terms of approaches and appropriate methodologies. We also explore the extent to which organic and conventional agriculture require different research and different approaches to research...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} natural {{antioxidant}} active packaging is increasing {{due to its}} unquestionable advantages compared {{with the addition of}} antioxidants directly to the food. Therefore, the search for antioxidants perceived as natural, namely those that naturally occur in herbs and spices, is a field attracting great interest. In line with this, in the last few years, natural antioxidants such as α-tocopherol, caffeic acid, catechin, quercetin, carvacrol and plant extracts (e. g. rosemary extract) have been incorporated into food packaging. On the other hand, consumers and the food industry are also interested in active biodegradable/compostable packaging and edible films to reduce environmental <b>impact,</b> <b>minimise</b> food loss and minimise contaminants from industrial production and reutilisation by-products. The present review focuses on the natural antioxidants already applied in active food packaging, and it reviews the methods used to determine the oxidation protection effect of antioxidant active films and the methods used to quantify natural antioxidants in food matrices or food simulants. Lastly consumers' demands and industry trends are also addressed.

40|$|Many Australian {{sedimentary}} basins are prospective for {{unconventional gas}} and the undiscovered resource base is very large. The technology (such as horizontal wells, multi-well pads and hydraulic fracturing) {{is available to}} produce shale gas (and shale oil and tight gas) in Australia, but production costs {{are likely to be}} significantly higher than those in North America and the lack of infrastructure will further add to costs. Shale gas will not be cheap gas in Australia, but {{it is likely to be}} plentiful and it has the potential to be an economically very important additional energy source. Increased use of shale gas (and other gas) for electricity generation could significantly decrease Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions based on gas replacing coal. Because of the manner in which shale gas is produced it has the potential to impact on the landscape, on ecosystems, on surface and groundwater, on the atmosphere, on communities, and rarely may result in minor induced seismicity. It will be vital for industry and government to recognise the complexity of the challenges posed by these possible impacts. However, most can be minimised where an effective regulatory system and best monitoring practice are in place and can be remediated where they do occur. If the shale gas industry is to earn and retain the social licence to operate, it is a matter of some urgency to have such a transparent, adaptive and effective regulatory system in place and implemented, backed by best practice monitoring in addition to credible and high quality baseline surveys. Research into Australia’s deep sedimentary basins and related landscapes, water resources and ecosystems, and how they can be monitored, will be essential to ensure that any shale gas production is effectively managed and the <b>impacts</b> <b>minimised...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{promoters}} {{of the large}} groundwater developments implemented in the 1970 's {{paid little attention to}} the effects of pumping on soil moisture. A field study, conducted in 1979 in the Tern Area of the Shropshire Groundwater Scheme, revealed that significant quantities of the available moisture could be removed from the root zone of vegetation when drawdown of shallow watertables occurred. Arguments to this effect, supported by the field study evidence, were successfully presented at the Shropshire Groundwater Scheme public inquiry. The aim of this study has been to expand the work which was undertaken in connection with the Shropshire Groundwater Scheme, and to develop a method whereby the effects of groundwater pumping on vegetation can be assessed, and hence the <b>impacts</b> <b>minimised.</b> Two concepts, the critical height and the soil sensitivity depth, formulated during the initial work are {{at the core of the}} Environmental Impact Assessment method whose development is described. A programme of laboratory experiments on soil columns is described, as is the derivation of relationships for determining critical heights and field capacity moisture profiles. These relationships are subsequently employed in evaluating the effects of groundwater drawdown. In employing the environmental assessment technique, digitised maps of relevant features of the Tern Area are combined to produce composite maps delineating the extent of the areas which are potentially sensitive to groundwater drawdown. A series of crop yield/moisture loss functions are then employed to estimate the impact of simulated pumping events on the agricultural community of the Tern Area. Finally, guidelines, based on experience gained through evaluation of the Tern Area case study, are presented for use in the design of soil moisture monitoring systems and in the siting of boreholes. In addition recommendations are made for development of the EIA technique, and further research needs are identified...|$|R
