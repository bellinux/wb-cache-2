In recent years, the disturbance of the landscape owing to surface mining activities seems to be {{one of the most}} significant issues to deal with, as it raises serious conflicts between the public and the extractive industry. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt an environmentally friendly design for an excavation of any possible degree. Thus far, existing visual-impact assessment methodologies provide little support towards this direction as a consequence of their, mainly, qualitative character. In this paper we describe a new, more quantitative, methodological approach which is based on the measurement of topographic relief alteration caused by mining and quarrying works, and which makes use of modern mining software and geographic information systems tools. The methodology provides the means to adjust the excavation design in a way that minimizes visual impacts caused by the landform reprofiling. It can be applied in every stage of the life of a mine project. Moreover, if modified, it can also be used for the estimation of topographic relief alteration in projects within the construction sector that involve significant <b>earthmoving</b> <b>works.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{equipment}} requires specialized tires {{for various}} construction applications. While {{many types of}} equipment have continuous tracks applicable to more severe service requirements, tires are used where greater speed or mobility is required. An understanding of what equipment {{will be used for}} during the life of the tires is required for proper selection. Tire selection can {{have a significant impact on}} production and unit cost. There are three types of off-the-road tires, transport for <b>earthmoving</b> machines, <b>work</b> for slow moving earth moving machines, and load and carry for transporting as well as digging. Off-highway tires have six categories of service C compactor, E earthmover, G grader, L loader, LS log-skidder and ML mining and logging. Within these service categories are various tread types designed for use on hard-packed surface, soft surface and rock. Tires are a large expense on any construction project, careful consideration should be given to prevent excessive wear or damage.|$|R
50|$|Roller-compacted concrete, {{sometimes}} called rollcrete, is a low-cement-content stiff concrete placed using techniques borrowed from <b>earthmoving</b> and paving <b>work.</b> The concrete {{is placed on}} the surface to be covered, and is compacted in place using large heavy rollers typically used in earthwork. The concrete mix achieves a high density and cures over time into a strong monolithic block. Roller-compacted concrete is typically used for concrete pavement, but has also been used to build concrete dams, as the low cement content causes less heat to be generated while curing than typical for conventionally placed massive concrete pours.|$|R

40|$|Infant {{botulism}} is {{a disease}} that occurs in infants between 1 and 52 weeks years of age when spores of Clostridium botulinum are ingested. These spores germinate and produce neurotoxins in the large intestine lumen. These toxins act at the neuromuscular junction blocking release of acetylcholine neurotransmitter. Clinical severity varies from a mild hipotony to systemic flaccid paralysis. It has even been considered {{as the cause of}} infant sudden death. C. botulinum spores are commonly found in soil samples and aquatic sediments throughout the world. Honey is the most well-documented food source of C. botulinum spores for infants although corn syrup, infant formulas, dry cereals, plants infusions and dust have been also associated with infant botulism. However, for the majority of cases the source of the causative spores remains unclear. Researchers have also stressed the importance of the child’s natural environment that may facilitate the exposure to C. botulinum spores. Contact with dust or soil in houses from rural areas, where farming activities are carried out, has also been cited as a risk factor. As well as urban areas with big areas under construction involving <b>earthmoving</b> or restoration <b>works</b> in buildings. It is considered that the minimum infective dose of spores of C. botulinum may be as low as 10 - 100 spores. Current epidemiological data indicate that the risk of disease is low in infants less than 1 year old by avoiding the consumption of honey and/or plants infusions...|$|R

No entanto, apesar dos custos envolvidos com equipamentos serem os itens de maior peso na construÃÃo rodoviÃria, poucos sÃo os sistemas existentes de apoio Ã decisÃo para a seleÃÃo das frotas. Propostas de seleÃÃo de frotas tÃm sido elaboradas por pesquisadores no Brasil e no mundo, porÃm a maioria consideram apenas caminhÃes e escavadeiras/carregadeiras ou scrapers. Este trabalho tem como objetivo desenvolver um sistema de apoio Ã decisÃo na seleÃÃo de motoniveladoras para a execuÃÃo de obras de terraplenagem e de pavimentaÃÃo, denominado SADPATROL. Inicialmente, foi feita uma anÃlise da evoluÃÃo tecnolÃgica do equipamento motoniveladora visando verificar a influÃncia destas melhorias sobre o aumento da produtividade. Foram analisadas as equaÃÃes existentes na {{literatura}} para o cÃlculo de produtividade e apÃs verificada a representatividade da equaÃÃo utilizada no paÃs esta foi escolhida para compor o SADPATROL, com as devidas alteraÃÃes em suas variÃveis. AtravÃs da anÃlise de cada variÃvel da equaÃÃo foi possÃvel identificar o quanto as mesmas influenciavam no resultado da produÃÃo desta forma, foram implementadas melhorias, como a inserÃÃo de valores padrÃes para as variÃveis do sistema, permitindo a obtenÃÃo de resultados mais precisos, caso o usuÃrio nÃo possua dados medidos em campo. O SADPATROL possui cadastrado em seu banco de dados 46 tipos de motoniveladoras, dos mais variados modelos e tamanhos, de 12 fabricantes distintos. Ã possibilitado ao usuÃrio calcular a frota com equipamentos prÃprios e verificar se esta atende ao prazo da obra. Caso o prazo nÃo seja atendido pela frota prÃpria ou o usuÃrio nÃo possua equipamentos, o sistema executa as informaÃÃes da obra para todos os equipamentos do banco de dados e fornece a soluÃÃo com as 46 opÃÃes organizadas em frotas, em ordem crescente de quantidade de equipamento. Ã possibilitado ainda selecionar os equipamentos nos quais se possui informaÃÃo de custo horÃrio, para assim obter a frota de menor custo. Toda a multiplicidade de informaÃÃes necessÃrias Ã seleÃÃo de motoniveladoras, e suas inter-relaÃÃes e dependÃncias, foram organizadas de forma sistÃmica no software SADPATROL, diminuindo assim o empirismo e a dependÃncia da experiÃncia humana na seleÃÃo de frotas. A presente pesquisa pode ainda contribuir para auxiliar a elaboraÃÃo de normas tÃcnicas e para a disseminaÃÃo do conhecimento sobre o referido equipamento. The {{demands on}} speed {{and efficiency of}} infrastructure design and construction has increased due {{to the use of}} software and more productive equipment, which has required better performance of equipment planners at each step. However, even considering that the costs associated with equipment are one of the items with the greatest weight in road construction, there are few computerized systems for fleet selection decision support. Fleet selection systems have been developed by researchers in Brazil and worldwide, but most of them consider only trucks and excavators/loaders or scrapers. This research aims at developing a decision support system for the selection of motor graders for construction activities involving <b>earthmoving</b> and paving <b>works</b> named SADPATROL. Initially, an analysis of the motor grader technological evolution was performed in order to evaluate the influence of the improvements on productivity gains. The equations presented in the literature were studied for productivity calculation and, after verifying the suitability of the equation, the equation was incorporated in the SADPATROL system with the necessary changes in its variables. Through the analysis of the variables in the equation, it was possible to identify how they influenced the productivity. Through this analysis, improvements were implemented. These improvements consisted of the inclusion of standard values for the system variables, allowing the achievement of more accurate results if the user has no data for productivity measured in the field. The SADPATROL system has 46 types of motor graders included in its database, from many different models and sizes and from 12 different manufacturers. The user is able to plan the fleet with its own equipment and verify if it satisfies the construction project deadline. If the deadline cannot be satisfied using the available fleet or the user has no equipment, the system performs the construction planning using all database equipment and provides the optimal solution with 46 options organized into fleets in increasing order according to the amount of equipment needed. It is also possible for the user to select the equipment using time cost information and, thus, achieve the lowest cost fleet. The significant amount of information necessary for motor graders selection and its inter-relationships and dependencies were organized in a systematic way in the SADPATROL system, reducing, the empiricism and the dependence on human expertise in selecting fleets. This research may also help in assisting in the development of technical standards and expanding the dissemination of knowledge about such equipment...|$|R
