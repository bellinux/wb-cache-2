50|$|Hypervolemia, or fluid overload, is {{the medical}} {{condition}} {{where there is}} too much fluid in the blood. The opposite condition is hypovolemia, which is too little fluid volume in the blood. <b>Fluid</b> <b>volume</b> <b>excess</b> in the intravascular compartment occurs due to an increase in total body sodium content and a consequent increase in extracellular body water. The mechanism usually stems from compromised regulatory mechanisms for sodium handling as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF), kidney failure, and liver failure. It may also be caused by excessive intake of sodium from foods, intravenous (IV) solutions and blood transfusions, medications, or diagnostic contrast dyes. Treatment typically includes administration of diuretics and restriction of the intake of water, fluids, sodium, and salt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Fluid {{resuscitation}} following burn injury must support organ perfusion {{with the}} least amount of fluid necessary and the least physiological cost.

Instead, administration of <b>fluid</b> <b>volumes</b> well in <b>excess</b> of historic guidelines has been reported. A number of strategies including greater use of colloids and vasoactive drugs are now under investigation to optimize preservation of end organ function while avoiding complications which can include respiratory failure and compartment syndromes.

The DSS is developed based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) technique which is ideal for developing input/output models in an unstructured and imprecise environment. The fuzzy rules used in the DSS are derived automatically from the clinical data produced in surgical operations. The DSS employs a Multi Rule Base (MRB) learning scheme to adapt its model according to the significant variation in the physiological parameters of a patient. The performance of the developed algorithms is validated through experimental work using clinical data. The results obtained so far are encouraging...|$|E
40|$|Background. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to theoretically quantify the fluctuations of <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> <b>excess</b> for different modes of intermittent ultrafiltration schedules and to compare the prediction for the typical and asymmetric thrice-weekly schedule to clinical, phys-iological and biophysical markers of volume expansion in a group of stable haemodialysis patients. Methods. Overall volume excess (VOVE) was described as the sum of a time-independent (V 0) and a time-depen-dent component (V¯). An exact relationship was devel-oped to relate V ¯ to variable treatment frequency, treatment spacing and net volume accumulation rate. In a single-centre haemodialysis population, body mass profil-ing was combined with volume state evaluation by bioim-pedance analysis, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) levels, clinical signs, a volume questionnaire and blood pressure levels. Results. In 23 patients following the typical thrice-weekly schedule, the time-averaged volume excess (V¯) during the whole week (1. 1 ± 0. 5 L) was significantly larger than that during the midweek interval (0. 9 ± 0. 4 L) (P < 0. 002) by a factor comparable to that of 1. 21 obtained from the theoreti-cal analysis. VOVE was 1. 3 ± 1. 7 L and significantly related to pre- (P < 0. 001) and post-dialysis levels of NT-pro BNP (P < 0. 001). Conclusion. Asymmetric treatment spacing such as with the typical thrice-weekly treatment schedule leads to a significant increase in time-averaged volume excess. The theoretical anal-ysis allows for comparison of time-averaged volume excess in treatments varying with regard to treatment frequency and regularity and could be helpful to prescribe post-treatment volume (target weight) for such variable treatment modes...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 INTRODUCTION: Over {{1 million}} Americans {{currently}} {{live with a}} lower limb amputation. Lower limb prostheses {{have been designed to}} produce a secure and comfortable fit between residual limb and prosthesis throughout the day. However, significant <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> fluctuations in the residual limb deteriorate socket fit and may cause decreased mobility due to discomfort or soft tissue injury from increased pressures and shear stresses. Extracellular fluid is thought to be the primary source of limb volume fluctuation and commonly decreases {{over the course of the}} day. Technologies designed to address limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss are ineffective and cumbersome. Methods to assess limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change are also poor, lacking the capability to quantify <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss at high temporal resolution and while the prosthesis is donned. METHODS: Bioimpedance analysis provides tools to rapidly estimate extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> while a subject performs regular activity with the prosthesis donned. Using a custom bioimpedance analyzer, we tested 16 subjects each on three separate occasions in a repeated measures study. Each test session consisted of an activity sequence followed by a 30 minute period of calm sitting (dubbed the recovery sit). During the recovery sit, subjects sat with their prosthesis donned (ON), prosthesis doffed (OFF), or liner donned (LINER). An identical activity sequence followed the 30 minute sit. RESULTS: Volume changes during the OFF 30 minute recovery sit were significantly higher than during ON (p < 0. 001). We observed that after the limb gained <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> during the OFF protocol, subsequent volume loss was negligible in 12 of 16 subjects during the following activity sequence. Conversely, volume lost during the 30 minute recovery period during ON was not recovered during three cycles of activity. During the LINER protocol, volume gains during the 30 minute sit were similar to those during OFF, but returned to baseline levels during subsequent activity. Gains in LINER during subsequent activity still remained elevated as compared to ON (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing applied pressure to the residual limb may function to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume,</b> allowing socket users to maintain a comfortable fit between limb and prosthesis. There exists a potential for development of socket technology that leverages pressure release to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim : To {{determine}} {{the value of}} fetal presentation, fetal head shape, fetal gender, estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and fetal weight estimation as diagnostic parameters - especially at 21 to 24 weeks of gestation. Moreover the calculation of reference values for the estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks. Method : Evaluation of a low risk population (20933 sonographic examinations of 13801 singleton pregnancies), recorded {{over a period of}} eight years at a gynecological ultrasound surgery. Hereby a special threedimensional measuring technique was used to estimate the amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume.</b> The fetal weight was estimated by using the Shepard&# 65533;s formula, while considering the fetal head shape. Results : Breech presentation compared with head presentation at 21 - 24 weeks of gestation was associated with a higher risk (odds ratio OR= 1, 5) of breech presentation at birth. However, fetal presentation did not become of considerable prognostic value (OR > 100) concerning birth presentation before the 33 rd week. Statistically, at the 33 rd week the "physiological" fetal movement into head presentation is completed. Estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks show a highly significant correlation with the birthweight at term (36 - 43 weeks). Measuring the fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks proved to be a more reliable value to predict high or low birthweight (at term) than the estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> method. Conclusion : While the risk of breech presentation at birth is slightly higher in fetuses showing breech presentation at 21 - 24 weeks, more than 50 % of fetuses in breech presentation by the 33 rd week move into head presentation until birth. The reliability of fetal gender diagnosis - especially at 12 - 14 weeks - speaks in favour of ultrasound as an alternative, non-invasiv way of gender-diagnostic. The estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> at 12 - 24 weeks - compared with invasive methods of determining the amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> as widely publicised in medical literature -, appears to represent the actual amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> quite accurately and therefore seems to be a useful semiquantitative method. However, estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> at 21 - 24 weeks as a single diagnostic parameter proved unsuitable for the accurate birth weight prediction of small or large for gestational age babies at term, whereas the estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks did prove to be an acceptable diagnostic test - at least for predicting very large gestational age infants...|$|R
