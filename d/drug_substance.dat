25|$|A Scanner Darkly (1977) is a bleak {{mixture of}} science fiction and police {{procedural}} novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering <b>drug,</b> <b>Substance</b> D, he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.|$|E

25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final <b>drug</b> <b>substance,</b> and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E
