5|$|About 50hours before landfall, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Belize and the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, and about 12hours later it was upgraded to a hurricane watch. When the lack of significant intensification became apparent, {{a tropical}} storm warning was added {{for much of the}} Yucatán Peninsula and later for a portion of the Mexican coast along the Bay of Campeche. As the storm approached, nearly 2,500people in vulnerable areas of eastern Mexico evacuated to safer areas. About 8,000people evacuated in Belize, primarily on offshore islands. The government of Belize opened its <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> center and evacuated several hospitals. About 250airline flights were canceled, and some cruise ship paths were diverted to safer locations.|$|E
40|$|A Field Project Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Public AdministrationThe {{problem was}} that the City of Oshkosh has not studied the impact of merging its <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with Winnebago County's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center. It is {{uncertain}} what impact merging the <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> centers would have had on the City of Oshkosh. The purpose of this field project was to identify the financial and operational impact on the City of Oshkosh if it merges its <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with the <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center of Winnebago County. The descriptive research approach was utilized to guide the following research questions: (a) What are the guidelines for maintaining an <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center within a city of comparable size to the City of Oshkosh? (b) What, if any, Wisconsin cities, similar in size to the City of Oshkosh have their own <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center, or are combined with their county's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center? (c) What, if any, process of the City of Oshkosh's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with Winnebago County's? The recommendations from the results would be: (a) to continue to have Winnebago County and the City of Oshkosh maintain separate <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> centers (b) merge the public information component along with associated responsibilities and infrastructure...|$|R

5|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the approaching hurricane in the Yucatán Peninsula were regarded as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September 2, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately. Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> centers and shelters in five cities. Mobile communication units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm's passage. Many of the nearly 35,000residents {{in and around the}} city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the storm made landfall, several Florida {{counties}} were monitoring {{the progress of the}} storm. Though no serious impact was anticipated, Brevard County officials identified possible shelters if warranted. Putnam County officials placed several shelters on standby, and utility crews in Duval County were placed on standby in the event of power failure. Several media releases of information were issued regarding the storm. The State <b>Emergency</b> <b>Operation</b> Center was on Level 2, or partial activation, and the state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to the storm. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch hours before Edouard made landfall for much of eastern Florida due to the expected rainfall from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Operation</b> Centre {{was established in}} St. John's by the Antigua & Barbuda Red Cross Society in St. John's. In the first week after the storm, 35Red Cross volunteers distributed 1,500tarpaulins, 210blankets, 300food parcels, and 30hurricane lamps to residents in the effected communities of York's, Villa, Greens Bay, Perry Bay, Piggotts, Bendals Bolans, Crab's Hill, Urlings, St. John's, and Jennings. a Red Cross office in St. Vincent de Paul also distributed rice and beans to 2,000people, while the National office of Disaster Services provided plastic sheeting and water bottles. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda dispatched teams to re-open roads, clean up debris, and restore utilities. However, after Hurricane Lenny struck the Lesser Antilles about a month later, relief efforts slowed, as many more people were significantly affected, causing recovery to be costlier.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E
5|$|On October22, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for the island of Hispaniola and {{a tropical storm}} watch for Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning. In the Dominican Republic, authorities ordered the evacuation of at least 30,000people living in areas where flooding was possible. On October22 and 23, the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall. Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October8 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire. The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of Civil Protection, the Secrétariat Permanent de Gestion des Risques et des Désastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged <b>Emergency</b> <b>Operation</b> Centres.|$|E
