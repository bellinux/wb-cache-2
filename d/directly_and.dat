5|$|Bednar has {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the Ex's public profile, and advocated for openness in communications. Food Building vendor Epic Burgers and Waffles' cronuts were tainted by Staphylococcus aureus toxin in 2013, a result of third party maple bacon jam. He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> claimed doing so would increase the fair's credibility with the public.|$|E

5|$|Besides Litvinenko, {{only two}} people left {{polonium}} trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked previously for Russian intelligence in the KGB and the GRU, respectively. They left more significant traces of polonium than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the radioactive material <b>directly,</b> <b>and</b> did not ingest it.|$|E
5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} offer a {{range of}} volunteer-led programming, usually focusing on anthropomorphic art, crafts, music and literature. Some raise money for charity.

5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E

5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E
5|$|Martin also <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> {{indirectly}} {{contributed to}} the main themes of three films in the James Bond series.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E
5|$|The Clear Lake Area {{includes}} numerous {{communities and}} municipalities surrounding Clear Lake between Pasadena, Houston, and the bay.Barrington (2008), p. 225–235.Abbott (2003), p. 23 This area largely owes its recent growth and prosperity <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> indirectly to the Johnson Space Center, {{and has been}} traditionally characterized by a large white collar workforce and its prolific middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods. The area is sometimes seen as {{the heart of the}} Bay Area in spite of the relative youth of its history.|$|E
5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E

5|$|The {{status quo}} {{is no longer an}} option and there is an unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> deeply {{involved}} in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E
