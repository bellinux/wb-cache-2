In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to <b>earlier</b> works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to <b>earlier</b> work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his <b>earlier</b> work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music.|$|E
