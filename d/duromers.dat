40|$|Porous, polymer derived SiCN {{ceramics}} are synthesized from a solid polysilazane (PSZMS) and an ultra-high {{molecular weight}} polyethylene (PE) as sacrificial filler. Common analytical methods {{for the investigation}} of the thermal decomposition processes and the formed (macro) porosities, such as thermogravimetry and mercury porosimetry respectively, were supplemented by micro computed tomography (-CT) measurements. Due to its non-destructive nature, this method enables the comparative analysis of both, the in the first step formed preceramic <b>duromers,</b> to distinguish between the different polymers, as well as the resulting porous ceramics. The via -CT determined values for the two polymer phases after cross-linking are in a good agreement with the used original amounts of PE and PSZMS. In contrast the values for the porosity resulting from the PE filler and for the formed SiCN ceramic after pyrolysis differ in greater extent due to the limiting resolution that can be achiev ed by applying -CT measurements...|$|E

40|$|The Chip in <b>Duromer</b> {{technology}} for realization of stackable SIPs, {{is similar to}} conventional Molded Interconnect Device (MID) technology, that is usually realized using thermoplastic polymers, combining the functionality of housing and substrate into one device. Advantages of the conventional MID technology are the reduction of parts during assembly by integrating mechanical and electrical functionality into a device and the reduction of space, as MID allows a 3 D integration of devices. Disadvantage of conventional technology, especially if combined with typical technical thermoplastics is the large mismatch in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between substrate and advanced microelectronic components as CSP or flip chip. This is reducing the applicability of thermoplastic MID to moderate temperature ranges and/or to rather robust components. To overcome this disadvantage the use of low CTE <b>Duromer</b> as Epoxy Molding Compounds (EMC) as base material for device assembly is proposed, generating a unique technology well adapted to SIP and MEMS packaging needs, the <b>Duromer</b> MID approach. The technological realization of Chip in <b>Duromer</b> uses equipment involved are conventional backend processes as IC bonding to Flex, transfer molding using epoxy molding compounds, laser machining, metallization and structurization processes well known from PCB processing. The use of existing equipment allows both, a rather fast process implementation and a cost effective manufacturing of the components.

40|$|With a monofunktional epoxy {{compound}} the reaction behaviour of cold curing epoxy resins was simulated and then investigated with {{thin layer chromatography}} (TLC). The monomer reaction products allow mass- and NMR-spectroskopical analyses which show that only secondary Beta-aminoalcohols are formed. The model epoxy reacts with primary amines in three steps due to the different nucleophilicity of each functional group. This fact directly leads to postcuring epoxy hot-melts. At room temperature a thermoplastic polymer with adhesional properties is formed, which can be post-cured at higher temperatures into a <b>duromer</b> resin...|$|R
40|$|Thermoplastic {{packaging}} materials have some advantages over duromers: shorter cycletimes, automisation easier, ecological favourable. Moreover the bond strength packaging material - leadframe is higher {{and can be}} further increased by a pretreatment of the leadframe. The bond strength after aging and the diffusion of water along the interface are comparable for thermoplast and <b>duromer.</b> The injection molding parameters have to be modified {{in order to ensure}} good wetting.

40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} number of mobile electronic products such as mobile communicators, combining the functions of a mobile phone and a PDA are beginning to emerge. These devices are highly miniaturized and yet provide a variety of functions at ever higher speeds. Additionally, the product cycle time is getting faster, requiring short design and production cycles at ever lower cost. These trends are posing great set of challenges for the microelectronics and packaging and assembly industry. There seem to be two approaches to solve these challenges-system-in-package (SIP) by stacking of packaged integrated circuits (ICs) or system-on-package (SOP) by stacking of packages with embedded active and passive components. The buried components in SOP require significantly less space in the Z direction, thereby allowing the formation of three-dimensional (3 -D) stackable packages. In this paper, two approaches for stacking SOPs were presented, the so-called chip-in-polymer (CIP) technology and <b>duromer</b> molded interconnect device (MID) /WLP technology...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the general}} trends in {{microelectronics}} packaging is the constant miniaturization of devices. This {{has led to the}} development of maximums miniaturization of components on Si level, i. e. CSPs and Flip Chips. To further integrate more functionality into devices, and to further increase the degree of miniaturization, packaging development focus is switching from single chip packaging top the realization of systems in package, SiPs. Two main approaches do exist to realize this goal, one is to integrate all components into one dedicated package, yielding maximum miniaturization for a special application, but little flexibility as far as system design is concerned. The other is to create modular stackable components, that can be assembled into a functional system. This integrates both, flexibility in system design by exchangeable components and increased reliability potential, as single components can be tested separately. This last approach was considered a promising choice for the generation of SIPs. Within this paper a packaging process is introduced, that allows the wafer level manufacturing of stackable, encapsulated devices. Using a transfer molded epoxy demonstrator a proof-of-concept is performed, showing the feasibility of the stackable package approach. This is achieved by combining wafer level encapsulation and molded interconnect device technology. An electroless process for metallization and laser techniques for structuring the metallization layer have been applied to generate structures for reliable interconnects capable for the use of lead-free solders. Summarized this paper presents the process development and feasibility analysis of wafer level packaging technologies for modular SiP solutions based on a <b>duromer</b> MID approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the project based on nanotechnological concepts, {{multifunctional}} host/guest systems ('nanomodules') were developed for the fabrication of polymer systems like adhesives, coatings or matrix resins for reinforced composites. For this purpose, nanoscale inorganic particles with adjustable hollows or tailored surfaces were manufactured which were used as hosts for curing reagents and were dispersed in one-component (1 -c) reactive epoxy (EP) resins. According to the state of technology, such reactive formulations are basically composed of five ingredients, namely EP resins, hardeners, accelerators, fillers, and additives. In hot-curing 1 -c EP systems latent hardeners are used which can be activated thermally. Being among the currently most established accelerators, a derivative a urea (a urone) and a tertiary amine were used as benchmark systems. Besides the polyaddition reaction between resin and hardener, accelerators may also initiate the EP homopolymerisation. Thus, for achieving a shelf life ol several months any network formation reaction at storage temperature has to be prevented. Nevertheless, the required <b>duromer</b> formation was intended to be adjusted at temperatures which are clearly below a curing temperature of typically 150 deg C which represents the currently feasible state of technology. Additionally, the thermomechanical properties of the composites were intended not lo be negatively influenced. In the project this technical problem was solved by profiting from the vastly inert behaviour of encapsulated active agents at room temperature and by thermally triggering the release using a tailored process inducing the rtigh-temperature network formation. Two basic reactive formulations were investigated, namely a highly viscous dicyandiamide (DIC' 0 curing and a lowly viscous anhydride curing EP system. Three distinct types of nanoscale host systems were applied which are commercially available, partly owing to the project. These host systems comprise nano-zeolites. organophilic layered silicates ('organoclays') and organosilane monolayers on nanoparticles based on pyrogenic silica. The design of such nanomodules was supported by computer based simulation methods effective on a molecular level (force field methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo methods). Thus relating structures and effects, directed optimisations of synthesis processes were attainable. Applying and optimising immobilisation procedures developed in the project, nanomodules became available in amounts of kilograms, e g. when based on pyrogenic silica. Iterative optimisations of the reactive formulations were facilitated by developing a method and procedure for determining the shelf life of reactive mixtures at elevated temperatures with a high time-resolution of some minutes. Uecfianistic insight resulting from experimental investigations revealed that curing agents released from nanomodules can contribute in the dissolution of DICY crystallites. Technologically applicable and well dispersible nanomodules facilitated the following combinations of properties of nanocomposites which resulted advantageous for distinct applications. As compared to a reactive formulation using the benchmark accelerator, which exhibits a shelf life of four months at room temperature - measurable by viscometry - and a curing temperature of 150 deg C, the corresponding formulation based on a multiply encapsulated accelerator within a nanomodule with complex structure is characterised by a significantly lower curing temperature of 136 deg C and the same shelf life. Protective coatings based on organoclays exhibit good barrier and corrosion protection properties under atmospherical and thermal exposures. A n a no module-filled reactive formulation for coating systems which is based on organoclays and stable for storage at room temperature is available in amounts of kilograms. Used as accelerators in storage-stable reactive epoxy formulations, the nanomodules developed within the project can contribute in decreasing the presently prevailing curing temperatures and, thus, in facilitating more energy efficient fabrication processes and the application of thermally sensitive materials for light weight structures...|$|R
