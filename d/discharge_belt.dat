40|$|Abstract: The {{rigidity}} of {{the principal}} axis of a CNC vertical boring-milling machine was analyzed, and the belt tension and end deformation were also calculated. A project was proposed to improve the structure {{of the principal}} axis for finish machining. After the <b>discharge</b> <b>belt</b> pulley was applied on the principal axis, the force transmission and the rigidity of principal axle system were improved considerably. The design and process means were proposed for the three added parts of the improved structure. The improved structure is simplified, secure and low-cost. The machining precision was increased, and the fixing was also become convenient...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper will}} {{demonstrate}} how automated fragmentation photo analysis {{is being used}} at the Lafarge North America, Ravena NY quarry {{as part of an}} ongoing drill, blast and primary crushing continuous improvement process. Using on-line fragmentation photo analysis systems at both the primary crusher feed point and crusher <b>discharge</b> <b>belt,</b> data is collected to: benchmark the drill/blast process; monitor the work being done by the primary crusher; measure gradation changes in the crusher feed resulting from changes in drill/blast and measure the subsequent changes in further size reduction done by the primary crusher. Explanation will be given to: the ongoing drill, blast and primary crusher continuous improvement process; the objectives and methodology for their refinement; determination of the benchmarks for the drill/blast fragmentation based on crusher type and operational settings; the guidelines and rationale used for choosing methods, techniques and equipment for data collection; and finally benefits realized from the implementation of the on-line photo analysis system. Discussion will be given to how the data is systematically organized and correlated not only to compare to benchmarks and measure improvement but to build a high level of understanding that ultimately supports decisions for improvement. The paper will provide templates presenting data at different steps of the process and a template for the dashboard that is the decision supporting informatio...|$|E

40|$|Planting trees {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as part of the}} solution to dryland salinity in Australia. The best location in the landscape and the spatial arrangement of trees however, is difficult to determine. This paper presents a case study of a field experiment that compared the water use of tree belts with that of pastures in recharge and discharge areas of a first order catchment in the Central West of NSW, Australia. The recharge tree belt and both pasture sites used very similar amounts of water but the <b>discharge</b> tree <b>belt</b> used double the water of the other three land uses by accessing groundwater. The <b>discharge</b> tree <b>belt</b> operated in an energy-limited environment, transpiring at a rate equivalent to atmospheric demand whereas the other three land uses were all water-limited. From a land management point of view, the establishment of more trees on the discharge site would have the biggest impact on reducing saline discharge and the least impact on the agricultural operations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{design of}} conveyor transfers for the efficient transfer of product from one conveyor to another {{is of utmost}} importance and companies can not afford a hit and miss approach in their construction. Several key particle mechanisms occur within a transfer chute, <b>discharge</b> from a <b>belt</b> conveyor, trajectory, impact, free-fall and chute flow. This paper {{will focus on the}} prediction of product discharge and product trajectory from conveyor belts, which are the defining elements determining the flow through a conveyor transfer. There are several approaches available in the literature which will be reviewed taking into account issues such as the parameters used in the trajectory determination, complexity of method and potential accuracy. Following this review, trajectory curves for a range of belt velocities and pulley diameters will be generated to allow visual scrutiny of each method and to better compare one method to another...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1900 s, {{numerical}} {{methods have been}} used to predict the trajectory of material <b>discharged</b> from a <b>belt</b> conveyor. These methods range from the very basic to complex iterative approaches. Some methods predict similar paths and others vary noticeably, however it is clear that they cannot all be correct. The discrete element method (DEM) is also becoming more widely accepted as a design tool, however, hesitation still exists in some quarters stemming from the lack of experimental validation available. A conveyor transfer research facility has been commissioned at the University of Wollongong to experimentally investigate particle flow mechanisms through a variety of conveyor transfers. As part of this research, preliminary investigations into conveyor trajectories have been undertaken at varying belt speeds and material flow rates using granular polyethylene pellets. This paper presents the trajectory results of an experimental test program and compares these findings with numerous numerical trajectory methods as well as DEM simulations in an attempt to validate the predictive approaches available to generate conveyor trajectories. Early findings suggest the method of Booth provided the most accurate prediction, while the DEM also compares favourably to the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{resources in}} the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (northeast Italy) are an important natural resource in terms of quantity, quality and ease of supply. This optimal condition, however, has long believed that it allowed an irrational and uncontrolled exploitation of it. This inevitably produced tangible consequences on {{the quantity and quality}} of water resources available in our area. Although the situation on a global scale can be regarded as not yet alarming, even if are increasingly frequent reports on water pollution and more obvious indicators of the progressive depletion of underground water reserves. Since ten years ago, there is a lowering in groundwater levels in the Upper Plain and a loss of pressure in Low Plain confined aquifers. These phenomena are accompanied by the gradual amplitude range reduction of Resurgence belt, resulting in decrease in the amount of available water to the naturalness of the lowlands, its impact on ecosystems and related loss of traditional habitats such as wet meadows. In light of this, it is easy to predict that, unless appropriate measures will be implemented at a regional level, the intense human pressure will cause the persistence, if not the increase, of the just described phenomena. It is indisputable in fact that the flow rates derived for hydroelectric and irrigation uses and well withdrawals for domestic, drinking, industrial, irrigation, fishing industry and geothermal purposes, have created a change in the normal cycle of water, in the natural drainage ways and in the residence time for groundwater. On one side, the derived discharge rates in mountain basins are returned to the valley only after the intersection with the Resurgence belt producing a decline in the active recharge of the High Plain. On the other side, well withdrawals dissolve a significant amount of water resource and constitute now the most important forced element for the groundwater flow. Well withdrawals, moreover, are currently the only reliable and predictable outflow from the aquifer systems: are missing, in fact, evidences of substantial losses to the sea, both along the coast and at some distance from the coast, while at the state of knowledge, are difficult to evaluate the shares with the groundwater adjacent regional hydrogeological basins. By using a purposefully oversimplified conceptual model, the presence of the Resurgence belt appears to be produced by a kind of groundwater "overflow" for the regional plain. The studied territory can be considered as a "semi-closed box" in which the pouring into the sea and underground interchange with the adjacent domains are not relevant and recharging groundwater is mainly due to the dispersion of runoff water, infiltration, rainfall and irrigation practices incident on the High Plain. According to these assumptions, the Resurgence belt drains an average quantity of water equal to the active recharge from the High Plain subtracting the magnitude of well withdrawals from the confined aquifer systems in the lowlands. Withdrawal entity, Resurgence <b>belt</b> <b>discharge,</b> freatimetric levels in the Upper Plain and confined aquifers pressure in the Low Plain are closely interdependent and in dynamic balance. According to this schematization, the Resurgence <b>belt</b> <b>discharge</b> is an indirect indicator of the withdrawal magnitude and its sustainability. Although even if it still represents a surplus of the active recharge to the aquifer systems in the Low Plain, the assessment of water use sustainability, or the maximum allowable amount of groundwater withdrawals can not be reduced to a mere quantification of the instream flow to assigne to the discharge of the Resurgence belt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} seven material discharge trajectory {{methods and}} explains {{the differences between}} them. Most of these methods involve a series of equations to determine first whether low-speed or high-speed conveying condition apply, then the material discharge angle for low-speed conditions and finally the X and Y coordinates of the trajectory profile. There are also simplified methods which rely on graphical determination of the trajectory profiles. The methods have been analysed to investigate which included parameters can be declared as variables for a given conveying condition and then evaluated to determine {{the impact of the}} variations. These parameters include, adhesive stress, coefficients of static and kinetic friction, air drag, particle shape and size, divergent coefficients and material bulk density.

40|$|AbstractAs {{environmental}} regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal practices are increasingly {{more important in}} all types of aquaculture. In many recirculation systems, microscreen filters are used to remove and concentrate the suspended solids from the process water, because they require minimal labor and floor space and can treat large flow rates of water with little head loss. These microscreen filters generate a separate solids waste stream that can be further concentrated to reduce the quantity and {{improve the quality of}} <b>discharge</b> water. A <b>Belt</b> Filter System, Hydrotech Model HBF 537 - 1 H, from Waste Management Technologies Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, USA was evaluated for rapid thickening of sludge from the backwash water of a microscreen filter. When used in conjunction with coagulation/flocculation aids, significant reduction of suspended solid and phosphorus are possible. Testing of the system was conducted using the backwash effluent of a microscreen filter that treated water discharged from several large-scale recirculating aquaculture production systems growing artic char and trout. The system was tested using only alum as the coagulant aid, using only a commercially available polymer as the flocculation aid and the two coagulation/flocculation aids in combination. Alum alone was moderately efficient in removing solids (82 %), but was very efficient in sequestering reactive phosphorus (96 %), with effluent concentrations less than 0. 07 mg/L-P at the highest alum dosage tested, 100 mg/L. Several commercially available polymers used alone and at relatively low dosages (15 mg/L) were very effective in removing suspended solids, with a removal rate averaging 96 % and with an effluent TSS concentration of less than 30 mg/L. The polymers were not as efficient as alum in removing reactive phosphorus, with a removal rate of approximately 40 %. At the optimum combined dosage of alum (mg/L) and polymer (mg/L), the Inclined Belt Filter System increased the dry matter content of the sludge to approximately 13 % solids, and reduced both the suspended solids and reactive phosphorus concentration of the effluent by 95 and 80 %, respectively. The combination of coagulation/flocculation aids and the inclined belt filter show excellent potential to greatly reduce the volume of solids generated, and significantly reduce the concentration of suspended solids and phosphorus in discharged effluents. By eliminating the need for settling tanks or ponds, the leaching of nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) is minimized and the dewatered sludge is in a form for easy transport, storage, or disposal...|$|R
