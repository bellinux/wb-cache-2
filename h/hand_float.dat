50|$|In 1814, Frederic Tudor {{began to}} {{establish}} {{markets in the}} West Indies and the southern United States for ice. In 1826, Rufus Page built the first large ice house near Gardiner to supply Tudor. The ice was harvested by farmers and others who were inactive due to the winter weather. The ice was cut by <b>hand,</b> <b>floated</b> to an ice house on the bank, and stored until spring. Then, packed in sawdust, it was loaded aboard ships and sent south.|$|R

50|$|The {{scouring}} of {{the floating}} coat {{is of great}} importance, for it consolidates the material, and, besides hardening it, prevents it from cracking. It {{is done by the}} plasterer with a <b>hand</b> <b>float</b> that he applies vigorously with a rapid circular motion, at the same time sprinkling the work with water from a stock brush in the other hand. Any small holes or inequalities are filled up as he proceeds. The whole surface should be uniformly scoured two or three times, with an interval between each operation of from six to twenty-four hours. This process leaves the plaster with a close-grained and fairly smooth surface, offering little or no key to the coat that is to follow.|$|E
5000|$|Plaster {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a <b>hand</b> <b>float</b> to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based plaster can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most plaster sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed plaster packaged in a plastic bag because the plaster spraying machine {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that plaster is kept moist. The pre-mixed plaster also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the plaster from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed plaster can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|E
50|$|The Kendesnii {{campground}} on the Nabesna Road is {{the only}} Park Service-managed campground in the park. There {{are a number of}} private campgrounds and lodgings on the McCarthy and Nabesna roads, and there are fourteen public-use cabins. Most of these cabins are accessible only by air. A few are accessible by road near the Slana Ranger Station, and most are associated with airstrips. Backcountry camping is allowed without a permit. There are few established and maintained trails in the park. Mountain biking is mainly limited to roads due to prevailing boggy conditions in the summer. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>float</b> trips on the rivers are a popular way to see the park on the Copper, Nizina, Kennicott and Chitina rivers. Because the park and preserve include some of the highest peaks in North America, they are a popular destination for mountain climbing. Of the 70 tallest mountains in Alaska, 35 are in the park, including seven of the top ten peaks. Climbing these peaks is technically demanding, and requires expeditions to access remote and dangerous terrain.|$|E

The simplest form of rotary processing is to use one tube per film; no extra reel or complex film-holding device is needed. The film is loaded, solution added, tube closed, and the tube is spun, by <b>hand,</b> <b>floating</b> in a water bath. The direction of spin is normally reversed {{after a couple of}} spins.

H 577 P ITC 2017 LiuSxxi, 172 pages :color illustrationsThe {{research}} {{progress made}} {{in the field of}} materials science and the efforts put forth by many researchers have resulted in many research works that focus on wearable electronic textiles. Nowadays, wearable electronic textiles have progressed from the research lab into the industry and subsequently commercialized. The different ways of incorporating conductive fibers and electronic components into traditional textiles have been receiving much attention due to the potentially significant commercial value. However, the industry {{does not appear to have}} the means to new knowledge and knowledge transfer. For example, the industry does not have the resources to calculate and control yarn resistance on fabrics simply based on current textile knowledge, and wearable electronic products thus cannot be further developed. Nevertheless, the results of research on such products are not significant or adequate due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary efforts required for their success. Therefore, there is a need to establish a systematic method to provide the industry with a reference source to produce wearable electronics. The relationship between different stitches and the properties of conductive materials needs to be elaborated. This study conducts a series of experiments on the resistivity of conductive knitted fabric with different knitwear structures. Based on a previous study that modeled the resistance of plain jersey fabric with different numbers of wales and courses, planar geometric models are established for 1 x n float and Single Pique structures. Resistive network models are developed for different external voltages to determine the resistance values of conductive knitted fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed models. The simulated results obtained through modeling agree well with the experimental data with an acceptable range of error. Finally, a comparison of jersey (knit), float and tuck stitches is carried out with the relative wales and courses. It is concluded that both float and tuck stitches could reduce the total resistance of conductive knitted fabrics, and between them, tuck structures can provide lower resistance as well as a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>float</b> structures are more economical, as conductive yarn is expensive so its cost is reduced with use of float stitch as the loop length is much shorter than that of the tuck stitches. Three thermal knitwear garments are developed in the experiments to test the thermal performance to determine the optimal design from the different knitted structures. It is concluded that the thermal properties are influenced by the different knitted structures and Single Pique has the most optimal performance in terms of the heating effect among the three types of selected structures. The newly developed resistance models in this study will provide significant benefits to the commercialization of wearable electronic textiles, as well as to the apparel industry as they can now offer apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rates are always preferred when prices are set in consumers' currencies because floating exchange rates allow domestic consumption to be insulated from foreign monetary shocks.

In some respects the frost was an advantage, for it hardened the roads, that were before often almost impassable from the amount of heavy traffic that had passed over them. But, upon the other <b>hand,</b> <b>floating</b> masses of ice speedily covered the rivers, rendering the work of fording them painful and difficult in the extreme. A Russian division had, on the 3rd, pressed hotly on the retreating column just as they reached the Wiazma river. A sanguinary conflict took place, the corps of the Viceroy passed through the town on its banks, and crossed the river in fair order, but that of Davoust broke and crossed in great confusion, covered by Ney's division, which retreated steadily, facing about from time to time, and repulsing the infantry attacks, but suffering heavily from the artillery. Ney set the town on fire to cover his retreat, crossed the bridges, and there stemmed the further advance of the Russians.|$|R
