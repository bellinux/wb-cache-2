25|$|The {{links between}} the two nations remains strong, and the fact that for the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further {{strengthens}} the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main turistic destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sphere}} of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated {{during the war and}} had been largely {{agricultural}} since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the European Union and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the {{economics}} of railroading began to change. With {{the advent of the}} internal combustion engine, trains slowly began to lose their advantage as a transportation option. Automobiles and trucks began to increase in popularity as highways improved, siphoning ridership and freight traffic off railroads. The advent of the Interstate Highway System tipped the <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> by increasing mobility as factories and offices were now able to be located further away from the fixed routes of the railroads. The decline in both passenger and freight traffic occurred at a point when the B, like most other railroads, had just switched over to diesel locomotives, meaning that they had large debts. The pressure from the debts and the large infrastructure costs associated with operating a disparate passenger and freight network amongst declining traffic forced the B to cut costs. The most noticeable effect to the general public was the reductions in passenger operation. In the late 1950s the B began to eliminate routes and substituted Multi-Unit diesel-powered passenger cars on many of its routes. The effort did not succeed, as the B was bankrupt by 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{a careful}} <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> was reached, {{as most of}} the {{remaining}} white rural community eked out pleasant existence as subsistence growers, selling their surplus crop to the local towns and plantations along the Tidewater, and working part-time on the plantations and in the towns for additional income and a place in society.

40|$|What {{has been}} the {{reaction}} of Kazakhstan toward the rising power and influence of Russia since 1994 ? This paper uses the concept of soft-balancing, specifically analyzing economic issues using Stephen Walt's balance of threats approach, {{in an analysis of}} Kazakhstan's relationship with Russia. It examines instances of Kazakhstan's internal and external <b>economic</b> soft <b>balancing</b> efforts vis-à-vis Russia to explain how it used economic tools to protect its energy security from Russia. After 1991, which marked the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union – the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), including Kazakhstan, needed to create an institution that could tackle economic and energy problems in the region. I argue that the Eurasian Union idea promoted by the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was a skillful attempt to simultaneously maintain a close cooperation with Russia and to soft balance against Russia's influence through collaboration with other CIS countries. However, that initiative failed and did not have the intended <b>economic</b> soft <b>balancing</b> effect. When Russia started asserting its economic and political power over the Central Asian and Caspian regions, Nazarbayev once again resorted to the <b>economic</b> soft <b>balancing</b> policy, but this time by relying on outside players. Part 2 of this article discusses two cases of such external <b>economic</b> soft <b>balancing</b> efforts: participation in the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project, and the economic cooperation with Turkey as part of a free trade zone. The BTC pipeline project and the close economic cooperation with Turkey ended up being a more productive soft balancing effort than the earlier Eurasian Union initiative...|$|R
