30|$|As {{the cases}} above illustrate, {{electronic}} collimation {{has the potential}} to mask patient information included on the image. Electronic collimation may be used to optimise contrast and suppress noise in the region of interest, but an image with the original field size should always be sent to the PACS. This does not only count for manual electronic collimation but also in case of automatic removal of the background, as use of such software carries the inherent risk of inaccurate alignment of the <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> and the exposure field.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon flash units {{to be used}} at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for focal-plane shutters fire several times as the slit moves across the film. <b>Electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.|$|R

50|$|On most film cameras {{the shutter}} angle is changed by {{removing}} the lens and adjusting the shutter with a special tool. This cannot be done while the camera is operating. Some cameras such as the Arriflex 435ES can modify their shutter angle during the shot. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter.</b> An <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> can compensate for the exposure change caused by a speed ramp without changing the aperture and affecting depth of field.|$|E
50|$|Today, most {{digital cameras}} use {{combination}} of mechanical shutter and <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> or mechanical shutter solely. Mechanical shutter can accommodate up to 1/16000 seconds (for example the Minolta Dynax/Maxxum/α-9 film camera had {{a maximum of}} 1/12000, a record in its era, and the later digital Nikon D1 series were capable of 1/16000), while <b>electronic</b> <b>shutter</b> can accommodate at least 1/32000 seconds, used for many superzoom cameras and currently many Fujifilm APS-C cameras (X-Pro2, X-T1, X100T and others).|$|E

5000|$|The last {{development}} of M42 lenses was {{the introduction of}} a link between camera and lens to transmit the lens aperture setting, which allowed light metering with the aperture remaining wide open. The means of doing this was not standardised, Praktica's method was to use an electrical connection which transmitted a variable resistance value to the camera's metering circuit. Asahi Pentax developed an additional lever on the lens which operated a variable resistor in the camera mount. These mechanisms spurred the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> linked to the metering circuit, allowing for automated shutter speed selection by the camera (aperture priority). M42 cameras with wide open metering facility include: ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{objectives}} of the imaging experiment on the Viking Orbiter are to aid the selection of Viking Lander sites, to map and monitor the chosen sites during lander operations, {{to aid in the}} selection of future landing sites, and to extend our knowledge of the planet. The imaging system consists of two identical vidicon cameras each attached to a 1026 -mm T/ 8 telescope giving approximately 1 -deg square field of view. From an altitude of 1500 km, the picture elements will be approximately 24 m apart. The vidicon is coupled with an image intensifier which provides increased sensitivity and permits <b>electronic</b> <b>shuttering</b> and image motion compensation.

40|$|A device {{built around}} a pair of <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> has been {{demonstrated}} to be effective as a prototype of stroboscopic goggles or eyeglasses for preventing or reducing motion sickness. The momentary opening of the shutters helps to suppress a phenomenon that is known in the art as retinal slip and is described more fully below. While {{a number of different}} environmental factors can induce motion sickness, a common factor associated with every known motion environment is sensory confusion or sensory mismatch. Motion sickness is a product of misinformation arriving at a central point in the nervous system from the senses from which one determines one s spatial orientation. When information from the eyes, ears, joints, and pressure receptors are all in agreement as to one s orientation, there is no motion sickness. When one or more sensory input(s) to the brain is not expected, or conflicts with what is anticipated, the end product is motion sickness. Normally, an observer s eye moves, compensating for the anticipated effect of motion, in such a manner that the image of an object moving relatively to an observer is held stationary on the retina. In almost every known environment that induces motion sickness, a change in the gain (in the signal-processing sense of gain) of the vestibular system causes the motion of the eye to fail to hold images stationary on the retina, and the resulting motion of the images is termed retinal slip. The present concept of stroboscopic goggles or eyeglasses (see figure) is based on the proposition that prevention of retinal slip, and hence, the prevention of sensory mismatch, can be expected to reduce the tendency toward motion sickness. A device according to this concept helps to prevent retinal slip by providing snapshots of the visual environment through <b>electronic</b> <b>shutters</b> that are brief enough that each snapshot freezes the image on each retina. The exposure time for each snapshot is less than 5 ms. In the event that a higher rate of strobing is necessary for adequate viewing of the changing scene during rapid head movements, the rate of strobing (but not the exposure time) can be controlled in response to the readings of rate-of-rotation sensors attached to the device...|$|R
