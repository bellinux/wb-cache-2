During this process, the individual polymer chains tend to somewhat align because of viscous flow. These filaments still have an amorphous structure, so they are drawn to align the fibers further, thus increasing crystallinity, tensile strength and stiffness.

50|$|A <b>draw</b> <b>twister</b> is {{a machine}} used to draw and twist large {{quantities}} of polymer fibers. It uses two sets of rollers, where the second set rotates faster than the first, thus drawing the fiber between them. While the fibers are being drawn they are also twisted into thread.|$|E
