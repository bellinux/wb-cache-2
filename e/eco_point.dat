It is about 6 km from Robertsganj, and hundred meters from Veer Lorik Stone, on Markundi Hill. <b>Eco</b> <b>Point</b> Robertsganj was inaugurated on 11 August 2003 by the District Magistrate of Sonbhadra. The place is thronged by tourists during the monsoon season as it provides a very beautiful and picturesque view of the valley, including small rainy waterfalls that mushroom during the season. A small restaurant close by provides fast food items. Son View Point is a great picnic spot for the nature lovers.|$|E

40|$|Toxicity, energy {{consumption}} and economical effects of applying SnPb 37 solder and PCB finish, SnAg 3. 0 Cu 0. 5 solder, SnCu 0. 75 solder, SnZn 9 solder and Sn {{as well as}} Ni/Au PCB finishes were compared to the respective tin-lead soldering materials. All assessed lead-free materials, besides the Ni/Au PCB finish, considerably reduce the toxic releases from PCBs into the environment. Lead-free soldering with SnAgCu and SnCu solders and current equipment increases the {{energy consumption}} in reflow soldering. To a minor degree it also enhances the energy demand for metal production. The energy consumption of the reflow oven is an environmental hot spot in the life cycle. The situation will improve with already available new oven technology. Evaluation with the Eco Indicator 95 and the <b>Eco</b> <b>Point</b> method show, that lead-free soldering with current soldering equipment and with the assessed lead-free solders and the tin PCB finish considerably reduces the overall burden to the environment. Surplus energy cost and, especially in case of SnAgCu solder, increased solder cost will hardly affect {{the total cost of}} a PCB, as solder and energy cost are only a minor part of the total PCB cost.

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} concrete pipes is an energy intensive process, leading to a high energy consumption, and {{to a lot of}} noise, vibration, and dust. This is to a large extent {{due to the fact that}} the concrete has to be compacted by vibration needles, or even by centrifugal techniques. Considering the new technology of self-compacting concrete, the working conditions in the factory can significantly be improved, and a lower energy consumption can be obtained. This paper tries to quantifiy the ecological profit when a concrete pipe factory is shifting its production to self-compacting concrete technology. Information on reduction of noise and vibration is given. The service life of the moulds will be increased.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of interpretation; especially with the role of the reader and his freedom. Is the reader free to make any interpretation he wants, or are there some restrictions? Contemporary philosophy views reader free from any restrictions; the reader is the one who gives meaning to texts and it seems the only one. But U. <b>Eco</b> <b>points</b> out that in that way the text itself is forgotten. VVolfgang Iser sees reading as a game, in which not only the text is played, but the reader too. For Eco text which plays with the reader is open text. Open text creates the model reader for itself and rejects bad interpretations. And the methods which are suggested by Eco and Iser, can help you only to discover bad interpretations, they cannot show the best one or better one from several good interpretations. Restrictions to interpretation do not mean that there are only few ways to interpret the text, Eco says that possibilities of interpretation are virtually infinite. Another im-portant thing mentioned is that language in Eco's view (not only for Eco) is dynamic by itself and it abvays changes, so no theory about it can be globai; thus the theory of interpretation cannot give strict rules for interpreting texts too. There is abvays freedom for creativity, just not forget-ting the text which is interpreted. The main idea of the article can be summarised by these Eco's words: "Thus every act of reading is a difficult transaction between the competence of the reader (the reader's world knowledge) and the kind of competence that a given texts postulates in order to be read in an economic way"...|$|R
40|$|The {{backdrop}} of global deforestation and environmental degradation compelled the critics {{to change their}} angles of vision and examine the works of art differently. As a result, Eco criticism emerged as a new literary field in the 1990 s. It investigates human's relation with the nature presented in literature. In this respect, many Eco critical works written by Romanticists led to the negligence {{of the importance of}} environmental concern in 17 th and 18 th English literature. Andrew Marvell, although being neglected, advocated for the preservation of Nature way back in the 17 th century. He pleaded with human being to elevate their relationship with everything in nature to a higher level of feeling. Thus, this paper aims at delving into Marvell’s selected poems to explore them from an <b>Eco</b> critical <b>point</b> of view so as to consider Marvell an Ecocritical poet...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{classical}} studies {{has undergone a}} radical transformation {{with the arrival of}} the digital age, particularly with regard to the editing of ancient texts. As Umberto <b>Eco</b> (2003) <b>pointed</b> out, the digital age may mean the end of the history of variants and of the notion of the "original text. " Among the texts of antiquity, the editing of Homer and of the New Testament are more especially susceptible to the effects of digital technology because of their numerous manuscripts. Whereas the "Homer Multitext" project recognizes that the notion of a synthetic critical edition is now seriously brought into question, the prototype of the online Greek New Testament continues to be based on the aim of obtaining a unique text, in the style of a printed critical edition. As it moves from a printed culture to the digital age, the editing of the Greek NT is also confronted by the emergence of non-Western scholarship. For example, the presence is to be noted of Arabic Muslim websites that examine Greek New Testament manuscripts but without directly interacting with Western scholarship...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid-eighties Austria has {{attempted}} to slow the growth in trans-boundary trucking. The number of trucking permits which is regulated in bilateral treaties (quotas) is increased only slowly, the permitted number of transit trips of trucks registered in Austria and in the EU was capped at the 1991 level in Austria's transit treaty with the EU. This change in road transport policy already {{can be seen in}} the statistics of trans-boundary trucking. While the volume of shipments increased by an average of 3 percent p. a., the number of road trips has remained constant for the last five years. As a result rail transport gained significant market shares. Austria's restrictive quota policy with respect to trucking permits has already caused occasional capacity bottlenecks. It is expected that the EU internal market and the opening up of reform countries will lead to a significant increase in international commodity transport in Austria. This will lead to an increasing shortage in road transport quotas (bilateral permits, <b>eco</b> <b>points).</b> They will be in high demand by trucking firms, since transport rates will increase as a result of scarce supply. In the past permits have been distributed free of charge according to the "established interest" rule: firms which already in the past had carried out regular transport activities to or through the respective partner countries have received priority treatment. When firms change hands, transport permits are transferred to the new owner. This practice leads to the result that these "quasi-automatic permits" play a major role in the valuation of trucking firms. In this way the road transport business has come to be dominated by a number of firms which have been in the business for a long time. It was nearly impossible for new dynamic firms to enter the market. In general, this lack of competition leads to low efficiency. One way to determine who is the most efficient user of a permit would be to auction off the permits. A firm which expects to obtain higher profit from a permit than its competitors would be willing to offer a higher price. The auction mechanism could be a uniform price procedure with the rent going to the public hand. These auction revenues could be used to finance measures to reduce environmental damages caused by trucks.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} novel Se um viajante numa noite de inverno (1979). This work was {{originally}} published in Italy in 1979 by Italo Calvino. Our study is based {{in the light of the}} theoretical framework proposed by the semiotician Umberto Eco, especially from his work Interpretation and Overinterpretation (2001). Assuming that the narrative construction of the reffered 'hyper-novel' of Calvin, we can be approximated to the theory advocated by <b>Eco,</b> the main <b>point</b> of contact between these seemingly distinct authors is in fact that both dedicated themselves to think, incisively the question of the interpretation of literary texts. Thus, the process of the making of the groundbreaking novel Calvin was attractive for further study of the work from a critical analysis and interpretation of the interpretation of the work of these prominent authors. Through the contrast of these books is noticed, especially in the work of Calvin that his main objective was to conduct a review of literature itself. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis of the works exemplified through their styles as different from one another, disruption suffered by calviniana scripture, so that Calvin himself breaks the paradigm of traditional perspective of reading as Eco suggests rethinking the understanding of literary texts going beyond appearance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I explore some points of {{possible}} convergence between systemic functional linguistics (hereafter: SFL), general semiotics (hereafter GS), and {{a strain of}} contemporary philosophical thought known as process philosophy or process metaphysics. In doing so I want to suggest some possible points of contact between SFL and some new currents in philosophy that point in some other directions than those that up until now have most commonly {{been associated with the}} philosophy of language and linguistic metatheory. In this connection a central figure is Alfred North Whitehead, the British philosopher, mathematician and logician who is probably best known for his work together with Bertrand Russell on symbolic logic, which as published as Principia Mathematica. What is probably less well known for many is that Whitehead, in the wake of Principia came to diverge in his philosophical interests from Russell, and went on to develop a speculative philosophy that he named Philosophy of Organism, and which has also, for reasons that will become apparent later, also {{came to be known as}} process philosophy. This is then a metatheoretical, or metasemiotic, discourse designed to construe SFL in dialogical terms, not only in relation to the science of semiotics envisioned by Saussure (developed subsequently by Hjelmslev and Greimas) in his Cours de linguistique générale of ‘semiology’ when he spoke of the “science that studies the life of signs within society”, but also as a part of the general semiotics as outlined by Eco as a philosophical project that “studies the whole of human signifying activity - languages - and languages are what constitutes human beings as such, that is, as semiotic animals. It studies languages through languages. ” Such a systematic philosophical investigation of this kind has “pragmatic” effects in itself, since, as <b>Eco</b> also <b>points</b> out: the very act of asking general questions about the whole of human signifying activity in the present, with reference to its past, is inevitably destined to influence the course of this self-same activity in the future. General semiotics must then be seen as necessarily transforming its own object by the very fact of its basic theoretical assumptions...|$|R

40|$|As the {{branding}} {{process is}} intertwined with already existing cultural codes, fundamental cultural processes {{in a society}} might affect the attraction of a specific brand. This means that trends of ethical or political fashions influence the popularity of brands {{and how they are}} realized. This case focuses on how the brand Fjällräven has been acknowledged as having varying political, ethical and fashionable positioning over decades. The case is compared to other related brands, e. g. Haglöfs/Patagonia. A strain of thought can be coined progressivist. The idea within this thought model is that improvement is possible through knowledge, a kind of optimism when it comes to society and human effort to improve its living conditions, and being in the world. This progressivist stance is linked to brands that thus resonates the progressivist believes and hopes so that the brand of Fjällräven can be said to be an example of progression in this progressivist tradition. With reference to Umberto <b>Eco,</b> Martin Kornberger <b>points</b> out that an author seldom, if ever, has any control over the interpretations of their work. The meaning creating process becomes an ever ongoing socially contingent process rather than a stable, once and for all, established fact. Transferred to the field of brands, the idea is that brands resonate in society, and they resonate ideas. Marcel Danesi voices a similar idea when he writes that advertising that is in some sense or another successful always resonates with something outside of the brand meaning itself. An intertextual connection to societal factors. If this is true, then brands resonate not just in an individual sense with individual co-creators, but also in a collective sense with ideas rather than individuals, individuals being the carriers, vehicles if you will, of meaning that co-create meaning but the long term intertextual factors needs to be taken into account. If this is so, then Fjällräven would be a case in point and, further, intertextuality {{does not need to be}} communicated explicitly, it is still present, like progressivism is present and thus would influence the meaning construct of a brand, and consequently its sense of significance, value, for want of a better word...|$|R
