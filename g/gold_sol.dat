50|$|The {{formation}} of uniform <b>gold</b> <b>sols</b> {{produced by the}} citrate reduction of auric acid is explored {{as a function of}} temperature and reagent concentration. As aurate ions are reduced, the reaction medium changes from black to purple to blue before turning deep red.

Electrophoretic and titration studies suggest the colloidal properties of the sols result from a combination of van der Waals, electrostatic, and short-range repulsive interaction potentials. Increases in particle surface potential over the course of the reaction are shown to result from competitive adsorption of citrate and aurate ions.

30|$|Gold {{nanoparticle}} (AuNP)-based colorimetric assays {{have attracted}} considerable attentions in detection applications {{with regard to}} their simplicity and versatility [7, 8]. This colorimetric assay can be easily observed by visual inspection, which avoids the relative complexity inherent in conventional detection methodologies [9]. Because of the electrostatic repulsion resulting from the negative charges on the surfaces, AuNPs are highly stable in the absence of added salts. The addition of electrolytes to <b>gold</b> <b>sols</b> results in the reduction of charge repulsion and as a consequence nanoparticle aggregation. Nonetheless, AuNPs can be stabilized even at high salt concentrations by adsorbing proteins or other hydrophilic polymers (protecting agents) onto their surfaces [10]. They bind the macromolecules by noncovalent electrostatic, stable adsorption [11]. PEG polymer {{is one of the most}} often used stabilizers, as it possesses the advantage of a chemically well-defined composition that ensures the reproducibility of its performance. Moreover, PEG dissolves rapidly and therefore can be prepared just prior to use.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. - In {{a number}} of {{experiments}} on sedimentation in colloidal suspensions, {{the formation of a}} vertically layered structure in the concentration profile has been observed. We argue that this may be interpreted as the formation of shock fronts in the concentration profile due to the concentration dependence of the sedimentation velocity, a mechanism first identified by Kynch. We propose several experiments to test this suggestion, and draw attention to the possibility of observing anomalous diffusion in a sedimenting suspension with reversible aggregation. For over a century[l], it has been known that suspensions often exhibit a stratified structure upon sedimentation. This stratification occurs {{in the form of the}} appearance of one or more horizontal bands, as sketched in fig. 1. Within each band, the suspension appears to be approximately homogeneous, but the concentration (volume fraction) of the suspension differs from one band to the other. Thus, a plot of the concentration us. height shows a staircaselike structure, with the dnterfacesn between the bands corresponding to the vertical positions where the concentration jumps.

The resonance wavelength of Ag-Au alloy colloids exists between those of pure Ag (410 nm) and pure Au (525 nm) colloids, which can easily be controlled by selecting the molar ratio of Ag to Au. This allows the tunability of the absorption wavelength (hence the color) by using Ag-Au alloy colloids in thin films...|$|E
30|$|Shifting of gold plasmon band to {{the higher}} value may be {{explained}} as follows: tomato extract is a strong reducing agent but not a good capping agent. So, it induces rapid nucleation but cannot restrict the growth of gold nanoparticles. Hence, polydispersed gold nanoparticles are observed. When we use tomato extract (100 %), the band shifts to 540 nm and the extinction coefficient decreases appreciably. This {{might be due to}} colloidal instability. The polydispersity and the colloidal instability (agglomeration tendency of gold nanoparticle) may be the reason for a broad spectrum of <b>gold</b> <b>sol</b> along with a shift in the peak position. The shifting of the peak position {{may be related to the}} increase of the size of gold nanoparticles.|$|E
