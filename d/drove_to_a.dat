5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday.

She <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of this {{experience}}, Griffiths decided to seek Holy Orders in the Church of England. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London.

Guided by the writings of Cardinal Newman, he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough. He recounts the story of his conversion in his autobiography The Golden String.|$|R

25|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{in the heavy}} snow storm during the first half, combining for {{the same number of}} punts as first downs (11) and converting only one of 13 third downs. However, Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon was efficient, completing 10 of 14 passes for 87 yards. The closest either team would come to scoring in the first quarter would be New England's drive to the Oakland 31-yard line, which ended when Brady threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 2. With 1:12 left in the quarter, a 15-yard fair catch interference penalty against Patriots defensive back Je'Rod Cherry at the end of Ken Walter's 39-yard punt gave Oakland a first down at midfield, where they <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 7-0 lead on Gannon's 13-yard touchdown pass to James Jett.

Ed Sustersic, the Browns' third-string fullback, ran two yards for another touchdown in the second quarter, giving Cleveland a 14–0 lead. Chicago came close to scoring {{near the end of}} the first half, driving to Cleveland's two-yard line, but the period ended before the Hornets could score. Sustersic ran for another touchdown in the third quarter, and the Browns' defense held Chicago scoreless for the remainder of the game. Graham passed for 80 yards, mostly on short throws to end Mac Speedie, who finished with four catches for 34 yards. Halfback Dub Jones was the team's leading rusher, with 50 yards on two carries. The defense held Chicago to 122 total yards of passing and rushing, and Browns defensive halfbacks had four interceptions. Warren Lahr accounted for two of the interceptions. Paul Brown pulled Graham toward the end of the game, and Cliff Lewis and Edgar Jones spent time at quarterback.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} first quarter, the Patriots drove 71 yards to the Colts' 4-yard line, {{featuring}} a 35-yard run by Corey Dillon.

The Colts responded by driving 56 yards and scoring with Adam Vinatieri's 42-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3. On their ensuing drive, the Patriots <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fourth down on the Colts' 34-yard line. Rather than attempt a 52-yard field goal, New England decided to go for it and Tom Brady completed a 27-yard pass to Troy Brown. On the next play, Dillon scored on a 7-yard touchdown run. Then, two plays after the ensuing kickoff, cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving New England a 21–3 lead. Later in the quarter, Indianapolis drove 80 yards in 15 plays, with Vinatieri finishing the drive with a 26-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–6 with 11 seconds left in the half.|$|E
