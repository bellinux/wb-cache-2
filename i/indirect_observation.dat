60|$|In statistics, it {{is evident}} that {{empirical}} laws may sometimes be traced; and the tracing them forms an important part of that system of <b>indirect</b> <b>observation</b> on which we must often rely for the data of the Deductive Science. The process of the science consists in inferring effects from their causes; but we have often no means of observing the causes, except through the medium of their effects. In such cases the deductive science is unable to predict the effects, for want of the necessary data; it can determine what causes are capable of producing any given effect, but not with what frequency and in what quantities those causes exist. An instance in point is afforded by a newspaper now lying before me. A statement was furnished by one of the official assignees in bankruptcy showing among the various bankruptcies which it had been his duty to investigate, in how many cases the losses had been caused by misconduct of different kinds, and in how many by unavoidable misfortunes. The result was, that the number of failures caused by misconduct greatly preponderated over those arising from all other causes whatever. Nothing but specific experience could have given sufficient ground for a conclusion to this purport. To collect, therefore, such empirical laws (which are never more than approximate generalizations) from direct observation, {{is an important part of}} the process of sociological inquiry.|$|E

For <b>indirect</b> <b>observation,</b> gamma ray and neutrino telescopes look {{for evidence of}} neutralino annihilation in regions of high dark matter density such as the galactic or solar centre. For direct observation, special purpose experiments such as the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) seek to detect the rare impacts of WIMPs in terrestrial detectors. These experiments have begun to probe interesting supersymmetric parameter space, excluding some models for neutralino dark matter, and upgraded experiments with greater sensitivity are under development.|$|E

When they act in society, they do so according {{to the laws of}} history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will.

50|$|Empirical {{research}} is research using empirical evidence. It {{is a way}} of gaining knowledge by means of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>observation</b> or experience. Empiricism values such research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Through quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.|$|E
40|$|In many {{real life}} applications, it is {{impossible}} to observe the feature of interest directly. For example, scientists in Materials Science may be interested in detecting cracks inside objects, not visible from the outside. Similarly, non-invasive medical imaging techniques such as Positrone Emission Tomography rely on <b>indirect</b> <b>observations</b> to reconstruct an image of the patient's internal organs. In this paper, we investigate optimal designs for such indirect regression problems. We determine designs minimizing the integrated mean squared error of estimates of the regression function obtained by Tikhonov or spectral cut-off regularization. We use the optimal designs as benchmarks to investigate the efficiency of the uniform design commonly used in applications. Several examples are discussed to illustrate the results, in most of which the uniform design or a simple modification thereof is demonstrated to be very efficient for the estimation of the regression function. Our designs provide guidelines to scientists regarding the experimental conditions at which the <b>indirect</b> <b>observations</b> should be taken in order to obtain an accurate estimate for the object of interest...|$|R

50|$|Original {{research}} {{can take a}} number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>observation</b> of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In analytical work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or {{a new way of}} approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher.|$|E
50|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{procedures were}} pioneered by interventional radiologists who had first introduced angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent. Many other minimally invasive procedures have followed where images of {{all parts of}} the body can be obtained and used to direct interventional instruments by way of catheters (needles and fine tubes), so that many conditions once requiring open surgery can now be treated non-surgically. A minimally invasive procedure typically involves the use of arthroscopic (for joints and the spine) or laparoscopic devices and remote-control manipulation of instruments with <b>indirect</b> <b>observation</b> of the surgical field through an endoscope or large scale display panel, and is carried out through the skin or through a body cavity or anatomical opening. Interventional radiology now offers many techniques that avoid the need for surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Biosignatures {{need not}} be chemical, however, and can also be {{suggested}} by a distinctive magnetic biosignature. Another possible biosignature might be morphology since the shape and size of certain objects may potentially indicate the presence of past or present life. For example, microscopic magnetite crystals in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 were the longest-debated of several potential biosignatures in that specimen because it was believed until recently that only bacteria could create crystals of their specific shape. However, anomalous features discovered that are [...] "possible biosignatures" [...] for life forms would be investigated as well. Such features constitute a working hypothesis, not a confirmation of detection of life. Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered, requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life. [...] For example, the possible biomineral studied in the Martian ALH84001 meteorite includes putative microbial fossils, tiny rock-like structures whose shape was a potential biosignature because it resembled known bacteria. Most scientists ultimately concluded that these were far {{too small to be}} fossilized cells. A consensus that has emerged from these discussions, and is now seen as a critical requirement, is the demand for further lines of evidence in addition to any morphological data that supports such extraordinary claims. Scientific observations include the possible identification of biosignatures through <b>indirect</b> <b>observation.</b> For example, electromagnetic information through infrared radiation telescopes, radio-telescopes, space telescopes, etc. From this discipline, the hypothetical electromagnetic radio signatures that SETI scans for would be a biosignature, since a message from intelligent aliens would certainly demonstrate the existence of extraterrestrial life.|$|E
