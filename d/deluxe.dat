5|$|When {{thinking}} about including character goods with the volume releases, Sugawara {{came up with}} the atypical idea of releasing a <b>deluxe</b> and normal edition of the manga after contemplating the inconsistency of novels getting both a soft-cover and hard-cover release, but manga only received one version.
