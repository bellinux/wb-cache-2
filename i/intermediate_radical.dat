50|$|The three {{putative}} radical SAM methyltransferases encoded {{within the}} pathway are interesting for both mechanistic and biosynthetic reasons. Radical SAM methyltransferases {{are likely to}} methylate substrates by an unusual mechanism. Biosynthetically, β-methylations of amino acids are highly unusual in natural products. Polytheonamide B, a peptide natural product produced by a marine symbiont, is the only other structurally characterized example of direct β-methylation of a peptide natural product. The proposed methyl transfer from a SAM-utilizing enzyme was supported by earlier feeding studies with labeled methionine; labeled methionine is used because methionine is converted into SAM within cells. Even further, this study used stereospecifically labeled methionine (methyl-(2H-3H)-(2S, methyl-R)-methionine) to show that methylation occurred with a net retention of stereochemistry at the methyl group. The author speculated that net retention indicated a radical mechanism with a B12 <b>intermediate.</b> <b>Radical</b> transfer with a cobalmin B12 cofactor and SAM has been shown with the few characterized radical SAM methyltransferases. Although the evidence points to radical β-methylation during bottromycin biosynthesis, {{it remains to be}} seen whether bioinformatic hypothesis and feeding studies will be supported by in vitro activity assays.|$|E
5000|$|Controlled radical polymerization, namely {{reversible}} addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), is {{a common}} method for the polymerization of acrylates, methacrylates and acrylamides. Usually, a thiocarbonate is used in combination with an effective initiator for RAFT. The thiocarbonate moiety can be functionalized at the R-group for end group analysis. The end group {{is a result of}} the propagation of chain-transfer agents during the free-radical polymerization process. The end groups can subsequently be modified by the reaction of the thiocarbonylthio compounds with nucleophiles and ionic reducing agents. The method for removal of thiocarbonyl containing end groups includes reacting the polymers containing the end-groups with en excess of radicals which add to the reactive C=S bond of the end group forming an <b>intermediate</b> <b>radical</b> (shown below). The remaining radical on the polymer chain can be hydrogenated by what is referred to as a trapping group and terminate; this results in a polymer that is free of the end groups at the α and ω positions. Another method of end group removal for the thiocarbonyl containing end-groups of RAFT polymers is the addition of heat to the polymer; this is referred to as thermolysis. One method of monitoring thermolysis of RAFT polymers is by thermogravietric analysis resulting in a weight-loss of the end group. An advantage of this technique is that no additional chemicals are required to remove the end group; however, it is required that the polymer be thermally stable to high temperature and therefore may not be effective for some polymers. Depending on the polymers sensitivity to [...] ultraviolet radiation (UV) it has been reported in recent years that decomposition of end-groups can be effective, but preliminary data suggest that decomposition by UV leads to a change in the distribution of molecular weights of the polymer.|$|E

40|$|Rate {{retardation}} in reversible addition-fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) -mediated polymerizations is {{the topic of}} an ongoing debate. One of the main explanations for this rate retardation is termination of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>radical.</b> The use of a RAFT agent with a UV label in the leaving group acts {{as a means to}} identify products of <b>intermediate</b> <b>radical</b> termination (IRT). In the analysis of the polymeric samples with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), two different UV absorbance traces were compared (i. e., the UV absorbance of the label used and that of the thiocarbonyl thio moiety of the RAFT agent). Deviations in the ratio of the C=S of the RAFT moiety to the UV label indicate that IRT products could be formed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify these IRT products formed during a "normal" RAFT-mediated polymerization (not using forced conditions).

50|$|In the {{presence}} of samarium iodide, the halogen atom of alkyl, alkenyl, and aryl halides is replaced by hydrogen. In tetrahydrofuran, the mechanism of alkyl halide reduction likely proceeds through <b>radical</b> <b>intermediates.</b> However, alkyl halide reductions employing HMPA as a co-solvent likely involve {{a large proportion of}} organosamarium intermediates. A unified mechanistic picture is shown below. Initial electron transfer and loss of halide generate an organic radical, which may combine with a second molecule of samarium iodide to form an organosamarium species.

40|$|A novel dithioester control agent [dimethyltetrathioterephtalate (DMTTT) ] is {{presented}} for the thioketone-mediated radical polymerization (TKMP) of n-butyl acrylate. The rate of polymerization is significantly decreased {{in the presence}} of DMTTT indicating formation of dormant radical species. During polymerization, molar masses increase linearly with monomer conversion with reasonably narrow initial molar mass distributions (PDI between 1. 3 and 1. 8), whereas the dispersity increases {{during the course of the}} polymerization due to irreversible termination of both propagating and dormant radicals.
