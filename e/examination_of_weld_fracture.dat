40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{resistance}} spot <b>welding</b> <b>of</b> two galvanized DP 600 steels with 1. 8 and 2. 0 -mm sheet thickness was investi-gated to enhance our understanding <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> <b>fracture</b> during a well-established au-tomotive quality control test. The effects of several process parameters (including weld current, weld time, and weld force) on zinc expulsion, mechanical properties, defects, and microstructures <b>of</b> {{resistance spot}} <b>welds</b> were all studied in {{relation with the}} two major types <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> <b>fracture</b> (i. e., interfacial and button pullout). It was es-tablished that the slight differences in chemical composition and galvanized coating between the two selected DP 600 steels affected negligibly weld microstruc-tures, and were of no measurable conse-quences to <b>weld</b> <b>fracture.</b> In contrast, the difference of 10 % for their sheet thickness was responsible for smaller weld diame-ters, lower weld tensile-shear forces, larger shrinkage voids, and more frequent interfacial <b>fractures</b> in <b>welds</b> from the thicker DP 600 steel. For the two steels, oc-currence <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> interfacial <b>fracture</b> was eliminated using long weld times (> 20 cy-cles), low currents ( 900 lb, or 4. 0 kN); i. e., process parameters that increased weld diameters while preventing zinc ingestion into the fu-sion zone. The effect of zinc was most prominent in welds that were made ab-normally fast (e. g., ~ 5 cycles), where both solidification cracking and a change in type <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> <b>fracture</b> were found due to in-terdendritic low-melting point con-stituents...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Capacitor {{discharge}} welding (CDW) is a rapid solidification joining process {{under the}} influence of one-dimensional thermal gradients. Although CDW is useful for joining small parts and dissimilar metals, CD welded joints have a large variability in weld strength. CDW is not widely accepted {{because of a lack of}} automated process control. Studying the sources of variability in the CDW process can guide the automation of CDW. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate sources of variability that affect weld strength and to generate a model to predict the weld strength variability in CDW. The source of variability was investigated by using screening experiments. Four different materials, stainless steel, Nitronic 50 Steel, copper, and low oxygen copper (C 101), were selected to represent various levels of thermal conductivity and absorbed gas content. Thermal conductivity, percentage of gas content absorbed, diameter, and welding time were treated as the independent variables while the dependent variables were the standard deviation <b>of</b> CD <b>weld</b> strength as a percentage of base material strength and the mean <b>of</b> CD <b>weld</b> strength as a percentage of base material strength. A screening experiment and a statistical analysis of the data were used to develop a predictive model <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> strength variability in CDW. Electron photomicrographs <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces and dynamic current and resistance curves for each welding cycle were used to support conclusions from the statistical analysis.

40|$|In several {{locations}} of the pressurized water reactors, dissimilar metal welds using Inconel welding wires are used to join the low alloy steel components to stainless steel pipes.

In this study, dissimilar metal <b>welds</b> composed <b>of</b> low alloy steel, Inconel 82 / 182 weld, and stainless steel were prepared by gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding techniques.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} different modeling {{strategies for}} spot welds and rivets usable in crash simulations of whole vehicles. The simplified models {{are based on}} solid elements and connector elements. The damage parameters are obtained by simulation of specimen tests containing only one spot weld or rivet and conducted under different loading situations (lap-shear, pure tension and peeling) and different loading velocities. Spot welded and riveted component tests {{have been carried out}} and simulated for verifying the calibrated spot weld and rivet models. The actual limits are the restrictions of modeling the accurate failure behavior. A spot weld model which is calibrated to fail by peel-out or pull-out fracture has no possibility to change the fracture mode to interfacial fracture. By contrast detailed 3 D finite element models with zone specific material properties and advanced micromechanical damage models are able to predict the change of fracture mode from interfaciai to peelout fracture. Of course these detailed models are not applicable to crash simulation <b>of</b> all spot <b>welds</b> <b>of</b> a whole car.

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} a hybrid joint beam for the tilting car body was evaluated {{in comparison to the}} case of static fracture. Specimen beams of the hybrid joint part attached in the real tilting car body were fabricated for the bending test. Characteristic fracture behaviors of hybrid joint beam specimens under cyclic transverse loads were very different from the case under static loads. Static transverse load caused shear deformation and fracture in the honeycomb core region, while cyclic transverse load brought about delamination along the interface between composite skin and honeycomb core layers as well as <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>welded</b> joint. <b>Fracture</b> characteristics obtained by the transverse fatigue tests were reflected for improving the hybrid joint structure in the real tilting car body...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fracture}} mechanism <b>of</b> friction stir <b>welded</b> blanks is {{studied in}} this paper. An extensive test matrix comprising ten different weld configurations {{is designed for}} the study. The welds are produced with ten combinations of different alloys and thicknesses. The selected alloys are 2024 -T 3 and 7075 -T 6 and the thickness ratio varies between 1 and 1. 7. Welding parameters are optimized {{for each of the}} studied configurations. Tensile tests are conducted on some samples <b>of</b> the <b>welds.</b> The <b>fracture</b> surfaces are inspected by SEM to determine the type of mechanism governing the fracture of the specimens. The results of the study are compared with the literature and are extensively discussed {{to determine whether or not}} the thermomechanical evolutions taken place during the welding process change the fracture mechanism of the studied alloys...|$|R
