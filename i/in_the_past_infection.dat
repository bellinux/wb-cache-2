40|$|Background: The present {{understanding}} of the clinical course, complications, and outcome of myasthenic crisis (MC) is based chiefly on observational studies and retrospective case series. Aim: To study the baseline demographic and clinical variables, risk factors, complications, outcome, and mortality in patients of MC. Materials and Methods: All patients of myasthenia gravis (MG) who presented with myasthenic crisis between July 2009 and December 2010 were included. Results: Ten patients of MC were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 40. 5 years (range 14 - 71 years). Seven were females and three were males. Nine had generalized MG and one patient had oculobulbar involvement only. Median duration of disease was 3 years (range 1 month to 17 years). Two patients had thymoma. Two patients had history of thymectomy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>Infection</b> {{was the most common}} triggering factor accounting for five cases (50 %) followed by inadequate treatment/drug withdrawal in three (30 %) and steroid initiation and hypokalemia in the remaining two patients (20 %). Median duration of MC was 12 days (range 3 - 28 days). Mortality was in 3 out of 10 (30 %) during MC. Management {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) and treatment with plasma exchange/intravenous immunoglobulins were associated with good outcome. Conclusions: Ventilator support and management in intensive care unit are the most important components in the management of MC. The high mortality rate seen in present study may be more reflective of the actual ground reality in resource constrained developing countries, however, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{the ancestral}} sylvatic cycle of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is not well {{understood}} in the endemic areas of eastern Africa. We therefore analysed the ASF infection status on samples collected from 51 free-ranging warthogs (Phacocherus africanus) and 1576 Ornithodorus porcinus ticks from 26 independent warthog burrows at a single ranch in Kenya. Abattoir samples from 83 domestic pigs without clinical symptoms, originating from specific locations with no recent reported ASF outbreaks were included in this study. All samples were derived from areas of central Kenya, where ASF outbreaks have been reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>Infection</b> with ASFV was confirmed in 22 % of O. porcinus pools, 3. 22 % of adult warthog serum samples and 49 % of domestic pig serum samples by using p 72 -based PCR. All of the warthog sera were positive for anti-ASFV antibodies, investigated by using ELISA, {{but none of the}} domestic pig sera were positive. Twenty O. porcinus-, 12 domestic pig- and three warthogderived viruses were genotyped at four polymorphic loci. The ASFV isolates from ticks and domestic pigs clustered within p 72 genotype X. By contrast, ASF viruses genotyped directly from warthog sera, at same locality as the tick isolates, were within p 72 genotype IX and genetically similar to viruses causing recent ASF outbreaks in Kenya and Uganda. This represents the first report of the co-existence of different ASFV genotypes in warthog burrow-associated ticks and adult wild warthogs. The data from this and earlier studies suggest transfer of viruses of at least two different p 72 genotypes, from wild to domestic pigs in East Africa...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundLow malaria {{parasite}} densities {{in pregnancy}} are a diagnostic challenge. PCR provides high {{sensitivity and specificity}} in detecting low density of parasites, but cost and technical requirements limit its application in resources-limited settings. Pooling samples for PCR detection was explored to estimate prevalence of submicroscopic malaria infection in pregnant women at delivery. Previous work uses gold-standard based methods to calculate sensitivity and specificity of tests, creating a challenge when newer methodologies are substantially more sensitive than the gold standard. Thus prevalence was estimated using Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) in this study. MethodsNested PCR (nPCR) for the 18 S rRNA gene subunit of Plasmodium falciparum was conducted to detect malaria infection in microscopy-negative Malawian women on IPTp. Two-step sample pooling used dried blood spot samples (DBSs) collected from placenta or periphery at delivery. Results from nPCR and histology as well as previously published data were used to construct LCMs to estimate assay sensitivity and specificity. Theoretical confidence intervals for prevalence of infection were calculated for two-step and one-step pooling strategies. ResultsOf 617 microscopy-negative Malawian women, 39 (6. 3 %) were identified as actively infected by histology while 52 (8. 4 %) were positive by nPCR. One hundred forty (22. 7 %) individuals had past infection assessed by histology. With histology as a reference, 72 % {{of women in the}} active infection group, 7. 1 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>infection</b> group and 3. 2 % in histology-negative group were nPCR positive. Using latent class models without a gold standard, histology had a median sensitivity of 49. 7 % and specificity of 97. 6 % for active infection while PCR had a median sensitivity of 96. 0 % and specificity of 99. 1 %. The true prevalence of active infection was estimated at 8. 0 % (CI: 5. 8 - 10. 5 %) from PCR. PCR also had similar sensitivity for detecting either peripheral or placental malaria for submicroscopic infections. One-step pooling would give similar confidence intervals for pool sizes less than 20 while reducing the number of tests performed. ConclusionsPooled nPCR testing was a sensitive and resource-efficient strategy and LCMs provided precise prevalence estimates of submicroscopic infections. Compared to two-step pooling, one-step pooling could provide similar prevalence estimates at population levels with many fewer tests required.

40|$|Ichthyobodosis is an {{important}} parasitic disease that has caused severe loss among ornamental and farmed fish world wide {{for more than a}} century. The disease is caused by heavy infections on skin and gills by parasitic flagellates belonging to <b>the</b> genus Ichthyobodo. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>infections</b> worldwide have commonly been identified as due to a single variable species, I. necator. However, recent molecular studies have revealed that the genus Ichthyobodo consist of several different species and is far more complex than previously believed. The overall aim of this PhD project has been to identify and characterise Ichthyobodo species with emphasis on those that are known from Norwegian aquaculture. Therefore, effective and sensitive molecular methods (PCR techniques) for detection and identification of Ichthyobodo spp. have been developed and validated. With the aid of such methods several new Ichthyobodo genotypes have been detected from both farmed and wild fish. Working with molecularly identified Ichthyobodo genotypes has led to improved knowledge of character variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus. Also, novel morphological characters have been identified, aiding species discrimination. Hence both molecular and morphological tools are provided that may facilitate the future description of other Ichthyobodo spp. Morphological descriptions of three Ichthyobodo species is presented, so far the only valid species within genus Ichthyobodo that have also been characterized through their DNA sequences. All presently valid Ichthyobodo species have been detected on both farmed and wild caught hosts in Norway: 1.

Strikingly, these murine pB-ALLs closely resemble the human disease. Tumor exome sequencing revealed activating somatic, nonsynonymous mutations of Jak 3 as a second hit. Transplantation experiments and deep sequencing suggest that inactivating mutations in Pax 5 promote leukemogenesis by creating an aberrant progenitor compartment that is susceptible to malignant transformation through accumulation of secondary Jak 3 mutations. Thus, treatment of Pax 5 (+/-) leukemic cells with specific JAK 1 / 3 inhibitors resulted in increased apoptosis. These results uncover the causal role of infection in pB-ALL development...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To improve {{transfusion}} {{policy and}} to increase understanding of the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population, HCV infections among voluntary Dutch blood donors were examined with molecular epidemiologic techniques. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 6 years, 1997 through 2002, confirmed anti-HCV-positive donors were interviewed on HCV-associated risk behavior with a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, HCV isolates were genotyped, partially sequenced, and compared to sequences obtained from Dutch injecting drug users (IDUs). RESULTS: HCV prevalence and incidence rates among Dutch donors were extremely low; the residual risk of transmitting HCV was calculated to be 1 in 30 million donations. Former IDUs (21 %), transfusion recipients (30 %), and immigrants (> 12 %) were identified as major HCV risk groups. Cryptogenic transmission caused 18 percent of infections among new donors and all infections among repeat donors. Compared to IDUs, genotype distribution among donors was highly diverse; major subtypes were 3 a (27 %), 1 a (24 %), 1 b (24 %), 2 a/b (10 %), and 4 (9 %). Half of the donors were infected with IDU-related subtypes 1 a and 3 a, whereas subtype 1 b mainly spread via blood transfusion and various other nosocomial modes of transmission <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> HCV <b>infections</b> acquired <b>in</b> endemic countries could be clearly identified based on genotype.

Level of education and urban residence were positively significantly related to HIV status both at bivariate and multivariate levels. Household wealth status was positively associated with HIV status at the bivariate level, but negatively related with HIV status at the multivariate level though not statistically significantly.

Indeed, although the drug is licensed only for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs), several clinical trials are currently ongoing. New cephalosporins owing antibacterial activity against MRSA have also appeared recently. In addition to a strong bactericidal activity and a favourable safety profile, these drugs have proven efficient for the treatment of infections involving Gram-positive agents, that is, community-acquired pneumonia (ceftaroline), health care-associated pneumonia (ceftobiprole), as well as ABSSSIs. In spite of a broad spectrum of activity covering Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftobiprole only), clinical data are mandatory before expanding their use to the critically ill patients with pneumonia, given pharmacokinetic issues in this setting.

Although EHEC strains belonging to the serotype O 104 :H 4 has rarely been associated with human diseases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> outbreaks of <b>infections</b> caused by this organism resulted to HUS and bloody diarrhoea in humans in countries that have advanced public health facilities. The {{aim of this study}} was to isolate E. coli O 104 strains from meat samples obtained from supermarkets and retail shops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North West Province, South Africa. A further objective was to determine the identities of the isolates using Gram staining, preliminary biochemical tests (oxidase test, Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) test, citrate utilization and Sorbitol fermentation test) and confirmatory (API 20 E and PCR analysis) assays. A total of nineteen meat samples were collected from four butcheries and shops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study area and Sorbitol MacConkey agar was used for selective isolation of bacteria. A total of 304 presumptive colonies were subjected to identification tests for E. coli.

Incomplete understanding of mechanisms and correlates of protection against RSV mean that, {{for the time}} being, successful RSV vaccines must directly demonstrate efficacy, which necessitates large and costly clinical trials in naturally infected patients. To mitigate <b>the</b> risks inherent <b>in</b> progressing to these late-stage trials, experimental human RSV infection studies have recently been re-established, representing the interface between pre-clinical models and observational studies of patients. Not only can they be used for early proof-of-concept clinical trials to test vaccine efficacy, but human challenge studies also offer the potential to better understand protective immunity against RSV infection to improve vaccine design and delivery. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> controlled human <b>infection</b> studies with RSV have been instrumental <b>in</b> elucidating <b>the</b> influence of factors such as route of infection and type of inoculum on the course of disease.

40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of CMV infection is challenging {{and the quality}} of serological laboratory testing is critical, especially in pregnancy and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination of transplant recipients and donors serostatus. Objectives: Evaluate the performances of the new LIAISON® CMV II line: LIAISON® CMV IgG II, LIAISON® CMV IgM II and LIAISON® CMV IgG Avidity II <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> routine methods used in our laboratory. Study design: The evaluation of LIAISON® CMV IgG II and LIAISON® CMV IgM II was performed on both prospective routine samples and retrospective selected samples for a total of 383 sera. CMV IgG avidity was assessed with 88 samples. Results: The overall agreement was 98. 8 % for the IgG and 95 % for the IgM on the routine population. On selected retrospective samples, excellent agreement was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seronegative and <b>past</b> <b>infection</b> groups. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> recent infection group, discordances were observed in 7. 1 % of IgG and 13. 1 % of IgM. No recent infection was missed with LIAISON®. Avidity agreement with VIDAS® was 81 %. On 51 sera with a known time of infection, no high avidity was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group infected for less than 3 months and 82 % of the samples showed a high avidity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group infected for more than 3 months.

Phocine and canine distemper viruses (CDV) were isolated as causative agents in different epidemics of seals. Phocine distemper virus 1 (PDV- 1) and CDV represent two distinct but antigenetically and genetically related morbilliviruses (5).

40|$|Background By global {{standards}} {{the prevalence}} of community onset expanded-spectrum cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli (ESC-R-EC) remains low in Australia and New Zealand. Of concern, our countries are {{in a unique position}} with high extramural resistance pressure from close population and trade links to Asia-Pacific neighbours with high ESC-R-EC rates. We aim to characterize the risks and dynamics of community onset ESC-R-EC in our low-prevalence region. Methods A case-control methodology was used. Patients with ESC-R-EC or susceptible E. coli isolated from blood or urine were recruited at six geographically dispersed tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Epidemiological data was prospectively collected and bacteria were retained for analysis. Results In total, 182 patients (91 cases and 91 controls) were recruited. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors for ESC-R amongst E. coli including birth on the Indian subcontinent (OR= 11. 13, 2. 17 - 56. 98, p= 0. 003), urinary tract <b>infection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year (per <b>infection</b> OR= 1. 430, 1. 13 - 1. 82, p= 0. 003), travel to South East Asia, China, Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Middle East (OR= 3. 089, 1. 29 - 7. 38, p= 0. 011), prior exposure to trimethoprim+/-sulfamethoxazole &/or an expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (OR= 3. 665, 1. 30 - 10. 35, p= 0. 014) and healthcare exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous six months (OR= 3. 16, 1. 54 - 6. 46, p= 0. 02).

40|$|Earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> century, <b>infections</b> were {{regarded}} as the most likely cause of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL). However, {{there is a lack}} of relevant biologic evidence supporting this hypothesis. We present in vivo genetic evidence mechanistically connecting inherited susceptibility to pB-ALL and postnatal infections by showing that pB-ALL was initiated in Pax 5 heterozygous mice only when they were exposed to common pathogens. Strikingly, these murine pB-ALLs closely resemble the human disease. Tumor exome sequencing revealed activating somatic, nonsynonymous mutations of Jak 3 as a second hit. Transplantation experiments and deep sequencing suggest that inactivating mutations in Pax 5 promote leukemogenesis by creating an aberrant progenitor compartment that is susceptible to malignant transformation through accumulation of secondary Jak 3 mutations. Thus, treatment of Pax 5 leukemic cells with specific JAK 1 / 3 inhibitors resulted in increased apoptosis. These results uncover the causal role of infection in pB-ALL development. [Significance]: These results demonstrate that delayed infection exposure is a causal factor in pB-ALL. Therefore, these findings have critical implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia and for the development of novel therapies for this disease. J.

As limited information on Trichinella infection in wildlife of Hungary is available, 2116 red foxes, representing more than 3 % of the estimated fox population of the country, were screened to detect Trichinella larvae by a digestion method. Trichinella larvae from the 35 positive foxes were identified by a multiplex PCR as Trichinella britovi (30 isolates, 85. 7 %), Trichinella spiralis (4 isolates, 11. 4 %), and Trichinella pseudospiralis (1 isolate, 2. 9 %). The true mean intensity of T. britovi, T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis larvae in lower forelimb muscles was 23. 6, 3. 5 and 13. 5 larvae/g, respectively.
