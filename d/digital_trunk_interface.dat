50|$|PDT (short for Professional <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking</b> or Police <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking)</b> {{is an open}} {{industry}} standard for trunked radio system in China servicing police wireless communications and professional mobile radio. The standard is being maintained by the Professional <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking</b> System Industry Association, an association of major vendors of wireless communications equipment in China. The association was formed with the help from Information and Communications Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. The standard was used to facilitate the digital transformation of the Ministry's existing MPT analogue trunking system. Government policy supporting this domestic standard had lead to the abolishment of previous GA/T {{industry standard}}s based on the European TETRA standard.|$|R

50|$|Line {{signaling}} {{is concerned}} with conveying information {{on the state of}} the line or channel, such as on-hook, off-hook (answer supervision and disconnect supervision, together referred to as supervision), ringing current (alerting), and recall. In the middle 20th century, supervision signals on long-distance trunks in North America were usually inband, for example at 2600 Hz, necessitating a notch filter to prevent interference. Late in the century, all supervisory signals were out of band. With the advent of <b>digital</b> <b>trunks,</b> supervision signals are carried by robbed bits or other bits in the E1-carrier dedicated to signaling.|$|R

Unlike the SM in the competitive 5ESS Switch, the TCUs did not perform all call processing functions, but limited themselves to digit collection and signalling interpretation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. TETRA is a <b>digital</b> <b>trunked</b> mobile radio standard, {{developed}} {{to meet the}} needs of traditional Professional Mobile Radio user organizations. As TETRA does not provide for broadband services, many companies are looking into integration of LTE and TETRA in order to provide support for real time multimedia services. Fast handover among these networks is paramount for mission critical applications. Therefore this paper explores the possibilities and advantages of using the Media Independent Handover, an IEEE standard, in improving the handover performance in a TETRA-LTE heterogeneous environment. Additionally it identifies the main challenges related to handover between these two networks...|$|R
50|$|In the U.S. {{telephone}} network, the 12-channel {{carrier system}} {{was an early}} frequency-division multiplexing system standard, used to carry multiple telephone calls on a single twisted pair of wires, mostly for short to medium distances. In this system twelve voice channels are multiplexed in a high frequency carrier and passed through a balanced pair trunk line {{similar to those used}} for individual voice frequency connections. The original system is obsolete today, but the multiplexing of voice channels in units of 12 or 24 channels in modern <b>digital</b> <b>trunk</b> lines such as T-1 is a legacy of the system.|$|R
