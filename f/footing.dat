5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their <b>footing</b> as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta {{ownership}} {{was never}} on sound financial <b>footing.</b> Longtime general manager Cliff Fletcher said {{years later that}} Cousins' initial financial projections for an NHL team did {{not account for the}} WHA entering the picture. The Flames were also a poor draw, and never signed a major television contract.|$|E

5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their <b>footing</b> and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|It first {{aired in}} the United States on October 14, 2008 on the Fox network, and {{was seen by}} an {{estimated}} 9.157 million American viewers, the network's second highest rated show for the week. Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive, as many believed the series was finally finding its <b>footing.</b> Others however critiqued the episode for seeming too ordinary for a science fiction series.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the United States began {{holding an}} annual {{national}} competition—the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal <b>footing</b> and meant that international competitions became possible.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive <b>footing</b> structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery <b>footing,</b> the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} also an attempt to place the {{relationship}} between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new <b>footing.</b> As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions about how the power the Lords continued to hold would be used.

5|$|The simple {{appearance}} of MiGs could often accomplish their mission by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads {{as a defensive}} measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbeds, which could fight on a more equal <b>footing</b> with the U.S. aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was maintaining an interceptor force of 100 aircraft, {{many of which were}} based on PRC airfields and out of reach of American air attack.|$|E
5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given equal <b>footing</b> with men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E
5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have come and gone, due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal <b>footing.</b> When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him that he {{has no choice but to}} kill Ozai.|$|E

After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid <b>footing</b> as a couple.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} Australian waters, Sydney {{spent most}} of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises. In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, Sydney was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war <b>footing,</b> where she arrived on 22 August.|$|E

Flat <b>feet</b> generally do not cause problems but may sometimes cause the <b>foot</b> to rotate inwards (pronation). There are orthotic shoe insoles (<b>foot</b> orthotics) that help correct flat <b>feet.</b> Surgery does not correct flat <b>feet</b> and should be avoided.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{airlines}} {{were considering}} upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and SNECMA were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm <b>footing</b> in both the military and commercial realms.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new <b>footing.</b> Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
40|$|A pad is {{disclosed}} {{for use in}} a {{weighing system}} for weighing a load. The pad includes a weighing platform, load cells, and <b>foot</b> members. Improvements to the pad reduce or substantially eliminate rotation of {{one or more of the}} corner <b>foot</b> members. A flexible <b>foot</b> strap disposed between the corner <b>foot</b> members reduces rotation of the respective <b>foot</b> members about vertical axes through the corner <b>foot</b> members and couples the corner <b>foot</b> members such that rotation of one corner <b>foot</b> member results in substantially the same amount of rotation of the other comer <b>foot</b> member. In a strapless variant one or more fasteners prevents substantially all rotation of a <b>foot</b> member.
