5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier's later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of Wuthering Heights was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the Daily Herald newspaper that the production [...] "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> the wind against the windows, the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work." [...] While Screenonline states that Lee Oswald—Assassin (1966) [...] "could be argued [...] of historical interest only", due to its basis in the flawed Warren Commission report, The Times praised it as being [...] "possibly the first drama-documentary".|$|E
500|$|Foo Fighters earned mostly {{positive}} reviews upon release. Many critics {{compared the}} album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear {{it in the way}} Nevermind taught us to hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the single}} {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose the song as an album highlight. Echoing this thought, Steve Beebee of rock magazine Kerrang! added that it [...] "develops into a searching, soulful hook, ranging high {{among the best}} material this band has ever recorded." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner labelled the recording as a track to consider downloading, further writing that [...] "'My Heart Is Broken' would strongly beg to differ, with a dashing piano riff skittling over growling guitar strums serving as a backdrop for her emotive alto-soprano." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "On 'My Heart Is Broken', a gorgeous piano intro rises alongside Lee's vibrant vocal delivery as Will Hunt's airtight drumming propels the tune into another realm." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME praised [...] "My Heart Is Broken", saying that it [...] "sounds quite {{a lot like a}} Disney ballad, beginning with Amy Lee cooing 'I will wander until the end of time' over a piano line straight off Powers Ballad Vol.12. It gets heavier at the end though, don't worry." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters concluded that the song was [...] "bluntly titled", while The Hollywood Reporters Sophie Schillaci called it a [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] ballad. Describing the song as [...] "fiery", Chad Grischow of IGN noted that in [...] "My Heart Is Broken", [...] "Lee's siren-esque vocals shine, [...] the band takes a few interesting chances late in the album." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe called the single [...] "a banshee <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> defiant, [...] self-lacerating rage." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever, as heard in her piercing wails on hit-in-waiting 'My Heart Is Broken'." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic confessed that, [...] "Really, when your heart is broken, you want a song that's as idea driven as 'My Heart is Broken' to carry you through and that's what she [...] delivers." [...] Additionally, Arwa Haider of Metro commented, [...] "Standard romantic rock bluster from Evanescence. Frontwoman Amy Lee still sounds like she’d tear strips off any would-be lothario." ...|$|E

[...] On 22 November 2006, Litvinenko's medical staff at University College Hospital reported Litvinenko had suffered a [...] "major setback" [...] due to either heart failure or an overnight heart attack. He died on 23 November. The following day, Putin publicly stated: “Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus”.|$|E

"Along {{with the}} blue shirts, the red ties, the clenched fists, the raised arm salute, came the banners, the slogans, the demonstrations; all the trappings that make for totalitarian, unthinking mass fervor.

I can still recall the <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> triumph that rose from these young people at one of our meetings when {{for the first time}} Norman Thomas returned the clenched fist salute to them. As I stood at his side, my arms deliberately folded to indicate that I would have no part of this, their cheers for Thomas rose to almost uncontrollable frenzy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wrestler has {{received}} much critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of critics gave the film positive write-ups {{based upon a}} sample of 222, {{and gave it a}} Golden Tomato for best drama of 2008. The critical consensus states that [...] "Mickey Rourke gives a performance for the ages in The Wrestler, a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama." [...] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film {{has received}} an average score of 81, based on 36 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, [...] "Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> pain that seems to come from a very real place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Architects' primary musical {{influences}} {{have been}} described as ranging through artists from the realms of hardcore punk and heavy metal music such as Botch, Converge, Decapitated, Deftones, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Gojira, Hatebreed, Meshuggah, Shadows Fall, Slipknot and Thrice, and Alex Henderson of AllMusic considers the band to be influenced by noise rock and math rock. Rock Sound Kevin Stewart-Panko writer sees the band as a [...] "metal/hardcore outfit influenced by Meshuggah's low-end guitar lurch, the throat-shredding <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> Converge's Jake Bannon, The Dillinger Escape Plan's staccato one-two rhythms and breakdowns from the state of Massachusetts is its own mystery." [...] Alter the Press! writer Selina Christoforou considered the band drawing on [...] "the template drawn out by genre-defining bands, such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch, and Coalesce".|$|E

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over the years of Gilbert Jessop's innings of 157 {{in an hour and}} the {{reactions}} of the coloured cricketers. C.L.R. James reports that Float Woods [...] "went to his captain and asked permission to take off his boots. West Indian captain Aucher Warner asked him why: he replied that he could bowl properly only when barefooted. Woods was making the best response he knew to a truly desperate situation." [...] Sammy Woods in his autobiography reports that Jessop [...] "hit the two famous Black Bowlers (Cumberbatch and Woods) so furiously that not only they couldn't bowl for laughter, {{but the rest of the}} dark ones in the field rolled about and set up a <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> delight". Archie Cumberbatch was, of course, not on the tour at all and this and other remarks are probably embellished. Overall the reports are of doubtful accuracy and have racist undertones to them.|$|E

[...] Then the four Holy People who had come up from the Third World departed as well. They were , Talking God, , Water Sprinkler, , House God, and , Black God, the god of fire. As they departed, [...] said, [...] "If anyone sees us it will be a sign that an enemy is coming into the country. If he hears us call, that same person will be killed by an enemy before the day is over." [...] And so saying they all returned to their homes and all their powers went with them.|$|E

2500|$|Cronin {{also came}} to feel that [...] "If we {{consider}} the physical universe,... we cannot escape {{the notion of a}} primary Creator.... Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species, its scientific doctrine of natural causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. Ex nihilo nihil, as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." [...] This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting [...] "a frankly atheistic approach," [...] described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, [...] "though he did not say how," [...] of the first primitive life-form from lifeless matter. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, [...] "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," [...] and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer [...] "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into a <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by one word of challenge from a simple-minded boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 August, the leading {{authorities}} of Hunedoara County came to Lupeni, accompanied by 80 troops from the 4th frontier guards regiment and some 20 gendarmes. The mining company attempted to start the power station with strike-breakers {{in order to prevent}} the mines from being flooded and those underground from being asphyxiated, but the strikers maintained a cordon around the works. (A prosecutor later reported that the men inside the power station were [...] "armed with stakes, iron bars, bludgeons and revolvers and were awaiting the authorities with aggressive poses".) The public prosecutor made a final demand that the strikers withdraw from the power station; the strikers replied with a <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> defiance. Some 40 gendarmes now present advanced, trying to intimidate the strikers. According to later testimony, the workers then threw objects toward the gendarmes, wounding those in the first line. When a striker fired a revolver, the 80 troops fired warning shots into the air. As the miners' aggressiveness was undiminished, the troops fired 78 bullets into the crowd (without orders, as established by an enquiry), some lodging in the power station's chimney. When the firing ceased, dozens of men lay on the ground; the rest, panic-stricken, fled quickly. Work at the station resumed immediately; troops and gendarmes guarded the station and all mine buildings.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant <b>howl</b> <b>of</b> self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
