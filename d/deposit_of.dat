5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call {{him as soon as}} he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E
50|$|Armenia {{is a major}} {{producer}} of molybdenum. The Zangezur copper-molybdenum complex possesses large molybdenum reserves that are concentrated in the Kajaran deposit.

5|$|Like {{any other}} mint the New Orleans Mint was a factory to make coins. Operations at the New Orleans Mint began on March 8, 1838, with the <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> the first Mexican gold bullion. The first coins, 30 dimes, were struck on May 7. Until {{it was taken}} over by the Confederacy in 1861 it {{produced}} many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver three-cent pieces (1851 only), half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, silver dollars, gold dollars, $2.50 quarter eagles, three-dollar pieces, $5 half-eagles, $10 eagles, and $20 double eagles.|$|E
5|$|Marble is {{the most}} {{significant}} mineral <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E
5|$|Near Umbriel's equator {{lies the}} most {{prominent}} surface feature: Wunda crater, which has a diameter of about 131km.

The registrar registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Marshall's {{paternal}} grandfather, Riley Marshall, {{immigrated to}} Indiana in 1817 and {{settled on a}} farm in present-day Whitley County. He became wealthy when a moderate <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 chained dollars. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and {{spend the rest of his}} life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party, serving as an Indiana State Senator, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able to send his only child, Daniel, to medical school.|$|E
5|$|Together with Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens, the Goat Rocks volcano {{is part of}} a {{triangle}} of volcanoes, an arrangement not found elsewhere in the Cascades. This may be related to a mid-crust zone with abnormally high electrical conductivity, the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC), which is not well understood by geologists. Scientists from the United States Geodynamics Committee hypothesized in 1994 that this anomaly is associated with the thrust of a large <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> sedimentary rock against a continental margin. However, Hill et al. (2009) dismiss this view as it proves inconsistent with maps made from magnetotelluric readings of the area. Instead, they propose that the anomaly is linked to the region's volcanism, which has caused partial melting of the crust.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} revolutionaries, Heliade favored {{maintaining}} {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's suzerain power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures. As Sultan Abdülmecid I was assessing the situation, Süleyman Paşa was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry on with their diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by Locotenenţa domnească, a triumvirate of regents comprising Heliade, Tell, and Nicolae Golescu. Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of Regulamentul Organic and its system of government. Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> Austrian florins.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E
