40|$|The {{differences}} of learning {{experiences in the}} workplace put challenges on the assessment: the assessment programme should be aligned with the <b>general</b> <b>competency</b> <b>framework</b> of the curriculum and also fit to the differences in learning contexts of the workplace. We used van der Vleuten's programmatic assessment model to develop a workplace-based assessment programme for final year clerkships. We aimed to design a programme that stimulates learning, supports assessment decision, is feasible and non-bureaucratic. The first experiences with the programme show that students think that the programme has high learning value and the assessment is sufficiently robust. Many of the commonly reported weaknesses of work-based assessment (not a good fit with the educational context, too complex, too bureaucratic and too much work) were not mentioned by the students...|$|R

The research aim was to study the validity and reliability of this new scale. MASS items were constructed based on the end terms of the Ghent curriculum, as it is related to the <b>general</b> <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> of CanMEDs and the Five-star Doctor. The scale includes at least two items for each CanMEDS competency domain. Items were examined by seven experts in view of content and face validity. This resulted in an MASS version, containing 18 items, to be rated on a five-point Likert scale. This version was piloted on 94 undergraduate medical students enrolled at the Catholic University of Leuven. The final version was presented to 1066 undergraduate medical students enrolled at Ghent University. Reliability of the MASS scale was high (alpha = 0. 89). As expected, self-efficacy scores increased significantly over the years (F = 39. 11, p < 0. 001). In view of determining predictive validity, regression analysis was carried out to predict students' academic achievement from self-efficacy scores. As expected, MASS scores significantly predicted Maastricht Progress Test scores (F = 108. 18, p < 0. 001) ...|$|R

National and regional health education governance bodies are publishing <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> for broad implementation, while delivery organizations are developing bespoke frameworks. Currently, there is no technical specification to facilitate the exchange of <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> or competency-related data. The MedBiquitous Competencies Working Group is an international group of health educators and technologists, accredited by the American National Standards Institute. Its goal {{is to develop a}} technical specification for <b>competencies,</b> <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> and associated data. The goal is not to develop a single canonical <b>competency</b> <b>framework</b> but rather to develop a standard way of electronically publishing <b>competencies</b> and <b>frameworks.</b> Since 2005 the working group has used literature reviews, cases, discussions, surveys, reviews of published frameworks and expert consultations to conceptualize a standard way competency data may be represented electronically. This conceptualization forms the basis of the MedBiquitous Competencies Specification. The specification provides a standard way <b>competencies,</b> <b>frameworks</b> and associated data can be expressed electronically. This will facilitate rapid and broad dissemination of published frameworks, the importation of frameworks into learning or content management systems, the mapping of competencies to educational or assessment objects/activities, the cross-mapping of various <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks,</b> competency-based searches for learning events or materials, the sharing of competency-based portfolios, and other similar educational functions.

40|$|Modern {{conceptions of}} {{education}} {{are based on}} normative goals concerning learning outcomes in terms of competencies to acquire. The objective of the Swiss <b>competencies</b> <b>framework</b> was to define general and profession-specific learning outcomes for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy (ergotherapy), midwifery, nutrition counselling, and technicians in medical radiology. In addition, national authorities needed an instrument that allowed {{the integration of the}} old professional trainings into a nationally-harmonised education system and that showed the specificities of the levels (higher vocational education; bachelor and master degree at university level). While the general learning outcomes were derived from legal bases, the profession-specific learning outcomes are elaborated according to the competency-based CanMEDS framework. In the CanMEDS framework, knowledge, skills, and attitudes are condensed into meta-competencies which in turn are divided into seven roles, including the medical expert (central role). Taxonomic characteristics and indicators were elaborated in an iterative process that involved regulators, the universities of applied sciences and professional organisations. For the degree programmes mentioned above, the framework developed focuses not only on professional expertise, but also on collaboration with other health professions. Moreover, the interface-management in care taking processes is a critical success factor. Based on this conception, three levels of objectives were identified: <b>general</b> <b>competencies,</b> profession-specific learning outcomes and learning objectives to be implemented in the universities of applied sciences. The <b>general</b> <b>competencies</b> are composed of four dimensions and apply to all health professionals. The profession-specific learning outcomes for the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes are outlined with 3 to 5 indicators each in all seven professions concerned. The definition and identification of these learning outcomes allows locating the different study programmes on the correct level of tertiary education. The resulting <b>competency</b> <b>framework</b> can be applied to all health professions. The general and job-specific learning outcomes are a coherent, coordinated set of standards, which represent the objectives of Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in a differentiated way and promote inter-professional collaboration...|$|R

For this reason {{it is important that}} the <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> used to achieve competence in project organizations are effective and fit for purpose. The European Construction Institute (ECI) developed eight principles through the ACTIVE (Achieving Competitiveness Through Innovation and Value Enhancement) initiative in an attempt to add value to the delivery of projects.

A <b>competency</b> <b>framework</b> defines the skills, knowledge and attitudes required {{to carry out a}} role and serves as a solid foundation for recruitment, assessment, development and succession planning. The need to establish and implement a high quality <b>competency</b> <b>framework</b> at the point of selecting primary principals within an Irish context is vital. There has been little research undertaken in Ireland on the competencies required by school leaders to effectively run our primary schools. This study aims to address this gap. It examines the process in place for selecting and appointing primary principals within the broader context of the education system. It examines the extent to which <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> are used to support this process and it also looks at the qualifications {{on the part of those}} entrusted with overseeing this process. The preferred method of data collection for the examination of the selection process and the use of <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> was interview. The views of newly appointed principals, chairpersons of boards of management, representatives from the IPPN and CPSMA were sought for this purpose. Evidence from this study suggests that <b>competency</b> <b>frameworks</b> are not used in the process of selecting and appointing primary principals, nor is such a framework readily available to selection boards.
