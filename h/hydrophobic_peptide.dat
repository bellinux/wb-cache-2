Natural products and chemotherapeutic drugs are pumped out of the cell by P-glycoprotein in an ATP-dependent fashion. There is growing evidence that many <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>peptides</b> are also P-glycoprotein substrates. With the use of a fluorescence-quenching assay, we have shown that some linear and cyclic <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>peptides</b> interact with P-glycoprotein, whereas others do not. The measured values of the quenching constant, Kq, for interaction of peptides with P-glycoprotein ranged from 200 nM for cyclosporine A to 138 microM for the tripeptide N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. Peptides that interacted with P-glycoprotein in the fluorescence assay also blocked colchicine transport into plasma membrane vesicles from MDR cells. The values of Dm, the peptide concentration causing 50 % inhibition of drug uptake, were highly correlated with the values of Kq, over three orders of magnitude.

Depending on the nature of peptide sequence, fibril nucleation can occur in one step, straight from a dilute solution, or in multiple steps via oligomers or disordered aggregates. What determines this process is poorly understood. Since the fibril formation kinetics is driven by thermodynamic forces, knowledge of the phase behavior is crucial. Here, we investigated the phase behavior of three short peptide sequences of varying side-chain hydrophobicity. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a mid-resolution model indicate that the weakly <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>peptide</b> forms fibrils directly from solution, whereas the most <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>peptide</b> forms a dense liquid phase before crystallizing into ordered fibrils at low temperatures.
