5|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} traces of platinum {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC.

5|$|Poland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> this {{bilateral}} treaty. Ensuing tensions heightened {{until the}} outbreak of the Polish–Lithuanian War. Sejny changed hands frequently until it was controlled by Polish forces on September 22, 1920. The situation was legalized by the Suwałki Agreement of October 7, 1920, which effectively returned the town to the Polish side of the border.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in many African {{economies of}} the period, Nri did not {{practice}} slave ownership or trade. Certain parts of the Nri domain, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> slavery {{and served as a}} sanctuary.

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of the new French territory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people. Troops led by Émile Pinet-Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the Mandinka Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{governing}} {{of skiing}} in Canada was {{split between the}} Canadian Amateur Ski Association (CASA) and the Western Canada Amateur Ski Association (WCASA). Nelsen was the latter's president, and after years of rivalry, which even {{reached the point where}} they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> each other, Nelsen eventually was part of the negotiation for an amalgamation which took into consideration the needs of the western clubs. Nelsen subsequently became vice-president of CASA from 1934.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> {{it at the}} time, they were finding the remains of {{juvenile}} Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|As the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the East, Kentucky's {{settlers}} became involved in a dispute about the region's sovereignty. Richard Henderson, a judge and land speculator from North Carolina, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania, but many Kentucky settlers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> Transylvania's authority over them. In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the legitimacy of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories {{which had been}} lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond because they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> him; had they recognized him, they would have saved him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} Allen Barra's Inventing Wyatt Earp. His Life and Many Legends, William Urban, a Professor of History at Monmouth College in Warren County, Illinois, {{pointed out}} a number of factual inaccuracies in the book. One inconsistency by Barra, pointed out by another reviewer, includes a description of the poker game the night before the shootout. Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize,</b> while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to The Guardian began at 5 pm.|$|E

NJPW <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> Angle as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, instead it viewed Angle as the second IWGP 3rd Belt Champion.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} to mediate between Buenos Aires and the Federal League led by Artigas. He {{thought that the}} civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities would free resources needed for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Martín {{proposed to}} defeat the royalists first and then demand {{the return of the}} Eastern Bank to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Martín might be captured. Pueyrredón rejected the mediation, as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The Lithuanians claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the Lithuanians had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E
5|$|Upon June Byers's {{retirement}} in 1956, {{it was held}} primarily (and operated) by Lillian Ellison under her ring name, The Fabulous Moolah, who first won the championship in a battle royal in September 1956. In 1983, the title was sold by Ellison to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where it became the WWF Women's Championship. The World Wrestling Federation recognized Moolah as the reigning champion but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> any of the title changes that had occurred since Moolah was first awarded the title. The NWA continued the title without Moolah after her title was renamed the WWF Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.|$|E
