Alcohols are most effective when combined with distilled water to facilitate diffusion through the cell membrane; 100% alcohol typically denatures only external membrane proteins. [...] A mixture of 70% ethanol or isopropanol diluted in water is effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, though higher concentrations are often needed to disinfect wet surfaces. [...] Additionally, high-concentration mixtures (such as 80% ethanol + 5% isopropanol) are required to effectively inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses (such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C). [...] The efficacy of alcohol is enhanced when in solution with the wetting agent <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (coconut soap). The synergistic effect of 29.4% ethanol with <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

40|$|Summary. The work {{reported}} here {{is motivated by}} questions relating to the perception of olfactory cues in the discrimination of nestmates and kin in the honeybee Apis mellifera. Two sets of experi-ments are discussed. The first deals with the per-ception of individual compounds in mixtures made up from various pairs of volatile (citral, geraniol, linalool, and limonene) and nonvolatile (un- and <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> compounds. The second deals with the ability of worker honeybees to discrimi-nate between mixtures made up from the same two compounds (un- and dodecanoic acids; tri- and pentacosane) combined in different proportions. All experiments employ differential conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex as an assay of the ability of workers to discriminate between two odors.

Of these fatty acids, <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was the most effective, with 50 % lysis occurring in about 30 min at a concentration of 0. 5 mM.

40|$|How {{fatty acids}} stimulate enteroendocrine cells to release {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) is largely unknown. Recently, we {{proposed that the}} murine enteroendocrine cell line, STC- 1, responds to insoluble fatty acid aggregates rather than fatty acid monomers in solution. This hypothesis led to two testable predictions. First, other insoluble particles of similar size but unrelated to fatty acid {{may be able to}} stimulate STC- 1 cells in a similar fashion to <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and second, fatty acid sensing in STC- 1 cells should be fairly insensitive to chemical modifications of the fatty acid as long as these modifications do not greatly alter the ability of the molecule to form insoluble aggregates. We used several analogues of <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and several varieties of latex microsphere (varying in size and surface charge) to see whether the predictions of our model hold. We found that while there was at least one latex microsphere that could induce CCK secretion and calcium mobilisation in STC- 1 cells, there was a very poor correlation between the presence of insoluble aggregates and a cellular response. Instead the most important property, determining the potency of fatty acid analogues as stimulants of CCK secretion, was their amphipathicity. Removal of either the polar head or lipophilic tail completely abolished the ability of a given fatty acid analogue to stimulate STC- 1 cells. These data suggested that while fatty acids can stimulate cells as aggregates, they may also be acting in monomeric form with the oil:water partitioning coefficient playing a crucial role. We finally resolved this issue with the observation that the sulfate ion greatly altered the response of STC- 1 cells to monomeric <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the presence of sulfate, STC- 1 cells will only respond to <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> aggregates whereas when sulfate is replaced with chloride the cells clearly respond to <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> monomers which are completely in solution. In summary, we propose that <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> can stimulate STC- 1 cells via two separate pathways one involving fatty acid monomers in solution and one involving fatty acid aggregates. Which pathway dominates depends on the presence of sulfate in the extracellular medium...|$|E

Several reaction parameters were evaluated including the type and amount of enzyme, acyl donor, and organic solvent, as well as the influence of water and the recyclability of the catalyst. When Candida antarctica lipase (CAL-B) was used, the acylation was highly regioselective and the corresponding 5 -acyl-d-ribono- 1, 4 -lactones were observed as the sole product. The best conversion (> 99 %) into 5 -acetyl-d-ribono- 1, 4 -lactone was obtained through the combination of vinyl acetate as the acetyl donor and 10 mg (100 U) of CAL-B in dry acetonitrile after 24 h.

These spirits, which are a valuable by-product of the winemaking industry, are obtained via steam-distillation of grape pomace after storage under anaerobic conditions for a given period of time. An impetus for this research is the increasingly strict European legal standards pertaining to the levels of health hazard volatile compounds (e. g., methanol) {{and the lack of}} comprehensive studies on this topic for Portuguese bagaceiras. Assays were performed by gas/liquid chromatography for alcohols (methanol, 2 -butanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -methyl-propanol, allylic alcohol, 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, hexanol,trans- 3 -hexenol,cis- 3 -hexenol,trans- 2 -hexenol, and 2 -phenyl-ethanol), carboxylic acids (isobutyric, isovaleric, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, and <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acids),</b> esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, diethyl succinate, 2 -phenyl-ethyl-acetate, and ethyl dodecanoate), as well as for an aldehyde (ethanal) and its acetal (diethoxy- 1 - 1 -ethane). The average values obtained for Portuguese bagaceiras(and the corresponding ranges) were comparable with corresponding values for grape pomaces manufactured in other Mediterranean countries (viz.

40|$|Colorectal pathologies are {{diseases}} {{that affect the}} large intestine and they include polyposis, ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. In correspondence to these pathologies some authors observed an altered expression of the fatty-acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme appointed to the endogenous biosynthesis of fatty acids. Thus, the investigation of FAS metabolites could give a snap-shot of the physiological state of the organism. From preliminary studies, increased levels of decanoic acid seemed related {{to the presence of}} colorectal cancer. For this reason, in this study medium-chain fatty acids have been determined in plasma samples of different kinds of patients using fast gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer with TOF analyzer. In particular, four groups of subjects have been considered: 25 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 11 ulcerative colitis patients (RCU), 10 breast cancer patients (MAM) and 17 healthy subjects (C). For every plasma sample, levels of hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic and <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acids</b> have been quantified in order to highlight some differences in concentrations of some of them in specific groups of subjects. For the quantitation, calibration curves have been built using standard solutions of the analytes and resorting to the internal standard method (using d 3 - 8, 8, 8 -octanoic acid as internal standard). Samples have been added with a known amount of internal standard and, later, fatty acids have been extracted by a mixture of methanol/chloroform 1 : 2, adding an NaCl solution to favour proteins aggregation. Thereafter, treated samples have been centrifugated in order to separate proteins from liquids and aqueous phase from the organic one. Aqueous phase has been eliminated while organic phase has been collected and the analytes therein have been concentrated. Standard solutions and extracted samples have been derivatized before the GC analysis and every sample has been analyzed twice. The method used for this study, fast GC-MS, has been validated following the guidelines recommended by FDA and EMEA and it has proved accurate, precise, characterized by a wide linear dynamic range and by relatively low values of detection and quantitation limits. From chromatograms and by means of calibration curves, medium-chain fatty acids have been quantified in every plasma sample, and the results have been submitted to statistical tests. Obtained data have showed a statistical difference in decanoic acid concentration in colorectal cancer patients with respect of other groups, suggesting a possible correlation between the increment of this fatty acid and CRC. The study has also pointed out that there is an increment of the concentrations of both hexanoic and <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acids</b> in correspondence to ulcerative colitis. The obtained results require the analysis of a greater number of samples in order to confirm the observed concentration differences. In addition, a further investigation on the biological causes of these altered lipid profiles is necessary to reach a whole understanding of biochemical processes that occur in the presence of colorectal diseases. ...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acid-induced {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) secretion {{in humans}} {{and from the}} enteroendocrine cell line STC- 1 depends critically on acyl chain length. Therefore we have characterized the relationship between acyl chain length and the potency of the fatty acid to induce CCK secretion and changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in two enteroendocrine cell lines (STC- 1 and GLUTag). We found that the potency of the fatty acid was directly proportional to its chain length and therefore inversely proportional to its solubility. In both cell types, the fatty acid-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i in response to decanoic acid (C 10), <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 12) and tetradecanoic acid (C 14) was significantly reduced in Ca 2 +-free medium and largely blocked by nicardipine. Intracellular stores {{also contributed to the}} overall shape of the [Ca 2 +]i peak. Thus all the fatty acids tested caused the release of Ca 2 + from stores and influx of extracellular Ca 2 +, presumably through L-type calcium channels. To probe the site of fatty acid action, we studied the distribution of 14 C-labelled <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> This label was rapidly and irreversibly accumulated by both cell types, where it became concentrated about 20 -fold. Confocal microscopy of a fluorescent analogue of <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> clearly demonstrated that it entered the cytosol and was not merely partitioning in the cell membrane. These data indicate that an intracellular action for fatty acid-induced CCK secretion cannot be eliminated. <b>Dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> itself, and not a metabolite, is the agent responsible for triggering Ca 2 + entry since a non-metabolizable form of <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (2 -bromododecanoic acid) was also capable of inducing a rise in [Ca 2 +]i in both cell types. In conclusion, the rise in [Ca 2 +]i in STC- 1 and GLUTag cells evoked by medium- to long-chain fatty acids results from the triggering of a specific signalling pathway. Whether triggering occurs through activation of a membrane-bound receptor or at an intracellular site remains to be clarified...|$|E

40|$|Lipopeptide {{detergents}} (LPDs) are a {{new class}} of amphiphile designed specifically for the structural study of integral membrane proteins. The LPD monomer consists of a 25 -residue peptide with fatty acyl chains linked to side chains located at positions 2 and 24 of the peptide. LPDs are designed to form alpha-helices that self-assemble into cylindrical micelles, providing a more natural interior acyl chain packing environment relative to traditional detergents. We have determined the crystal structure of LPD- 12, an LPD coupled to two <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> to a resolution of 1. 20 A. The LPD- 12 monomers adopt the target conformation and associate into cylindrical octamers as expected. Pairs of helices are strongly associated as Alacoil-type antiparallel dimers, and four of these dimers interact through much looser contacts into assemblies with approximate D(2) symmetry. The aligned helices form a cylindrical shell with a hydrophilic exterior that protects an interior hydrophobic cavity containing the 16 LPD acyl chains. Over 90 % of the methylene/methyl groups from the acylated side chains are visible in the micelle interiors, and approximately 90 % of these adopt trans dihedral angle conformations. Dodecylmaltoside (DDM) was required for the crystallization of LPD- 12, and we find 10 - 24 ordered DDM molecules associated with each LPD assembly, resulting in an overall micelle molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa. The structures confirm the major design objectives of the LPD framework, and reveal unexpected features that will be helpful in the engineering additional versions of lipopeptide amphiphiles. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

One of these fractions (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 1) was highly purified to a specific content of 17 nmol of cytochrome P- 450 /mg of protein and the protein was active in a reconstituted enzyme system towards the 12 - and 11 -hydroxylation of the fatty <b>acid,</b> <b>dodecanoic</b> (lauric) <b>acid,</b> with preferential activity towards the 12 -hydroxy metabolite. This reconstituted activity was absolutely dependent on NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase and cytochrome P- 450, indicating the role of the mixed-function oxidase system in the metabolism of lauric acid. Another fraction of the haemoprotein (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 2) preferentially formed 11 -hydroxylauric acid, whereas a third fraction (cytochrome P- 450 fraction 3) exhibited only trace laurate oxidase activity and was similar to the phenobarbitone form of the haemoprotein in that these last two cytochromes rapidly turned-over the drug benzphetamine.

The orientation occurs within the magnetic field upon cooling the system from its higher-temperature isotropic phase: the lipid cylinders of the hexagonal phase become oriented parallel to the field. This is shown by solid-state NMR using either perdeuterated fatty acids or ethanolamine. This system bears strong interest for studying host protonated molecules but also in materials chemistry for building oriented solid materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of fatty acids on ileal absorption of water, electrolytes, glucose, and taurocholate was examined in Thirty-Vella fistulas in five mongrel dogs. Fatty acid absorption also was measured. Segments of terminal ileum were perfused at steady state with isotonic electrolyte solutions containing 11. 2 mM glucose, 4. 5 mM taurocholate, and 0. 1 - 5. 0 mM fatty acid. Three C 18 fatty acids, oleic acid, 10 (9) -hydroxystearic acid, and ricinoleic acid, completely inhibited water absorption at 5 mM. Sodium, chloride, and potassium absorptions were inhibited {{in parallel with}} absorption of water. Differences between the potencies of C 18 fatty acids were apparent when lesser concentrations were perfused. <b>Dodecanoic</b> and decanoic <b>acids</b> were as effective as C 18 fatty acids at 5 mM but octanoic and hexanoic acids were ineffective. The polar group of C 18 fatty acids was modified by conjugating oleic and ricinoleic acids with taurine. When these compounds and a substituted C 18 fatty acid, p-n-decylbenzenesulfonate, were perfused, water absorption was also inhibited. Short-chain fatty acids (C 3 and C 4) and their hydroxylated derivatives were ineffective at 5 mM. When water absorption was inhibited, absorption of glucose and taurocholate was decreased. We speculate that the phenomenon of inhibition of water and electrolyte absorption by fatty acids may be relevant to steatorrhea and diarrhea in man...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNatural {{products}} are among {{one of the}} most promising fields in finding new molecular targets in cancer therapy. Laryngeal carcinoma is {{one of the most}} common cancers affecting the head and neck regions, and is associated with high morbidity rate if left untreated. The aim of this study was to examine the antiproliferative effect of Araucaria angustifolia on laryngeal carcinoma HEp- 2 cells. The results showed that A. angustifolia extract (AAE) induced a significant cytotoxicity in HEp- 2 cells compared to the non-tumor human epithelial (HEK- 293) cells, indicating a selective activity of AAE for the cancer cells. A. angustifolia extract was able to increase oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and the production of nitric oxide, along with the depletion of enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in the tumor cell line. Moreover, AAE was able to induce DNA damage, nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation. A significant increase in the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF), Bax, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase- 3 cleavage expression were also found. These effects could be related to the ability of AAE to increase the production of reactive oxygen species through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I activity and ATP production by the tumor cells. The phytochemical analysis of A. angustifolia, performed using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) in MS and MS/MS mode, showed the presence of <b>dodecanoic</b> and hexadecanoic <b>acids,</b> and phenolic compounds, which may be associated with the chemotherapeutic effect observed in this study...|$|R

Thus, <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was detected. In addition, a diterminal oxidation was observed supported by the detection of hexandioic acid. A similar study with Candida rugosa and decane indicated a mono- and diterminal oxidation as well (Mizuno et al. [1966]).|$|E

40|$|Cladosporium (Amorphotheca) resinae {{was grown}} in shake culture on glucose, n-dodecane, or n-hexadecane. Growth was most rapid on glucose, and more acid {{accumulated}} {{in the medium}} than in n-alkane-grown cultures. Neutral lipid was the major lipid fraction and triglycerides were the only extracellular neutral lipids detected. Dodecanoic (lauric) acid was the predominant fatty acid (> 60 %) in neutral lipids from all three media, with lesser amounts of tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and octadecanoic acids. Extracellular phospholipids identified were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin or a cardiolipin-like compound. Phospholipids from all three media contained <b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> as their principle fatty acid. <b>Dodecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was the only extracellular free fatty acid detected. Glucose medium contained acetic, glyoxylic, and glycolic acids and an unidentified organic acid which {{may contribute to the}} lower pH in cultures after growth on glucose. In all classes of extracellular lipids the fatty acids do not correspond to the fatty acids previously determined to be associated with cellular lipids. Moreover, the fatty acids of extracellular lipids do not reflect the chain length of the n-alkane growth substrate...|$|E
40|$|To {{optimize}} {{conditions to}} prepare a good quality of enzyme-modified cheese (EMC), EMC samples were prepared by using combinations of Neutrase RTM/Lactobacillus casei enzymes, Neutrase RTM/Debitrase(TM), NeutraseRTM/Flavorzyme(TM) and NeutraseRTM/PalataseRTM. Based on the results obtained from sensory and RP-HPLC analysis, the optimal combinations {{to prepare a}} good quality of EMC were found to be: NeutraseRTM with (I) L. casei enzymes (aminopeptidase activity 86. 4 LAPU/g and esterase activity 110. 0 U/g), (II) Debitrase(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 22. 0 LAPU/g), (III) Flavorzyme(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 6. 5 LAPU/g), and (IV) PalataseRTM M (lipase activity 200 LU/g). The water-soluble fractions of EMCs prepared with different enzyme combinations were subjected to RP-HPLC on a Delta Pack C 18 column, and selected peaks were purified on the same column using a binary gradient. One peak from NeutraseRTM digest, five peaks from NeutraseRTM /Debitrase(TM) digest, and two peaks from NeutraseRTM /L. casei enzyme digest were purified and identified by API mass spectrometry. All the purified peptides contained active sites within their sequences. The volatile compounds {{in a series of}} EMCs prepared by L. casei and commercial enzymes as well as Cheddar cheese (mild, old, extra old) were also identified by using Pyrolysis/GC/MS and dynamic headspace techniques. Overall, 5 ketones, 8 fatty acids, 3 alcohols and 2 aldehydes were detected in most of the samples using Py/GC/MS. Propanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, <b>dodecanoic</b> and tetradecanoic <b>acids</b> were found to be the major fatty acids present in EMC prepared by L. casei enzymes. Dynamic headspace analysis revealed the presence of 17 compounds including fatty acids, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, and hydrocarbon in most of the sample analyzed. The flavor of EMC seems to depend not on any particular key component, but rather on a critical balance of all components present...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{have been performed}} on solid inclusion compounds formed between urea and alkane (dodecane) and alkanoic acid (<b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> guest molecules. The incommensurate nature of the guest and host substructures means that simulations of these systems are challenging, and our results call into question some of the simplifying assumptions made in earlier simulations on the urea inclusion compounds. Detailed information is obtained on the structural properties of the carboxylic acid dimers and alkyl chains confined within the nanoscale tunnels of the urea host structure, including the chirality of the guest conformation induced by the chiral nature of the urea tunnels. Diffusion coefficients (at 300 K) of the guest molecules along the tunnel axis were determined to be 0. 091 ± 0. 031 (dodecane) and 0. 0063 ± 0. 0013 Å 2 ps− 1 (<b>dodecanoic</b> <b>acid),</b> in good agreement with experimental measurements on alkane/urea systems. Weak ordering is observed between guests in neighboring tunnels, which is compatible with experimental measurements on the alkane/urea systems, although the simulations provide more detailed molecular-level insights {{into the nature of}} this supramolecular ordering...|$|E
