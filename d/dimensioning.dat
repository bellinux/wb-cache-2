2500|$|Blomstedt was the {{key figure}} here, {{as one of the}} {{founding}} figures of the Museum of Finnish Architecture, professor of architecture theory at Helsinki University of Technology, editor of the main Finnish architecture journal Arkkitehti (Finnish Architecture Review), and as a key member of the Helsinki branch of CIAM he helped create in 1958 Le Carré Bleu, a journal of architecture theory published originally solely in French (so that it would come {{to the attention of the}} key players in CIAM). The focus of the journal was on a strict formalism and morphology. Among its articles, the journal featured Blomstedt's own studies in geometric proportion and <b>dimensioning</b> systems, inspired just as much by harmonic systems devised by Swiss mathematician Hans Kayser as Le Corbusier's studies of proportional systems. One of Blomstedt's key works, the extension to the Finnish Language Adult Education Centre, Helsinki (1959) (the main building, from 1927, had been designed by Gunnar Taucher together with Blomstedt's older brother Pauli E. Blomstedt) was an application of this research, with the entire building based on subdivisions of a basic 360mm module (5x72, 3x120 and 2x180mm). Indeed, the crux of Blomstedt's approach was the development of a <b>dimensioning</b> and proportional system for architectural design that, he argued, was in harmony with the laws of nature and beauty (human scale and musical harmony) while also providing a standard system for the mass industrialisation of building, which was regarded as central to the efficacy of modernism. One of Blomstedt's proportional experiments, from 1973, even became the logo for the Museum of Finnish Architecture.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, {{effective}} <b>dimension</b> is {{a modification}} of Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> and other fractal <b>dimensions</b> which places it in a computability theory setting. There are several variations (various notions of effective <b>dimension)</b> of which the most common is effective Hausdorff <b>dimension.</b> <b>Dimension,</b> in mathematics, is a particular way of describing {{the size of an}} object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> generalizes the well-known integer <b>dimensions</b> assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, fractal subsets of the plane may have intermediate <b>dimension</b> between 1 and 2, as they are [...] "larger" [...] than lines or curves, and yet [...] "smaller" [...] than filled circles or rectangles. Effective <b>dimension</b> modifies Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> by requiring that objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> also have large effective <b>dimension,</b> and objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> have small Hausdorff <b>dimension,</b> but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective <b>dimension.</b> An example is an algorithmically random point on a line, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 0 (since it is a point) but effective <b>dimension</b> 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 1).|$|R
