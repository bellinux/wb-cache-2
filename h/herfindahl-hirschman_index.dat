5000|$|First it is {{necessary}} to determine whether a company is dominant, or whether it behaves [...] "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer". As with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the company and product in question is sold. The <b>Herfindahl-Hirschman</b> <b>Index</b> (HHI) is sometimes used to assess how competitive an industry is.

5000|$|The Herfindahl index (also {{known as}} <b>Herfindahl-Hirschman</b> <b>Index,</b> HHI, or {{sometimes}} HHI-score) {{is a measure}} of the size of firms in relation to the industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust and also technology management. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares of the firms within the industry (sometimes limited to the 50 largest firms), where the market shares are expressed as fractions. The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite. Alternatively, if whole percentages are used, the index ranges from 0 to 10,000 [...] "points". For example, an index of [...]25 is the same as 2,500 points.|$|E

While there are large companies in most financial marketplace segments, the national insurance marketplace is spread among thousands of companies, and the barriers to entry in a business where capital is the primary input are relatively minor. The policies of one homeowners insurer can be relatively easily substituted for another or picked up by a state residual market provider, with limits on the underwriting fluidity primarily stemming from state-by-state regulatory impediments, such as limits on pricing and capital mobility. During the recent financial crisis, the collapse of the American International Group (AIG) posed a significant systemic risk to the financial system. There are arguably either no or extremely few insurers that are TBTF in the U.S. marketplace.|$|E
50|$|The FCC {{created this}} tool to help {{identify}} markets where cross-ownership limits should be retained. The index {{was based on the}} <b>Herfindahl-Hirschman</b> <b>Index</b> (HHI), which is used by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to measure market concentration. It is commonly used to assess a merger’s effect on competition in a market. HHI is calculated by summing the squares of each firm's share of a given market. Therefore, a highly competitive market will have a lower score. Included in the Diversity Index are broadcast television, newspapers, radio, and internet. Based purely on popularity of each media source, the FCC assigned broadcast TV 33.8%, newspapers 20.2%, weekly periodicals 8.6%, radio 24.9%, cable internet 2.3%, and all other internet 10.2%. Within each media type, the number of outlets were assigned an equal market share. The summation of all media types for each owner was then squared and added to the index. Scores were determined for all markets with five or fewer television stations, all markets with 15 to 20 television stations, and ten randomly selected markets with between six and ten stations. The FCC then considered what would happen to scores under different ownership limit scenarios. In small sized markets, scores dramatically increased, showing the need for greater control. Due to events of the eventual court case, the Diversity Index never went into effect.|$|E

These control variables serve as a basis to study the impact of regulation and competition on risk. The Polynomics regulatory index is used for regulation and <b>Herfindahl-Hirschman</b> <b>Indexes</b> for competition. The overall index of regulation doesn't have a clear impact on risk. However, subindexes indicating quantity regulation is associated with higher risk. By quantity, we mean regulatory constraints such as Universal service obligation or coverage obligation for mobile networks. In contrast, access regulation decreases the risk. The impact of the competition's intensity is different for the mobile and fixed markets.

5000|$|The FCC issued {{sweeping}} changes through the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This included major {{changes to the}} guidelines that determined who {{would be eligible for}} ownership of media outlets. The restrictions of cross ownership were greatly relaxed, which made it even more difficult for minorities to financially compete with the growing conglomerates who were amassing media outlets. The FCC determined “that the existing rules were no longer in the public interest, repealed them, and replaced them with a single set of Cross-Media Limits using a methodological tool called the Diversity Index." [...] This decision was based on treating media ownership like many business entities in a market situation where the government only has an interest to keep a competitive and free market. This would be presuming that all voices represented an equal possible strength, as in a business situation where each producer of a similar commodity has an equal chance of success and all will serve the market equally.

We analyze the spatial structure and dynamics of 43 technology fields (ISI-SPRU-OST concordance) and 6 high-technology fields based on data on EPO patent applications and EPO inventors for the reference period 1977 - 2004. Based upon OECD RegPAT database (January 2009), we extract EPO patent applications (fractional counting) and inventor IDs (full counting), which are spatially linked to 819 European micro regions (OECD TL 3), covering the EU- 25, Switzerland and Norway.

Accepting these finding as true, we hypothesized that decreasing marginal effects may occur in the associations between the built environments and walking. The {{purpose of this study was}} as follows: (1) to empirically test whether a non-linear relationship between the two exists, and (2) to identify the threshold of the built environment characteristics that promote walking. Using the 2012 Seoul Metropolitan Household Travel Survey, this study analyzed 411, 899 individuals' travel behaviors and their neighborhood environments. We calculated the population and street densities, and the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschman</b> <b>Indexes</b> (HHI) of 1107 administrative units located within the study area. The results of multilevel logit and linear models showed that these built environment characteristics had a non-linear relationship with the occurrence and duration of walking. The positive association with taking walking trips and negative association with taking private vehicle trips were greatly reduced where gross density reaches beyond 9132 - 16, 101 persons/km(2). The positive influence of land-use mixture and street connectivity also showed that the marginal number and duration of walking indicated a sharp decline at a certain intensity of those characteristics. The findings of the study imply that thresholds of density, street connectivity, and land-use mixture levels that promote walking may exist within the existing context of the study area. We hope that the findings of our study provide useful guidelines for those attempting to developing walkable communities by modifying the characteristics of the built environment.
