50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> is a valve which {{essentially}} {{creates a}} back-pressure in the exhaust system, which applies enough force onto the engine's pistons {{to slow the}} engine. In most cases, an <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> is so effective that it can slow a heavily-loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicleâ€™s service brakes. Under these conditions, the exhaust flow from the cylinders is bottlenecked and rapidly builds pressure in the exhaust system upstream from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake.</b> Depending on engine speed, this pressure can easily reach up to 60 PSI maximum working pressure. Maximum working pressure is limited {{as part of the}} design of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake.</b> In this example, that same 60 PSI also remains in the cylinder for the entire exhaust stroke (exhaust valve open) and exerts 60 PSI on the piston top to resist its upward movement. The produces a negative torque, slowing the engine for a braking effect. Thus, simply restricting the exhaust flow can generate substantial braking.|$|E

50|$|The {{compression}} stroke is used next to utilise the back pressure in exhaust where at the piston's Bottom Dead Centre the exhaust valve are opened briefly and high pressure in exhaust manifold is than let in acting against the piston moving upwards on its {{compression stroke}} thus slowing {{it even more}} explanation needed, <b>exhaust</b> <b>braking</b> functions in relation to cylinder pressure, not piston speed and increasing the engine braking effect.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Honda America's {{accessories}} division {{teamed up}} with Comptech, a respected tuner {{with a long history}} of collaboration with the company. Utilizing a specially designed Eaton supercharger coupled with numerous suspension, <b>exhaust,</b> <b>braking</b> and drivetrain modifications, Comptech was able to significantly improve the capabilities of an already powerful CL Type S. With the modifications, 0 to 60 times of the coupe were reduced from 6.0 seconds on a stock Type S to a mere 5.7 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exhaust stroke}} is used when <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> shutter closes exhaust {{manifold}} after turbocharger opening {{as a result}} exhaust back pressure is raised creating braking effect.|$|E
50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a device}} that {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the exhaust system, and creates substantial exhaust back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> is so effective that it can slow a heavily loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. Exhaust brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced exhaust brakes have exhaust pressure modulation (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> {{works by}} causing a {{restriction}} in the exhaust, {{much like the}} intake throttle causes in a gasoline engine. In simple terms, it works by increasing the back-pressure of the exhaust. Nearly all of these brakes are butterfly valves similar to a throttle valve, mounted downstream of the turbocharger if there is one.|$|E

50|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>brakes</b> are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine <b>brake.</b> Essentially, the <b>exhaust</b> pipe {{of the vehicle}} is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the exhaust system, forcing the engine to work harder on the exhaust stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the exhaust pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of exhaust gas can also help in increasing the exhaust pressure {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the {{compression}} stroke just before piston's Top Dead Centre exhaust valves are open briefly again to release [...] "bleed" [...] compression thus again slowing the piston on its subsequent downwards movement and consequently achieving engine braking effect while also storing the pressure in the exhaust manifold again using the <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> shutter ready for the next repeat of the cycle.|$|E
50|$|An <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{means of}} slowing a diesel engine by closing off the exhaust path from the engine, causing the exhaust gases to be {{compressed}} in the exhaust manifold, and in the cylinder. Since the exhaust is being compressed, and there is no fuel being applied, the engine works backwards, slowing down the vehicle. The amount of negative torque generated is usually directly proportional to the back pressure of the engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{is commonly}} used to improve power and reduce fuel consumption ratio. Study on effect of turbocharger on <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> for diesel engines had practical significance.When butterfly valve is closed, in the exhaust manifold there is no exhaust emissions so the turbine blades of the turbocharger cannot work, but because turbine blades has the blocking effect, and this effect can make lower inlet pressure of the diesel engine than it with no turbocharger, so air intake into the engine reduces which not only reduces the fuel consumption but also speed of the engine.|$|E

5000|$|Engine design {{follows the}} rest of the Volvo engines where timing gears are located at the rear, which allows for better air flow around engine area. The engine also comes with {{integrated}} engine brake available in two versions, either a stand alone butterfly type <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> or with a JAK integrated compression brake from Jacobs Vehicle System. This, the so-called [...] "bleeder" [...] brake, is a simplified version of a traditional Jake compression brake. The total braking output is [...] at 2800 rpm for exhaust unit and up to [...] at 2800 rpm for the compression brake.|$|E

50|$|Another braking {{feature of}} semi-trucks is engine braking, {{which could be}} either a {{compression}} brake (usually shortened to Jake brake) or <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> or combination of both. However, the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the planning, {{design and construction}} of a permeable pavement as a practical demonstration {{of the benefits of}} eco-paving in Australian environmental management. The paper addresses the use of permeable pavements as part of a Water Sensitive Urban Design that allows infiltration of stormwater, reduction of pollutants and slow reticulation of the stormwater to an ecologically sensitive water system. Management of {{the quantity and quality of}} urban stormwater run-off is a major concern for government authorities. The increase in impervious surfaces associated with urbanisation of catchments results in an increase in the volumes of stormwater runoff that must be handled by the stormwater drainage systems and a consequent increase in the ability of the stormwater runoff to transport pollutants from the catchment surface to the downstream receiving waters. These pollutants include those from vehicle <b>exhausts,</b> <b>brakes</b> and tyres, community activities, and atmospheric deposition. Where the stormwater system drains to ecologically sensitive zones, such as beaches, lakes or creeks, communities demand that the quality of the stormwater discharged into these water bodies must not lead to their degradation...|$|R
5000|$|More vacuum {{is created}} in some situations. On {{deceleration}} or when descending a hill, the throttle {{will be closed}} and a low gear selected to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit {{the speed of the}} engine. This phenomenon, known as engine braking, is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking {{should not be confused with}} compression braking (aka a [...] "Jake brake"), or with <b>exhaust</b> <b>braking,</b> which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The Volvo FL6 {{is powered}} by Volvoâ€™s D6B 180-250 hp, six-cylinder {{turbocharged}} intercooled diesel engine. The control system had a major update, with Volvo's TEA electronics architecture {{to bring it to}} line with the rest of its bigger cousins. Inline fuel injection pump was replaced with the EDC rotary distributor pump from Bosch with the identical horsepower; despite the loss of supercharger from the previous D6A engine. The cruise control, automatic <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> and accelerator now became the so-called fly by wire as standard. Full integration {{with the rest of the}} vehicle system such as Electronic Suspension Control and ABS made it much more efficient and user friendly.|$|E

5000|$|Another use for {{the sliding}} vane type of {{turbocharger}} is as downstream engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>brake</b> (non-decompression-type), so that an extra exhaust throttle valve is not needed (turbo brake).
