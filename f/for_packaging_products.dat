40|$|Vertical form–fill–seal (VFFS) {{machines}} {{are widely used}} to form bags <b>for</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>products</b> such as confectionary and snack food. One critical component of the machine is the forming shoulder, which needs to manipulate, without damage, the packaging material from a flat state into a tube. Some models of the geometry of the shoulder are available and {{have been used to}} help with its design and manufacture. However, there currently exists no theoretical basis for determining the geometry of the forming shoulder needed to process particular packaging materials. This paper investigates the application of Euler's theory for material flow around cylinders to the case of forming shoulders used in vertical form–fill–seal systems. It is shown that the theory is indeed applicable, and an inequality relation between the measured coefficient of friction of the material and the forming shoulder parameters is established. It is further shown how this can be used to direct the design of a forming shoulder for a particular application...|$|E
30|$|As {{artificial}} intelligence became {{popular in the}} 1980 s, a new approach was introduced for construction cost estimation, while several studies employed different methods to estimate the costs {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Later, in the 1990 s, neural networks (NNs) as a branch of {{artificial intelligence}} were employed as an alternative to estimate construction costs. This method does not require the determination of a cost estimating function that mathematically relates the cost to the variables with the most effect on the cost. A feature-based neural network (NN) for modelling cost estimation was developed by Zhang et al. (1996) <b>for</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>products.</b> Shtub and Versano (1999) compared the performances of NNs and regression analysis when they estimate the construction cost of a steel-pipe-bending process. Gwang and Sung-Hoon (2004) investigated the accuracies of several cost estimation methods such as multiple regression analysis (MRA), NNs, and case-based reasoning (CBR) based on 530 available historical construction costs from residential buildings. General contractors conducted these projects between 1997 and 2000 in Seoul, Korea. CBR is a methodology that received an increasing attention to make cost estimation during the early phases of a project. The existing knowledge is exploited by this method to make better estimations compared with the case without its use. De Soto and Adey (2015) investigated the CBR reasoning retrieval process to estimate resources in construction projects. Cavalieri et al. (2004) compared parametric and NN models for the estimation of production costs and concluded that NN performs better and is more reliable. Kim et al. (2004) employed a back-propagation neural-network (BPNN) approach combined with genetic algorithms (GAs) to estimate construction costs of residential buildings. The aim of using GAs in their work was to determine the BPNN’s parameters and to improve the accuracy of the estimation. Murat and Ceylan (2006) implemented an artificial neural-network (ANN) process to estimate the cost of energy transportation. Verlinden et al. (2008) developed MRA and ANN-based models to estimate the cost of a sheet metal production. Wang et al. (2013) developed a cost estimator model based on NN. The learning procedure of his NN was completed by means of a particle-swarm optimization algorithm. Zima (2015) presented an approach to estimate the unit price of construction elements with the use of the CBR method. The CBR system presents a knowledge base that supports the cost estimation at the early stage of a construction project.|$|E
