25|$|The {{scheme was}} opposed during the {{consultation}} phase by {{a range of}} stake holders: The Freight Transport Association proposed an alternative scheme, reliant on a replacement cycle of vehicles, with lorries over 8 years old being liable, with higher years for other vehicles. They also stated that the standards were different from the forthcoming Euro5 requirements as well suggesting the scheme did not <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> reduce CO2 emissions. The Road Haulage Association opposed the scheme, stating the costs to hauliers and benefits to the environment did not justify its introduction. Schools and St.John Ambulance have {{expressed concern about the}} additional costs that the scheme will bring them, particularly in light of the restricted budgets they operate under. London First, a business organisation, criticised aspects of the scheme with relation to the categorisation of vehicles, but supported the principle. The scheme has been supported by the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW's [...] "no-concession" [...] stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that [...] "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> itself to begin with", since they [...] "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades". Kelly McParland, {{a columnist for the}} National Post, has suggested that [...] "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." [...] He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labour alike, criticizing labour for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).|$|E
