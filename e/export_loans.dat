40|$|In 2001, {{the gross}} {{domestic}} product (GDP) growth rate of the Indonesian economy was 3. 3 %, which was considerably lower than the 4. 8 % of 2000. Except for the mining and quarrying sector, other industrial sectors posted a positive growth. The mining and quarrying sector accounted for 13. 6 % of the GDP, 1, 491. 0 trillion rupiahs ($ 145 billion). The per capita GDP based on 2001 prices was 7. 2 million rupiahs ($ 702) (Bank Indonesia, 2002, p. 34; Central Bureau of Statistics, 2002). Besides the deterioration of the world economy, the slow improvement of loan and corporate restructuring in Indonesia also contributed to the decline. Economic growth was pushed by private and government consumption expenditures. Private consumption rose by 6 % in 2001, which was the sharpest rise since 1997. Export trade, which was the engine of growth in 2000, declined by 9. 3 % in 2001 compared with 16. 1 % growth in 2000. The low level of investment, an increase of only 2. 1 %, was caused by political stabilities, law enforcement uncertainties, and investment financing constraint caused by the slow recovery of banking.

40|$|When {{implemented}} {{within a}} favourable legislative framework, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can produce domestic growth-enhancing spillovers in host countries. Other potential positive effects include {{the provision of}} investment capital, the creation of local employment and the transfer of sophisticated technology or advanced knowledge. African nations in particular have been historically reliant on externally-provided funds. Prevailing low income levels, marginal savings rates {{and the absence of}} functioning financial markets necessary to provide local start-up capital continue to keep Africa reliant on foreign inflows. Considering China’s increasing financial commitments to Sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) over the last decade, this study examines the state of current Sino-African investment relationships. Specific attention is paid to the outcomes of this strategic bilateral alliance in order {{to determine whether or not}} a mutually beneficial investment relationship has evolved. The distinct nature and structure of, the motivation behind and the most significant determinants of Chinese FDI to SSA are all analysed in accordance with traditional FDI theories. A case study approach is used to establish whether China’s contemporary interest in SSA differs from historical investments and to also investigate country-specific commonalities and differences. Of particular relevance to SSA are resource-backed Chinese loans that finance major infrastructure projects in host nations. Interestingly, a lot of the Sino-African investment packages resemble similar deals struck between China and Japan in the 1970 s. The results of this study indicate that China’s investment motives seem more diverse than initially expected. Resource-seeking, profit-seeking and market access-seeking reasons appear to be the most important motives. After establishing the Top- Ten recipients of Chinese FDI in SSA, these nations are then classified into three major categories: resource-, oil- or agricultural-rich nations. Undiversified resource- or oil-rich economies are found to have secured the largest shares of Chinese FDI. This study suggests that China’s contemporary “African Safari” is an unconventional way of providing financial assistance. Rather than solely supplying FDI, China finances a diverse mix of instruments, the most important being concessional <b>loans,</b> <b>export</b> credits, zero-interest <b>loans</b> and the establishment of Special Economic Zones. A profound difference to traditional Western investment packages is China’s non-interference approach. Accordingly, Beijing not only refrains from intervening in host countries’ domestic affairs but also refuses to attach formal conditionalties to its loans. China’s “financial safari” into Africa has produced many positive as well as negative effects in host countries. Nevertheless, it would seem that the positive effects outweigh the negative and China’s FDI could contribute to sustainable development in SS...|$|R

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 35). Banking is the most lucrative business and thus should provide the best services to the clients to maintain its welfare. More importantly, since this sector is highly customer oriented, {{the only way it}} can achieve its goal is by satisfying the customers by providing quality, effective and efficient services. I got the privilege to work as an intern in Citibank, N. A., Dhaka (Motijheel branch) for sixteen (16) successive working weeks (4 month). The topics that I have focused in my report are on Citibank‟s work activity and services; that would be Corporate Banking and Trade which they practice all throughout Bangladesh. I worked under Trade Operations. In Trade, I basically worked under import, <b>export,</b> and <b>loan</b> and guarantee department. I have tried to gather as much information possible about how they work, which {{is in the form of}} “Corporate Banking in Bangladesh”, their “Trade” which they conduct with “Import and Export”, along with some loans and guarantees, and their managerial function. I have discussed about the bank‟s main focus points and also how they deal with their employees, clients and valuable customers. I also try to do a SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis and a data analysis for the last three consecutive years. Moreover, being able to work as part of Citibank‟s employee gave me a firsthand insight at how the bank approaches towards its employees, how these employees deal with their clients, and how the employees interact with each other. This real picture of the bank which I was able to observe through my eyes during my internship period has contributed greatly in preparing this report. I also gathered practical experience during this period which also helped me in preparing this report accurately. At last I must say that I was very lucky in getting this opportunity whereas people hardly get the chance to work as an intern at Citibank, N. A. Kazi Sarwar Jahan SunnyB.

40|$|Top down spillovers of {{sovereign}} default risk can have serious {{consequences for the}} private sector in emerging markets. This paper analyzes the effects of these spillovers using firm-level data from 31 emerging market economies. We assess how sovereign risk affects corporate access to international capital markets, in the form of external credit (loans and bond issuances) and equity issuances. The study first analyzes the impact {{of sovereign}} debt crises during the 1980 s and 1990 s. It goes on to examine the 1993 to 2007 period, using additional measures of sovereign risk-sovereign bond spreads and sovereign ratings-as explanatory variables. Overall, we find that sovereign default risk is a crucial determinant of private sector access to capital, be it external debt or equity. We also find that crisis resolution patterns matter and that defaults towards private creditors have stronger adverse consequences than defaults to official creditors.
