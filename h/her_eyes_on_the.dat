5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that}} of Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> palm of her hand. The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a {{far corner of the}} church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E

60|$|He was so solemn {{about it}} that {{everybody}} began to feel a bit upset, and Gerty borrowed Ted's pocket-'andkerchief, and then wiped <b>'er</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cuff of <b>her</b> dress instead.|$|R
60|$|His wife, who had {{followed}} them in, was already fastening <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> carpet.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was always}} unfort'nit," [...] sighed Matty, {{still holding the}} shovel and keeping <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grate, as if {{ready to make a}} furious attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{smallest}} spark that should venture to show itself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Humph!' said Miss Murdstone, still keeping <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pickles; 'it is of more {{importance}} than anything else--it is of paramount importance--that my brother {{should not be}} disturbed or made uncomfortable. I suppose I had better say yes.' ...|$|R
60|$|Grace fixed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. She {{could not}} look her mother in the face.|$|E

6000|$|The nurse stooped, with <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "You {{know that}} the postman went with this letter to Kingsdown Crescent?" [...] said Mrs. Milroy. [...] "And {{you know that he}} found Mrs. Mandeville gone away, nobody could tell where?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do stop, Nursey, or I shall {{go crazy}} because I don't know the secret!" [...] cried Effie, more than once; {{and she kept}} <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clock, for at seven in the evening the {{surprise}} was to come off.|$|R
6000|$|... "That young man," [...] said Uncle Donald, {{pursuing}} a train of thought, [...] "is {{going to be}} fat one of these days, if he doesn't look out. Travelling alone, was she? What did you do? Catch <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pier?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Grandma looked thoughtfully at {{the fire}} as she spoke, and Lotty said, with <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> portfolio: [...] "Perhaps Aunt Nell will do it for us. Then history won't be so dry, and we can glorify our fore-mothers as well as fathers." ...|$|R
60|$|Twinkle {{got up and}} followed, keeping <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pretty Prince, who leaped so {{fast that}} she had to trot to keep up with him. Nimble would wait on some clump of grass or bit of rock until the girl came up, and then away he'd go again.|$|R
