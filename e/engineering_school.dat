5|$|As president, Hall {{was noted}} for his {{aggressive}} fundraising and {{improvements to the}} school, including his special project, the Aaron S. French Textile School. In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first textile <b>engineering</b> <b>school</b> in the Southern United States, with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters. It named the A. French Textile School, after its chief donor and supporter, Aaron S. French.|$|E
5|$|At 16 Higginbotham {{enrolled}} in Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Indiana. He chose Purdue because it admitted black students; was cheaper, at that time, than Rutgers University; and offered tuition discounts for good academic performance. Higginbotham was {{also interested in}} Purdue {{because he wanted to}} be an engineer, and Purdue was known as an <b>engineering</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Tesla {{returned}} to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden {{for nine months}} and was near death multiple times.

5|$|A 1928 {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Wilson was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the field artillery but underwent flying training and, on receiving his pilot's wings, transferred to the United States Army Air Corps in 1929.

5|$|Due to {{its origins}} as an <b>engineering</b> <b>school,</b> the West Point {{curriculum}} emphasised mathematics and other technical subjects of relevance to that speciality rather than education in military topics. Much {{of the military}} training that was conducted concerned close order drill and equitation. Of the top 25 graduates {{of the class of}} 1915, 24 were commissioned into the Corps of Engineers. The exception, James A. Lester, who was ranked 23rd in the class, chose to go into the field artillery instead. He would also become major general.|$|E
5|$|McCauley's {{seniority}} {{and instructional}} experience {{kept him in}} Australia on training assignments for the first eighteen months of World WarII.

Promoted to group captain, he then took over No.1 Service Flying Training School at Point Cook until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Elwyn King. During McCauley's tenure, the number of aircraft operated by the school doubled from its initial complement of 52, and monthly flying hours increased from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology {{can be traced back}} to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an <b>engineering</b> <b>school</b> to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E

5|$|The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer were {{not seen as}} professionally {{equal to that of}} a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son.
