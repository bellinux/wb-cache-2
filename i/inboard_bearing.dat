5000|$|The cars {{used the}} revolutionary, and aptly named, Budd Pioneer III truck, {{which was a}} lightweight, <b>inboard</b> <b>bearing</b> {{railroad}} bogie designed for high-speed operation. This truck would see continued use by Budd on its subsequent Silverliner order, as well as MUs ordered by the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North, PATCO rapid transit cars and the Amtrak Amfleet cars, where they would operate up to speeds of [...] The Pioneer III cars used a slightly different right-angle gearbox (adapted from the very successful Budd-built PTC M-3 transit cars) set the traction motors at a right angle to the axle instead of the more common lateral placement. The need for a larger traction motor resulted in the change to the more traditional layout in the Silverliner II design.|$|E
50|$|This is in {{contrast}} to the wishbone. Wishbones are triangular and have two widely spaced <b>inboard</b> <b>bearings.</b> These constrain the outboard end of the wishbone from moving back and forth, controlling two degrees of freedom, and without requiring additional links.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the Class 220s, B5000 {{lightweight}} bogies are used - these are easily recognisable since the entire outer surface of the wheel is visible, with <b>inboard</b> axle <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Squirrel {{name was}} used for Scott {{motorcycles}} since 1921 but {{with the death of}} the founder Alfred Angas Scott in 1923 the unorthodox Scott two-stroke motorcycles began to become more conventional. Development of the three-speed Scott Flying Squirrel began in 1922 as the company was in severe debt and faced receivership. Launched at the 1926 Earls Court motorcycle show, the Flying Squirrel was expensive - nearly twice the cost of a sporting four-stroke motorcycle of the time. [...] The unique water-cooled circulation used a convection method known as the thermosyphon system. The bottom end block was painted either green or red for racing or road respectively and featured a centrally positioned flywheel, twin <b>inboard</b> main <b>bearings,</b> overhung crankpins and doors to enable ease of access to the engine. The redesigned three-speed gearbox, multi-plate clutch and the repositioned magneto were all significant improvements.|$|R
5000|$|The Pioneer III {{lightweight}} coach (Budd {{serial number}} 3880) {{was completed in}} 1956 and was seen by the Budd Company as a milestone product that could revolutionize the passenger railcar market. With this assessment in mind, the Pioneer III name was chosen {{in reference to the}} Budd Pioneer stainless steel aircraft and the Pioneer Zephyr lightweight trainset. The coach was designed for medium or short distance inter-city passenger travel with extreme emphasis placed on saving weight. This was accomplished through the use of electric train heat and air conditioning in place of steam and mechanical systems, high-speed <b>inboard</b> <b>bearing</b> trucks that used air suspension instead of heavier springs, an airline-style bathroom instead of the fully equipped [...] "lounge" [...] style and a thin [...] stainless steel carbody. The result was a car that weighed only 53000 lb, nearly half the amount of the then state-of-the-art [...] "lightweight" [...] stainless steel cars being manufactured by Budd. With a capacity of 88 passengers in a 2+2 seating configuration, the Pioneer III coach achieved a 600 lb weight-to-passenger ratio, a number not seen since the days when passenger cars had been made out of wood. Unfortunately, these remarkable statistics were accomplished at the expense of comfort, as passengers were provided with significantly reduced legroom compared to other coaches in the same class and a bouncier ride.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 89 The boiler {{feedwater}} {{system in}} a world scale ethylene plant utilized horizontal multistage barrel case pumps and single stage impulse type steam turbine drivers with mechanical governors. As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and <b>inboard</b> <b>bearing</b> bracket stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke governor valve stems. The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out. These problems became very high profile when the newly rerated boiler feedwater pumps tripped and caused a total plant shutdown resulting in a 14 hr flare. Not only was there a major financial impact from lost production, it also prompted the ministry of the Environment to initiate {{a review of the}} company?s entire flaring history. Although it took a difficult year of effort, the pumps and turbines are now operating satisfactorily. The problems discovered are discussed, along with the analysis performed and the solutions implemented...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 28 The two subject blowers {{operate in}} {{parallel}} to circulate wet chlorine gas. Both units had large synchronous vibrations {{that led to}} multiple bearing failures. After simple rotordynamic studies failed to identify the problem, a comprehensive model that accounted for both the motor and blower was successful at identifying the problem as high sensitivity to unbalance loads due to an extremely lightly-loaded (less than one pound) condition at the blower?s <b>inboard</b> <b>bearing</b> (refer to Gutzwiller and Corbo, 2011). Based {{on the results of}} the rotordynamic analysis, two changes were made to both units. The couplings were changed from disk to gear couplings, and the blower?s bearings were changed from plain cylindrical to tilting-pad designs. After implementing these changes, unit ?A? ran smoothly for a period of six weeks, in accordance with the predictions of the rotordynamic analysis, and it appeared to all that the problem was completely solved. However, when the ?B? blower was then started up the two machines then commenced a three month period of operation in which each suffered from intermittent periods of high synchronous vibrations. During this time, the following behavior traits, which {{can only be described as}} bizarre, were observed: 1. 	After a smooth startup, vibration increased to a high level after about one week. 2. 	The transition from low vibrations to high vibrations was almost instantaneous. Additionally, this transition was always accompanied by an axial motion of the blower rotor away from the active thrust bearing. 3. 	The units appeared to be more likely to suffer high vibrations when both were running simultaneously. 4. 	Starting one machine might result in increased vibrations on the other, and shutting down a machine might lower vibrations on the other. 5. 	Someone observed that during a rainstorm the vibration levels decreased. (Note: the blowers are located outside.) Spraying water on the bearings sometimes (but not always) had a similar effect. A task force of experts was then commissioned and an extensive troubleshooting effort commenced. Some of the potential root causes that were hypothesized included blower surging, starvation of the tilting-pad bearings, thermally-induced misalignment, insufficient blower thrust, acoustic resonance, axial vibration, seal rubbing, and Morton effects. After an extensive troubleshooting effort that included more rotordynamic analysis, bearing flow analysis, blower thrust analysis, and extensive studying of orbit plots, spectrum plots, and vibration and temperature histories, the task force concluded that the most likely cause was rubbing at the blower?s carbon ring seal. Accordingly, the seal was disassembled and its locating pins were found to have come loose and generated a rub. Design changes were then implemented to provide better retention for the pins. The units were then restarted and it was verified that the modifications had finally eliminated the vibration problems. This paper shows how the combination of rotordynamic analysis and troubleshooting skills was employed to identify and generate corrective actions for two independent causes of high synchronous vibrations...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 8 A new {{cogeneration}} installation was in {{the process}} of being commissioned when severe subsynchronous vibration was detected on the generator during no load tests. Subsequently, two rotordynamics problems were discovered. These problems prohibited the steam turbine generator set from reaching full speed. Additional vibration problems were anticipated once the generator was loaded and the steam flows through the turbines increased. The first subsynchronous vibration problem, observed during initial full speed, no-load run attempts, was found to be most severe at the <b>inboard</b> generator <b>bearing</b> and the adjacent turbine bearing. The second problem, uncovered during analysis of the generator vibration problem, was the presence of low-level subsynchronous vibration at a different frequency on both bearings of the high pressure-intermediate pressure (HP-IP) turbine rotor. The concern was that this vibration would be exacerbated once the machine was loaded and additional aerodynamic cross-coupling was introduced by steam flow at seal and wheel locations. This paper detailed the discovery of the problems, initial attempts to address them, and the use of rotordynamics tool to engineer a solution to the problems by the design, manufacture, and installation of optimized bearings...|$|R
40|$|A bearing/shaft {{model of}} the SSME LOX {{turbopump}} was developed using the SHABERTH bearing/shaft math modeling computer code. A previously developed bearing/shaft thermal {{model of the}} SSME LOX turbopump turbine and bearing was {{used in conjunction with}} SHABERTH to evaluate the thermomechanical operating characteristics of the LOX turbopump end bearings. Results show that for the two unmounted diametrical clearances evaluated (4. 0 mils and 6. 3 mils), the <b>inboard</b> pump end <b>bearing</b> supports about 81 % of the isolator load for the small clearance and 77 % of the isolator load for the larger clearance. Bearing clearance changes due to thermal effects were 40 % for the 4. 0 mil diametrical clearance case and 19 % for the 6. 3 mil clearance case evaluated. The thermal analysis included evaluation of bearing temperatures for a subcooled case and a saturated case. Results indicate that no drastic temperature change occurred between the two cases. Since the rolling element and race surfaces of the subcooled case were at temperatures sufficiently high enough to be vapor blanketed, exceeding saturation temperature at the bearing inlet did not increase surface temperatures greatly...|$|R
