5|$|For {{the second}} time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who {{declined}} to sign a trade agreement, on the ground that the Japanese Embassy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women {{were more likely to have}} their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from Kent and that, from {{their use of}} wording, it appeared {{that they had been}} told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E

5|$|By September1, {{the storm}} began to consolidate, with {{reconnaissance}} flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60mph (95km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective {{development in the}} western portion; however, outflow {{in other areas of}} the storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a mid-tropospheric ridge located over Florida, strengthened. Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify as the center of circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on the storm that Earl <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully tropical due to the lack of organization. Around 1200UTC on September2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{information}} from historical weather maps, {{it appeared that}} eastward-moving lower-atmospheric flow was present between September 16 and 17, though a closed circulation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present. On September 18, the system developed into tropical depression between the Bahamas and Florida while it moved west-northwestward. After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on September 19 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) early during September 20. It began turning north on September 21, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on September 22. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on September 23. As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partagás had doubt {{as to whether or}} not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded when the system was classified as extratropical.|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated {{at the time of the}} assault.|$|E

25|$|The rebels {{encountered}} little resistance at {{the start}} of the attack on Saigon, and this allowed them to generate momentum. This was primarily to Diệm and Nhu's complacency and mistaken assumption that the military action was the start of Operation Bravo. The central police called Diệm, informing him that the marines <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friendly. It was too late as the rebels captured the police headquarters and shut down the secret police, which were directly controlled by Nhu.|$|E
25|$|Other {{concerns}} {{included an}} NOE between U4 and U7 of the cleaved hammerhead ribozyme that {{had also been}} observed during NMR characterization, which suggested that these nucleotide bases must approach one another closer than about 6 Å, although close approach of U7 to U4 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possible from the crystal structure.

25|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that the incident <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked to organized international terrorist groups. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs reaffirmed what Homeland Security said, and that President Barack Obama was briefed on the incident. The President expressed his concern and commended the courageous actions of the first responders. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) launched two F-16 fighter aircraft from Ellington Airport in Houston, Texas, to conduct an air patrol in response to the crash. That action was reported as standard operating procedure in this situation.|$|E

25|$|On April 6, 2010, Arizona {{officials}} executed {{search warrants}} at governmental {{offices of the}} towns of Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah. According to one report, the warrants involved the misuse of funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department to be shut down. According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered out of the buildings while the search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow. Despite these protests, public safety <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected, as the county law enforcement agencies involved routed calls for emergency service through the county offices. A search warrant was also executed at Jake Barlow's residence.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s, {{businesses}} started leaving downtown Augusta for both Regency Mall and Augusta Mall. That started a trend of urban abandonment and decay. To counter this trend, city politicians and business leaders promoted revitalizing Augusta's hidden riverfront (obscured by a levee) into Riverwalk Augusta, with parks, an amphitheater, hotels, museums, and art galleries. The first segment of Riverwalk Augusta was opened {{in the late}} 1980s and later expanded in the early 1990s. However, the renaissance of the riverfront <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spilling over into Augusta's main street, Broad Street, as more businesses were leaving and more storefronts boarded up. Broad Street is the second widest Broad street in America.|$|E
25|$|When Pauling and Corey first {{proposed}} the alpha sheet, {{they suggested that}} it agreed well with fiber diffraction results from beta-keratin fibers. However, since the alpha sheet <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> energetically favorable, they argued that beta sheets would occur more commonly among normal proteins, and subsequent demonstration that beta-keratin is made of beta sheets consigned the alpha sheet proposal to obscurity. Recently the alpha strand conformation has been observed in isolated instances in native state proteins as solved by X-ray crystallography or protein NMR, although an extended alpha sheet was not identified in any known natural protein. Native proteins identified as containing alpha-strand regions or alpha-sheet-patterned hydrogen bonding include synaptotagmin, lysozyme, and potassium channels, where the alpha-strands line the ion-conducting pore.|$|E

25|$|The Washington Post {{found no}} {{evidence}} that Cuccinelli sought to personally intervene in the lawsuit. In April 2013, Cuccinelli recused himself from the case, hiring private attorneys to defend the state. Cuccinelli subsequently announced that he had discovered the equivalent of $4,500 in additional gifts from Jonnie R. Williams that he had not previously disclosed, including free use of Williams' Smith Mountain Lake vacation lodge in 2010 and 2012. In response, Cuccinelli asked the Commonwealth’s attorney to review his disclosure filings. On July 18, 2013, a state prosecutor announced that he had {{found no evidence}} that Cuccinelli had violated the law, saying Cuccinelli <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attempting to conceal the relationship with Williams and he did not intentionally mischaracterize any gifts.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, general {{relativity}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory. It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, {{as most of}} its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its mathematics of {{general relativity}} seemed difficult and fully understandable only by {{a small number of}} people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical phenomena were discovered, such as quasars (1963), the 3-kelvin microwave background radiation (1965), pulsars (1967), and the first black hole candidates (1981), the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further confirmed the theory.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{approval}} of honor is dependent upon the recognition of others, during ancient times individuals worked hard for {{the approval}} of their peers within their societal cultures. This meant that individuals {{were more likely to}} behave like their honorable counterparts. Groups reinforced {{what it meant to be}} honorable through various expected behaviors and goals placed amongst individual members. This discouraged members from any negative activity that may have adversely affected a group or family's honor. In the event that the leader of the group promoted actions that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honorable on a larger societal scale, the leader then offered some explanation defending their actions which lead to the preservation of what they defined as honor and their traditions forever.|$|E
