500|$|As both Hijo del Espantos {{are working}} as enmascarados, or masked {{professional}} wrestlers, their birthnames are not publized as is tradition in lucha libre when a wrestler {{has never been}} unmasked in the ring. Due to the secrecy {{it is not clear}} if Hijo del Espanto I wrestled under a different name before making his debut as El Hijo del Espanto in 1993. Hijo del Espanto <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trained</b> by Fernando Cisneros Carrillo, better known as Espanto II, and Cisneros allowed Hijo del Espanto I to use the name. In 1999 Espantito, a diminutive version of Los Espantos, commented that he had trained with El Hijo del Espanto I under CIsneros, remembering him as a dedicated wrestler with a [...] "great mind" [...] for the sport.|$|E

2500|$|Clare Tyler (later Bates) was {{introduced}} by {{the executive producer of}} EastEnders, Leonard Lewis. Gemma Bissix was cast in the role. Reflecting on the casting process in 2001, Bissix said, [...] "I was nine when I started on EastEnders. I did drama classes after school and my mum took me to an audition. There were about 50 others. I read through the script and by the time I was home they had phoned my dad to tell him I had the role. I was only supposed to be in it for three episodes, but it turned into five years." [...] It was her first acting job and she had received no formal training. In 2008, Bissix stated, [...] "that was my training [...] quite a lot of people [...] drama school, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trained</b> by EastEnders." [...] The character made her first appearance in July 1993 as the daughter of Debbie Tyler (played by Nicola Duffett), a love interest for an EastEnders regular, Nigel Bates (played by Paul Bradley).|$|E

6000|$|I {{had been}} at Bristol in the summer looking for work, and then I had a notion that I might get {{something}} at Portsmouth, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trained</b> as a skilled mechanic, so I came tramping my way across the south of England, and doing odd jobs as I went. I was trying all I knew to keep off the cross, for I had done a year in Exeter Gaol, and I {{had had enough of}} visiting Queen Victoria. But it's cruel hard to get work when once the black mark is against your name, and it was all I could do to keep soul and body together. At last, after ten days of wood-cutting and stone-breaking on starvation pay, I found myself near Salisbury with a couple of shillings in my pocket, and my boots and my patience clean wore out. There's an alehouse called [...] "The Willing Mind," [...] which stands on the road between Blandford and Salisbury, and it was there that night I engaged a bed. I was sitting alone in the taproom just about closing time, when the inn-keeper--Allen his name was--came beside me and began yarning about the neighbours. He was a man that liked to talk and to have some one to listen to his talk, so I sat there smoking and drinking a mug of ale which he had stood me; and I took no great interest in what he said until he began to talk (as the devil would have it) about the riches of Mannering Hall.|$|E
60|$|My name is Boffer Bings. I {{was born}} of honest parents {{in one of the}} humbler walks of life, my father being a {{manufacturer}} of dog-oil and my mother having a small studio {{in the shadow of the}} village church, where she disposed of unwelcome babes. In my boyhood <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trained</b> to habits of industry; I not only assisted my father in procuring dogs for his vats, but was frequently employed by my mother to carry away the debris of her work in the studio. In performance of this duty I sometimes had need of all my natural intelligence for all the law officers of the vicinity were opposed to my mother's business. They were not elected on an opposition ticket, and the matter had never been made a political issue; it just happened so. My father's business of making dog-oil was, naturally, less unpopular, though the owners of missing dogs sometimes regarded him with suspicion, which was reflected, to some extent, upon me. My father had, as silent partners, all the physicians of the town, who seldom wrote a prescription which did not contain what they were pleased to designate as Ol. can. It is really the most valuable medicine ever discovered. But most persons are unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the afflicted, and it was evident that many of the fattest dogs in town had been forbidden to play with me--a fact which pained my young sensibilities, and at one time came near driving me to become a pirate.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{distinct}} and complete impression, something that I don't {{know whether to}} call a Landfall or a Departure. Certainly he had gazed at times very fixedly before him with the Landfall's vigilant look, this sea-captain seated incongruously in a deep-backed chair. He had not then talked to me of employment, of ships, of being ready to take another command; but he had discoursed of his early days, in the abundant but thin flow of a wilful invalid's talk. The women looked worried, but sat still, and I learned more of him in that interview than in the whole eighteen months we had sailed together. It appeared he had [...] "served his time" [...] in the copper-ore trade, the famous copper-ore trade of old days between Swansea and the Chilian coast, coal out and ore in, deep-loaded both ways, as if in wanton defiance of the great Cape Horn seas--a work, this, for staunch ships, and a great school of staunchness for West- Country seamen. A whole fleet of copper-bottomed barques, as strong in rib and planking, as well-found in gear, as ever was sent upon the seas, manned by hardy crews and commanded by young masters, was engaged in that now long defunct trade. [...] "That was the school <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trained</b> in," [...] {{he said to me}} almost boastfully, lying back amongst his pillows with a rug over his legs. And it was in that trade that he obtained his first command at a very early age. It was then that he mentioned to me how, as a young commander, he was always ill for a few days before making land after a long passage. But this sort of sickness used to pass off with the first sight of a familiar landmark. Afterwards, he added, as he grew older, all that nervousness wore off completely; and I observed his weary eyes gaze steadily ahead, as if there had been nothing between him and the straight line of sea and sky, where whatever a seaman is looking for is first bound to appear. But I have also seen his eyes rest fondly upon the faces in the room, upon the pictures on the wall, upon all the familiar objects of that home, whose abiding and clear image must have flashed often on his memory in times of stress and anxiety at sea. Was he looking out for a strange Landfall, or taking with an untroubled mind the bearings for his last Departure? ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his {{decision}} to retire years later, Richardson remarked [...] "I resigned and retired because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> burnt out {{and it was a}} struggle to continue playing cricket.

These nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit--for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid of the Church.|$|R
