40|$|Key facts: - Solar {{water heating}} systems use the sun's energy to provide hot water, space heating, and air conditioning. - More than 1. 5 million homes and {{businesses}} currently use solar water heating in the United States, representing a capacity of over 1, 000 megawatts (MW) of thermal energy generation. Another 400 MW {{is likely to be}} installed over the next 3 - 5 years, according to the US Department of Energy. - Assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the United States have sufficient access to sunlight, 29 million solar water-heating systems could be installed. Solar <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> can operate in any climate. Performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site, as well as how cold the water coming into the system is.

40|$|To assess {{risk factors}} {{associated}} with the contamination of the domestic environment by legionellae, 211 houses in the Quebec City area were randomly selected and water samples were collected from the hot water tank, the shower heads, and {{the most frequently used}} faucet.

Data on the characteristics of the hot water system and plumbing in the house and on the personal habits of the occupants were collected for each house. Among these 211 houses, hot water was provided by either an oil or gas heater in 33 and by an electric heater in 178. Legionellae were isolated from none of the samples from houses with oil or gas heaters and from 39 % (69 of 178) of those <b>with</b> electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> (P less than 0. 0001).

We conducted a 2 -year, prospective, environmental study to evaluate whether converting from chlorine to monochloramine for water disinfection would decrease Legionella colonization of hot water systems. Water and biofilm samples from 53 buildings were collected for Legionella culture during 6 intervals. Prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing Legionella colonization before and after monochloramine disinfection were adjusted for water system characteristics. Legionella colonized 60 % of the hot water systems before monochloramine versus 4 % after conversion (PR 0. 07, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03 - 0. 16).

40|$|The {{residential}} {{oil burner}} market is currently {{dominated by the}} pressure-atomized, retention head burner. At low firing rates pressure atomizing nozzles suffer rapid fouling of the small internal passages, leading to bad spray patterns and poor combustion performance. To overcome the low input limitations of conventional burners, a low pressure air-atomized burner has been developed watch can operate at fining rates as low as 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour (10 kW). In addition, the burner can be operated in a high/low fining rate mode. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at a fixed input rate of 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination. At the test home, instrumentation was installed to measure fuel and energy flows and record trends in system temperatures. Laboratory efficiency testing <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and boilers has been completed using standard single purpose and combined appliance test procedures.

This paper examines the role of hot water system rebate programs in shifting the existing stock of electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> toward more climate friendly versions using two unique data sets from New South Wales homeowners. The first data set is based on a survey of households who recently purchased a <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and exploits a natural experiment created by the rebate program to quantify its effects. The other data set is based on a set of stated preference questions asked of households who own an older <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and will in the reasonably near future face a replacement decision. We find that recent rebate programs significantly increased the share of solar/heat pump systems. For households without access to natural gas, this increased share comes directly from inefficient electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> For households <b>with</b> access to natural gas, older existing electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> would likely have been replaced <b>with</b> gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> {{in the absence of the}} rebate programs. The rebate program appears to be much less effective when <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> are replaced on an emergency basis. Data from discrete choice experiments was analysed using several flexible choice models. A newly proposed model that combines a latent class approach with a random coefficients approach clearly dominates the other models in terms of statistical fit.
