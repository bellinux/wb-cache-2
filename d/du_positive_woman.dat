40|$|Background: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection primarily affects women during their reproductive years, and the coexistence of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) {{is not surprising}} {{given the fact that}} HIV is mainly acquired via heterosexual contact. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the occurrence of RTIs among infected and noninfected women. Materials and Methods: A case control study of 83 HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> tested by two enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a matched control of 87 HIV negative women were screened for RTIs. They were submitted to gynecological examination and cervical cytology. Results: The mean age for HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> was 30 years and that for HIV negative women was 27 years. 18 &#x 0025; HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> had menstrual irregularities compared to 6 &#x 0025; in seronegative group (P = 0. 024). Vaginal infections including sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were found in 47 (57 &#x 0025;) HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and 30 (34 &#x 0025;) HIV negative women (P = 0. 0037). Vaginal candidiasis was the most common infection (34 &#x 0025;) in HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> followed by trichomoniasis (12 &#x 0025;). Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was seen in nine HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> versus none in HIV negative women. Cervical cytology showed inflammation in 53 (64 &#x 0025;) HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> compared to 27 (31 &#x 0025;) HIV negative women (P = 0. 000023). Genital neoplasia, including carcinoma in situ was observed in 2 (2. 5 &#x 0025;) HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and in none of the HIV negative women. Conclusion: It is seen that reproductive tract morbidities are common in HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> So it is imperative that HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> have a complete gynecological evaluation including a Papanicolaou (PAP) smear with aggressive screening of STIs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Rates of {{vertical}} HIV transmission {{between mother and}} child are low, allowing many HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> to have children with near impunity. In this study, data from the Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort Study were used to describe maternal characteristics and their association with pregnancy outcomes in HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> Study design: HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> were followed prospectively during their pregnancies and deliveries by anonymous questionnaires between January 2003 and October 2008. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included preterm delivery, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus. Results: This study included 266 HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> of which 67 (25. 2 %) were first diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy. Thirty percent (n= 80) of the women had pregnancy complications after 24 weeks of gestation. Preterm delivery was noted in 72 (27 %) patients. Other complications included preeclampsia (n= 7; 2. 6 %) and gestational diabetes (n= 7; 2. 6 %). Older maternal age was the only risk factor associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (adjusted odds ratio: 1. 06, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 - 1. 12, P= 0. 02). Conclusions: HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> especially with advanced maternal age, have high-risk pregnancies and should be monitored as in an interdisciplinary setting.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: High-risk human {{papillomavirus}} (hrHPV) testing {{is expected to}} replace cytology as primary screening method for cervical cancer screening in {{an increasing number of}} countries. The high sensitivity of hrHPV testing is combined with a limited specificity which makes triaging of hrHPV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> necessary. As an ideal triage method does not yet exist, an optimal triage strategy for hrHPV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> based on current knowledge should be obtained. The aim {{of this article is to}} present an overview of available options for triage of hrHPV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> with their strengths and limitations and possible future opportunities. AREAS COVERED: Current knowledge on morphological biomarkers, molecular biomarkers and combined triage strategies will be discussed to give an overview of the state-of-the-art on triaging hrHPV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> The literature search was limited to studies on triage strategies for hrHPV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> Expert commentary: Experience with morphology-based biomarkers makes these a valuable triage method. However, they lack the ability of differentiating productive from transforming infections. Molecular biomarkers are objective, highly reproducible, can be used in high throughput testing, and show promising results. With more extensive knowledge on these molecular markers, cervical cancer screening may transform to a full molecular screening in the future...|$|R
40|$|Poor, {{black women}} in their young {{adulthood}} are the greatest victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that ravages South Africa. This thesis is about the victimhood of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and a process from which a group of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> started renegotiating the victimhood that constrained their agency and power. HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> are perceived as inferior members of society due to unequal gender configurations, structures of power and traditional and religious beliefs, all of which favour a male bias. These aspects add on to the victimhood of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and constitute them to the private sphere where they suffer inaudibly and invisibly, separated from the cultural consciousness, and devoid of empathy and opportunities to influence the public discourse. In April 2008 a HIV University pilot project was implemented {{among a group of}} HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> living in Mpophomeni township, South Africa. This model created a space for the women participants to equip themselves with knowledge and experience that they could make use of to challenge social structures that discriminate against their HIV positiveness. The women thus adjusted the space of the HIV University intervention into a platform from which they could embark on challenging gender configurations, social structures, religious and cultural norms, all which appoints HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> to the role as suffering victims. The women recognized that {{in order for them to}} resist the submission they would need to become an organized group of visible, social agents with a public voice. The group thus started to pursue their aspiration to break out of the private and closed space created by the HIV University project and move from invisibility to visibility, silence to voice, and submission to resistance. The HIV University project was thus a means for the women participants to equip themselves with tools they could utilize to resist their subjugation as HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and to reveal themselves from their culturally constituted victimhood...|$|R

40|$|Background. Postpartum {{thyroiditis}} (PPT) is {{a common}} triphasic autoimmune disease in women with thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies. This study evaluated women's thyroid disease symptoms, physical findings, stress levels, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels across six postpartum months in three groups, TPO negative, TPO positive, and PPT <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> Methods. Women were recruited in midpregnancy (n= 631) and TPO status was determined which then was used to form the three postpartum groups. The three groups were compared on TSH levels, thyroid symptoms, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, a thyroid exam, and stress scores. Results. Fifty-six percent of the TPO <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> developed PPT. Hypothyroid group (F (2, 742) = 5. 8, P=. 003) and hyperthyroid group (F (2, 747) = 6. 6, P=. 001) subscale scores differed by group. Several symptoms and stress scores were highest in the PPT group. Conclusions. The normal postpartum is associated with many symptoms that mimic thyroid disease symptoms, but severity is greater in women with either TPO or PPT positivity. While the most severe symptoms were generally seen in PPT <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> even TPO <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> seem to have higher risk for these signs and symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) {{has been}} {{identified}} as the greatest means of HIV infection among children. Adherence to antiretroviral drugs is necessary to prevent drug resistance and MTCT of HIV among HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> However, there is a gap in clients’ knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) which influence their decision to adhere to ART. Methods The study was a descriptive cross-sectional employing both qualitative and quantitative methods. The study involved 229 HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> in reproductive age (18 – 49 [*]years) and had been on ART for at least six months. Fourteen health workers were also included in the qualitative study. Respondents were selected from three ART centers in the Kumasi Metropolis through systematic random sampling from August to November 2011. HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> who had consistently missed two or more ART appointments within the previous two months were classified as defaulters. Data was analyzed with SPSS 19 and STATA 11. Logistic regression was run to assess the odds ratios at 95 % confidence level. Results The ART defaulter rate was 27 % and clients had good knowledge about ART and PMTCT. More than 90 % of the HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> had inadequate knowledge about ART and PMTCT and these women were more likely to default ART (OR[*]=[*] 3. 5; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 89, 6. 21). The educational background of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> did not have significant influence on their knowledge of ART and PMTCT. Conclusions Mothers, knowledge and understanding of ART and PMTCT could influence their adherence to ART. Educational interventions which target the understanding of both the literate and illiterate women in society are necessary to develop positive behaviors and enhance adherence to ART. </p...|$|R

Aim {{of the study}} was to study the prevalence of STI in 50 females with HIV infection and 50 females without HIV infection and to study the pap smear of patients to look for any cellular changes (dysplasia) due to sexually transmitted infections. Material and methods: The present study was an observational study, which was undertaken on 100 females with STIs (50 females with coexistent HIV infection and 50 females without HIV infection), in the age group 15 - 49 years attending Skin and VD OPD of Rajindra hospital, Patiala. Results: In our study, the commonest presenting complaint in case of both HIV positive (66 %) and HIV negative (80 %) women was vaginal discharge. PAP smear abnormalities were present in 28 (56 %) HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> and 11 (22 %) HIV negative women. In case of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women,</b> the inflammation was trichomonal in 4 (8 %), bacterial in 2 (4 %), fungal in 2 (4 %) and non-specific in 20 (40 %) patients. In HIV negative women, the inflammation was trichomonal in 2 (4 %) patients, bacterial in 2 (4 %) patients and non-specific in 7 (14 %) patients. The difference in abnormality seen in PAP smear between HIV positive and HIV negative women is statistically significant only in case of non-specific inflammation which is more common in case of HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusion: From the present study, it was concluded vaginal discharge was the commonest presenting complaint in both HIV positive and HIV negative women, though the commonest cause of vaginal discharge was candidiasis in HIV positive females and bacterial vaginosis in HIV negative females. Also, PAP smear abnormalities were significantly higher in HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> than HIV negative women.

40|$|Background: HIV {{infection}} {{is associated with}} a higher incidence of precancerous cervical lesions and their progression to invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Zambia is a global epicenter of HIV and ICC, yet the overall burden of cervical pre-cancer [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) ] and ICC among its HIV positive adult female population is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the burden of cervical disease among HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> in Zambia by estimating the number with CIN 3 and ICC. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 309 HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> attending screening in Lusaka (Zambia’s most populated province) to measure the cervical disease burden by visual inspection with acetic acid enhanced by digital cervicography (DC), cytology, and histology. We then used estimates of the prevalence of CIN 3 and ICC from the cross-sectional study and Spectrum model-based estimates for HIV infection among Zambian women to estimate the burden of CIN 3 and ICC among HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> nationally. Results: Over half (52 %) of the study participants screened positive by DC, while 45 % had cytologic evidence of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) or worse. Histopathologic evaluation revealed that 20 % of women had evidence of CIN 2 or worse, 11 % had CIN 3 or worse, and 2 % had ICC. Using the Spectrum model, we therefore estimate that 34, 051 HIV <b>positive</b> <b>women</b> in Zambia have CIN 3 and 7, 297 have ICC. Conclusions: The DC, cytology, and histology results revealed a large cervical disease burden in this previously unscreened HIV positive population. This very large burden indicates that continued scale-up of cervical cancer screening and treatment is urgently needed...|$|R
