5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E

25|$|One {{sad story}} redolent of its era {{is that of}} a 'professional class' couple from England, Mr. & Mrs. Barker, who {{committed}} suicide in Victorian times (1844) by tying themselves together and jumping from Laigh Milton Viaduct into the Irvine, which has a depth of only around three feet at this point. They were buried in the Kilmaurs churchyard in an unmarked grave. They are known to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few weeks in lodgings and apparently enjoyed the 'sights and sounds' of Ayrshire.

25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by CO2 capture and storage.|$|E
25|$|K 183: Had been {{in service}} with Steamrail Victoria until 13 October 2002, when this {{locomotive}} {{was involved in}} a serious level crossing accident with a B-double semi-trailer near Benalla, Victoria, derailing after impact. Tragically, three people on the footplate died in the collision. The locomotive was extensively damaged and is currently stored out of service. As of 2013, the locomotive is still receiving insurance money from the accident in which will go towards the future restoration of the steam train to its former glory. Before then, the engine had been plinthed at Yarragon following withdrawal from the Victorian Railways; Yarragon council had selected that engine specifically, believing it to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> majority of its life in the region though it is not clear if this is actually correct. In 1982 the engine unit was swapped for K 162, though the tender units remained at Yarragon and Newport respectively. Around 1984, K 183 re-entered service under Steamrail, with the tender formerly attached to K 162, and in a dark blue with gold lining livery. Owned by Victrack.|$|E
