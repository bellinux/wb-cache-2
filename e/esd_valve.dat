40|$|Partial stroke testing (PST) is a {{technique}} that is regularly practiced in oil and gas industries to test the emergency shutdown (<b>ESD)</b> <b>valve</b> by closing {{a certain percentage of}} the valve position and stop any flow through the pipeline. Generally, it only functions when there is an emergency occurring in the production system. When the <b>ESD</b> <b>valve</b> remains in one position for a long period, there is a risk and potential of fail on demand which is, the <b>ESD</b> <b>valve</b> fail to operate during the emergency shutdown. This testing can reveal approximately 75 of unrevealed failures in valves. It can also provide predictive maintenance data that can contribute to the extension of the preventive maintenance for the <b>ESD</b> <b>valve.</b> The objectives of this paper are to design, simulate, build and test the performance of the automated PST system based on PLC. Four guidelines and methodology are used in this work. First, understanding the operation of the PST system. Then, the utilization of the capability of MATLAB-Simulink software as the simulation tool for the PST design system. Next, designing the PST automated system based on PLC design and lastly, testing the performance of the PST design system using lab scale PST system prototype that has been built. Results of the project shows that the PST system is successfully designed and simulated via MATLAB-Simulink and the PLC programming is working in the correct order as performed on the prototype...|$|E
40|$|LNG is the {{preferred}} solution to meet environmental requirement and a great market growth is expected within few years. Lack of suitable infrastructure, regulation and bunkering practices poses challenges to the industry, however these barriers are currently being broken. Connect-LNG is in a conceptual phase of developing an innovative solution for LNG distribution and bunkering at inshore locations. A study of industry legislatives, normal industry practice, LNG properties and historical accident statistics, provided the basis needed to perform a HAZID of the concept. LNG is considered a hazardous cargo. The main hazards are identified as:?	Cryogenic temperatures (injury to people and to non cryogenic materials) ?	Fire, explosion or asphyxiation from potential LNG spillage?	Overpressure (thermal expansion and shock waves from potential Raphid Phase Transition (RPT) The main regulation related to the concept is ISO Interim TS 18683 - Guidelines for systems and installations for supply of LNG as fuel to ships, {{which is expected to}} enter into force during 2013. Additionally, NS-EN ISO 28460 Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas ? Ship to shore interface and port operations and NS-EN 1473 European Norm for Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas- Design of onshore Installation have shown high degree of relevance. Also, legislatives related to Ship-to-ship transfer are considered highly relevant. Safety requirements are generally imposed by the established regulates yielding large-scale LNG handling. However, the brutality of the consequences is often proportional to the quantity LNG handled, inherent safety. Thus for medium-to-small scale LNG facilities, the consequences of an unwanted event is assumed to be smaller. The following national regulative acts are important for the validation and responsibility decision between the relevant authorities: DSB topical guidelines, Major Accident regulations, The regulation of Fairways, The Port and Harbor Act. The authorities area of responsibility can be summarized in the following table:Authority	Responsibility DNV	LNG - carrier design approvalThe Norwegian Maritime Directorate	LNG - carrier operation and crew safety DSB	- Decisive power, approval of onshore facility and formal decision unit in the future. Inquire municipal authorities and public perceptionKystverket	 - Adequate safety in LNG carrier approaching area, ISPS Certification and piloting serviceMunicipal authorities - Decisive powerLocal port authorities - Decisive power, commonly landholderOperator (Skagerak Naturgass) - Responsible for safe operation, sufficient maintenance of facility according to given regulationThe conceivable safety distance for operation of the reel LNG can be summarized in the following table. Safety zone	DistanceOnshore, around LNG storage tank:	 25 metersAt sea, around the loading LNGC and buoy configuration: 50 metersAt sea, around the filling line: 12, 5 metersThe main, required inbound systems are listed below:-	<b>ESD</b> <b>valve</b> on buoy (Hydraulically self-contained) -	Breakoff coupling in the light loading hose-	QC/QD coupling towards the shipside -	Butterfly valves for normal operational control (open/close) -	Hose rupture safeguarding (to be located onshore) -	Riser annulus monitoring: Optical fibersThe results from the HAZID and from general industry feedback recommend a self-reliant system. This implies a further inherent operational execution and the requirements related to a minimum of manning at the onshore facility are maintained. </p...|$|E

40|$|Paravalvular {{regurgitation}} (PVR) following transcatheter {{aortic valve}} implantation (TAVI) {{is associated with}} poor survival. The two main valve delivery systems used to date differ significantly in both structure and deployment technique. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies identifying PVR in patients post-TAVI using Medtronic CoreValve (MCV) and Edward Sapien (<b>ES)</b> <b>valves</b> in order to identify whether a significant difference exists between valve types. The secondary objective was to identify additional factors predisposing to PVR to provide an overview of the other associated considerations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) {{is a novel}} technique for treatment of aortic stenosis in patients with high perioperative risk. It was previously shown that the self-expanding CoreValve, frequently presents dissymmetry, anatomical undersizing and incomplete apposition of struts. The aim of the present work was to evaluate symmetry {{and size of the}} balloon expanded Edwards Sapien <b>valve</b> (<b>ES)</b> by MSCT, aiming to evaluate whether central or paravalvular regurgitation may result from dissymmetric valve expansion. Methods: 24 patients underwent perioperative TEE and MSCT 1. 7 (0. 9 to 11. 6) months after TAVI. Cross-sectional areas and smallest and largest diameters (D 1, D 2) were measured by MSCT at 3 determined levels: i. e. at the ventricular and aortic ends {{and in the middle of}} the stent. Stent area and diameters measured on implanted valves were indexed to the size of fully expanded stents measured by MSCT on unimplanted valves in vitro. Areas and dimensions of valves with significant (grade > 1) vs. no or trivial paravalvular regurgitation were compared. Results: 11 patients had a 23 mm and 13 had a 26 mm ES prosthesis implanted. After TAVI, 16 patients had either no (n= 10) or trivial (n= 6) paravalvular regurgitation (group 1), while 8 patients had mild (n= 3) to moderate (n= 5) paravalvular regurgitation (group 2). By MSCT, the average minimal and maximal stent diameters were respectively 20. 0 ± 0. 8 and 21. 4 ± 0. 8 mm for 23 mm ES and 22. 8 ± 1. 0 and 23. 9 ± 1. 1 mm for 26 mm valves. Average maximal to minimal stent diameter ratio was 1. 04 ± 0. 04 for all valves. Only one patient had maximal to minimal valve diameter ratio > 1. 1 indicative of dissymmetry. Both for the 23 mm and 26 mm <b>ES</b> <b>valves,</b> stent areas were significantly larger at aortic (379. 28 ± 20. 3 and 468. 2 ± 20. 3 mm 2 respectively) than at middle (351. 7 ± 14. 9 and 438. 7 ± 26. 4 mm 2 respectively) or ventricular levels (338. 6 ± 18. 5 and 415. 6 ± 31. 0 mm 2 respectively), p< 0. 001 by repeated measurements ANOVA. Measured area at aortic level in vivo was 95 ± 18 % of area measured in fully expanded unimplanted stents in vitro. There was no significant difference of stent area, minimal or maximal diameter or ratio of maximal to minimal diameter at any levels, among patients with trivial or less (group 1) or significant (group 2) aortic regurgitation. Conclusions: In our present series, the <b>ES</b> <b>valve</b> was found to expand homogeneously to 95 % of predicted area with less than 4 % dissymmetry. Paravalvular regurgitation was not related to dissymmetry nor incomplete expansion of stents...|$|R
40|$|PurposeConduction {{disorders}} are frequent after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the incidence, the clinical impact and the predictive factors of new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVI. MethodsBetween 2010 and 2014, 198 consecutive patients underwent TAVI in our center and 156 were prospectively followed during 1 year (62 CoreValve (CV), 94 Edwards Sapiens <b>valve</b> (<b>ES)).</b> 42 patients were excluded because of a pre-existing PM before TAVI, death or surgery after TAVI. ResultsAfter 156 TAVI, 40 patients (26 %) required pacemaker implantation. CV patients were more frequently implanted than ES (35 % vs 19 %; p= 0. 03). Out of 116 non-implanted patients, 53 (46 %) patients presented with LBBB which persisted in 35 (30 %) patients. QRS width increased + 27 ms in post-procedure, + 21 ms at hospital discharge, + 15 ms at 1 month, + 11 ms at 1 year in the whole cohort. There was no clinical nor echocardiographic difference between the LBBB group and no-LBBB group. Ischemic neurological complication were more frequent during hospitalization in the LBBB group (8. 6 % vs 3. 7 %; p= 0. 007). On multivariate analysis, a pre-existing incomplete LBBB (OR 4. 15; IC 1. 31 - 13. 11; p= 0. 015) and a long pre-procedure PR interval (OR 1. 023; IC 1. 001 - 1. 046; p= 0. 038) were predictive factors of new persistent LBBB after TAVI and a trend with CV implantation was observed (OR 2. 35; IC 0. 99 - 5. 53; p= 0. 051). NYHA grade was increased in the LBBB group compared to non-LBBB group at 1 (2, 1 ± 0, 8 vs 1, 7 ± 0, 6; p= 0. 006), 6 (2, 21 ± 0, 7 vs 1, 53 ± 0, 6; p= 0. 001) and 12 months (2. 2 vs 1. 7, p= 0. 04). On univariate analysis, a pre-existing atrial fibrillation (OR 2. 1; IC 1. 12 - 4. 01; p= 0. 021), an initial mean aortic gradient (OR 0. 78; IC 0. 65 - 0. 93; p= 0. 006) and new LBBB after TAVI (OR 2. 06; IC 1. 05 - 4. 04; p= 0. 036) were predictive factors of mortality at 12 months. On multivariate analysis, LBBB after TAVI was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 3. 52; IC 1. 17 - 10. 58, p= 0. 025). ConclusionNew-onset LBBB is frequent after TAVI and persists in a great proportion of patients. In our study, LBBB after TAVI was an independent predictor of mortality...|$|R
