5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside the <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> a rotor blade {{is struck by}} a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the <b>emergency</b> <b>department</b> causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E

Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{severity}} of illness and outcomes among children admitted to a children's hospital PICU from referring <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> with and without access to a pediatric critical care telemedicine program. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary academic children's hospital PICU. Patients: Pediatric patients admitted directly to the PICU from referring <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> between 2010 and 2014. Interventions: None. Measurements: Demographic factors, severity of illness, and clinical outcomes among children receiving care in <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> with and without access to pediatric telemedicine, {{as well as a}} subcohort of children admitted from <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> before and after the implementation of telemedicine. Main Results: Five hundred eighty-two patients from 15 <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> with telemedicine and 524 patients from 60 <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> without telemedicine were transferred and admitted to the PICU. Children admitted from <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> using telemedicine were younger (5. 6 vs 6. 9 yr; p < 0. 001) and less sick (Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, 3. 2 vs 4. 0; p < 0. 05) at admission to the PICU compared with children admitted from <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> without telemedicine. Among transfers from <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> that established telemedicine programs during the study period, children arrived significantly less sick (mean Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores, 1. 2 units lower; p = 0. 03) after the implementation of telemedicine (n = 43) than before the implementation of telemedicine (n = 95). The observed-to-expected mortality ratios of posttelemedicine, pretelemedicine, and no-telemedicine cohorts were 0. 81 (95 % CI, 0. 53 - 1. 09), 1. 07 (95 % CI, 0. 53 - 1. 60), and 1. 02 (95 % CI, 0. 71 - 1. 33), respectively. Conclusions: The implementation of a telemedicine program designed to assist in the care of seriously ill children receiving care in referring <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> was associated with lower illness severity at admission to the PICU. This study contributes to the body of eviden ce that pediatric critical care telemedicine programs assist referring <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in the care of critically ill children and could result in improved clinical outcomes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the distribution and}} scope of nurse practitioner schemes in accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in England and Wales; to describe the caseloads of doctors and nurse practitioners on two representative days; and to estimate {{the number of patients}} managed by nurse practitioners in the year to 31 March 1991. DESIGN [...] A postal survey of accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> and a content analysis of case notes of new patients attending a representative sample of accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> on two days. SETTING [...] All accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS [...] Survey: 560 nurses in charge of accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> Census: case notes of 5814 patients in 37 accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Survey: number of accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> with nurse practitioner schemes. Census: demographic and clinical characteristics of new patients attending and whether nurse practitioner or doctor made diagnoses and ordered investigations, treatments, referrals, discharges. RESULTS [...] 513 replies (92 %) from 465 surveyed functioning accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>departments</b> and 48 departments recently closed. 27 (6 %) departments used designated nurse practitioners and 159 (34 %) "unofficial" nurse practitioners. Only 530 (9 %) of the 5814 patients in the census were managed entirely or mainly by nurse practitioners, with higher proportions in ophthalmic departments (nearly 30 %) and minor casualty departments (over 40 %) than in major departments (3 %). Most patients managed by nurse practitioners (86 %) had minor trauma. In the year ending 31 March 1991 an estimated 390, 000 (95 % confidence interval 260, 000 to 520, 000) patients {{out of a total of}} 12. 5 million (3. 1 %, 2. 1 % to 4. 1 %) were clinically managed by a nurse practitioner.

In 31 (73 %) <b>departments</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine physicians, in 4 (10 %) departments anesthetists, and in 7 (17 %) departments physicians of either specialty were routinely performing RSI.

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in the <b>emergency</b> <b>department,</b> with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal.
