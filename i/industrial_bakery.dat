50|$|Most {{types of}} breads {{available}} in other Western countries are now {{also available in}} Iceland, either baked in Iceland or imported. Everyday bread is mostly made by <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> or bought at the local bakery. However, baking at home is still a common practice amongst young and older households alike, especially in connection with having guests and celebrations. Both traditional recipes and modern/new recipes are popular, with new methods replacing older ones to some extent. Of the bread types currently available, flatbrauð (flatbread) and laufabrauð (leaf bread) have the longest traditions.|$|R

5000|$|The brewery is the {{initiative}} of Bernard Leboucq and Yvan De Baets. Leboucq set up the St. Peter's Brewery in the former lambic brewery Moriau in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw in 2003. He moved on to create Zinnebir, named after the Zinneke Parade. De Baets worked at Brouwerij De Ranke in Dottignies/Dottenijs. The two decided to start a brewery together in 2006. As the building in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw was no longer available, they brewed provisionally at the De Ranke and Proef breweries. Meanwhile the brewers searched for and found a suitable location in Brussels, a former <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery</b> in Molenbeek. A first test batch was brewed in the new premises {{at the end of}} 2010. The brewery has a reputation for brewing fine ales and [...] "frustratingly rare blends" [...] that often include lambic from the nearby Cantillon Brewery.|$|E
5000|$|Dough is {{compressed}} {{between two}} or more rotating rollers. [...] When done the right way, a smooth and consistent dough sheet is produced. The dough then passes one or several gauging rollers (mostly on conveyors) that reduce the dough to the required thickness. After this the dough sheet is shaped into a desired dough product. This technology is mainly used in industrial production machines for (semi) <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> and the food industry. Most dough sheeters can handle {{a wide variety of}} dough depending on the machine manufacturer. Most commonly dough sheeting technology is used for the production of laminated dough products like croissants and pastries, but it is also suitable for the production of bread, flatbread and pizza.|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} production of bread became notable during these years. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the {{industrial production}} of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 {{as the result of the}} amalgamation of five smaller companies. <b>Industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.|$|R
50|$|During {{the switch}} to a modern urban and industrialised society, bread types changed when large <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> {{introduced}} new soft bread, which from the early 1920s was often sweetened (sötlimpa, sweet thick bread). From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variations decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. All older bread types still exist alongside the new ones, indicating the much greater variety open to individuals today than {{has been the case}} in the past. Soft bread consumption has increased by more than 60% since the 1990s, from 30 kg to 50 kg per person and year today (2007). The older types of bread are still eaten in Sweden, but today they are usually professionally baked. New international types such as naan bread, ciabatta, focaccia, pita and bagels have been popular since the 1990s. 20% of Swedes are first- or second-generation immigrants and use bread both as they did in their home countries and as it is used today in contemporary Swedish normative food culture.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the food}} industry, quality {{assurance}} (QA) systems {{are applied to}} ensure food safety and food quality to prevent liability claims and to build and maintain trust of consumers. Bakeries apply QA systems such as Hygiene code, HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points), ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and BRC (British Retail Consortium), but {{for them to be}} able to decide which system suits their specific situation (i. e., context) most and how this system should be implemented, they lack the necessary insight into the interdependence of contextual factors of bakeries and the quality management level at which these bakeries operate. This article reports on these aspects. The contextual factors that were studied include QA system, size of organization, degree of automation and type of product group. The level of food quality management between groups of bakeries differing in these contextual factors was analysed. Differences between groups of bakeries were found in the level of the quality management activities, control of strategy, allocation of supplying raw materials, supply control, planning of production and control of execution of production tasks. Bakeries that applied BRC, bakeries with 150 employees or more, <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries,</b> and confectionery and biscuit bakeries performed some of these activities at a higher quality level than the other groups of bakeries. The study shows that by using the instrument IMAQE-Food, bakeries can select suitable quality management activities and QA systems for their specific situation to achieve effective quality management...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{evaluated}} {{the effect on}} exposure of an intervention programme, which focused on risk education and providing information on good work practices. This intervention programme was enrolled {{as part of a}} Dutch covenant in the flour processing industry (<b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries,</b> flour mills, ingredient producers). METHODS: Data from several measurement surveys collected pre- and post-intervention were used to evaluate changes in exposure over time. All datasets contained personal measurements analysed for flour dust and fungal alpha-amylase contents, and contextual information was available on process characteristics, work practice, and use of control measures. RESULTS: Changes in exposure over time varied substantially between sectors and jobs. For bakeries a modest downward annual trend of - 2 % was found for flour dust and - 8 % for amylase. For flour mills the annual trend for flour dust was - 12 %; no significant trend was observed for amylase. For ingredient producers results were generally non-significant but indicated a reduction in flour dust exposure and increase in fungal alpha-amylase exposure. Modest increase in use of control measures and proper work practices were reported in most sectors, especially the use of local exhaust ventilation and decreased use of compressed air. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the observed reductions in exposure levels indicates that the sector-wide intervention strategy implemented during the covenant period had a limited overall effect. This indicates that a more rigorous approach is needed to substantially decrease the exposure levels to flour dust and related allergens and, respectively, the prevalence of associated occupational diseases...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Salmonella {{infections are}} the most common food-born {{diseases}} transmitted from animals to humans. Epidemics of salmonellosis occur after eating improperly cooked contaminated foods. Material and methods A descriptive epidemiological method was used to analyze epidemiological characteristics of salmonellosis in Vojvodina in the period 1978 - 2003. Results During this period there were 26 851 cases of salmonellosis (mean annual incidence of 51. 1 / 100 000 and mean annual mortality of 0. 9 / 100 000). Mean annual case fatality ratio during this period was 0. 1 %. The specific incidence was highest in 12 - 24 month-old children (251 / 100 000), and lowest in the oldest age group (13. 9 / 100 000). Lethality was highest in children younger than 1 year, and persons older than 50 years (84 %). The number of cases registered in food-born epidemics makes 41. 7 % of all registered cases. A mayority of 772 registered epidemics were small epidemics among families, relatives and friends. The great epidemics with large number of infected persons were due to an <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery</b> with 1713 ill persons and a public restaurant with 311 ill persons during the 80 's. An epidemic was due to sandwiches from an <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery</b> distributed through the whole territory of Vojvodina with the highest incidence of salmonellosis in 1987 (137. 7 / 100 000). The most common serotype was S. enteritidis (69. 7 %), but 68 more serotypes were isolated. The most common cause of epidemics were eggs and egg products (76. 2 %). Salmonella spp. was isolated from food in small number of epidemics (less than 20 %), because epidemics were discovered usually 2 or 3 days after their beginning. ...|$|E
40|$|URL] {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were determined {{in a number}} of foodstuffs purchased in various locations near a hazardous waste incinerator (HWI) in Tarragona County (Catalonia, Spain). The dietary intake of PCDD/Fs by the population of the area under potential influence of the HWI was subsequently estimated. The results were compared with previous surveys performed in the same area in 1998 (baseline), 2002 and 2006. In the present study, the highest WHO-TEQ corresponded to <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery</b> (0. 183 ng/kg wet weight, ww), followed by fish (0. 156 ng/kg ww), oils and fats (0. 112 ng/kg fat weight), and seafood (0. 065 ng/kg ww). In contrast, the lowest values were observed in pulses and tubers (0. 003 ng/kg ww), and cereals and fruits (0. 004 ng/kg ww). The dietary intake of PCDD/Fs by the general population was 33. 1 pg WHO-TEQ/day, having fish and seafood (11. 6 pg WHO-TEQ), oils and fats (4. 61 pg WHO-TEQ), dairy products (3. 79 pg WHO-TEQ), and <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery</b> (3. 49 pg WHO-TEQ) as the groups showing the highest contribution to the total TEQ. The lowest daily contributions corresponded to pulses (0. 08 pg WHO-TEQ) and tubers (0. 25 pg WHO-TEQ). This intake was considerably lower than that found in the baseline study, 210. 1 pg I-TEQ/day, and also notably lower than that found in the 2002 survey (59. 6 pg I-TEQ/day), but slightly higher than the intake estimated in the 2006 survey, 27. 8 pg WHO-TEQ/day. The results of this study show that any increase potentially found in the biological monitoring of the general population living in the area under evaluation should not be attributed to dietary exposure to PCDD/Fs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a combination of}} a 3 D laser sensor and a line-base SLAM algorithm which together produce 2 D line maps of highly cluttered indoor environments. The key of the described method is the replacement of commonly used 2 D laser range sensors by 3 D perception. A straightforward algorithm extracts a virtual 2 D scan that also contains partially occluded walls. These virtual scans are used as input for SLAM using line segments as features. The paper presents the used algorithms and experimental results that were made in a former <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery.</b> The focus lies on scenes that are known to be problematic for pure 2 D systems. The results demonstrate that mapping indoor environments can be made robust with respect to both, poor odometry and clutter. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Occupational {{allergen}} {{exposure assessment}} usually requires airborne dust sampling at the worksite followed by dust extraction and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis at the laboratory. Use of semiquantitative lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) may allow a more rapid detection procedure with direct on-site demonstration of a bioallergen exposure hazard. Objective In a field study, we evaluated a recently developed LFIA for fungal alpha-amylase, an important bakery allergen. Methods Airborne and surface dust (wipe) samples and samples from flours and baking additives {{used at the}} workplace were collected in 5 <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> and tested in the LFIA for fungal amylase. For comparison, amylase was measured in sample eluates with the reference EIA method. Results Sensitivity of the LFIA was 1 to 10 ng/mL, and of EIA, 25 pg/mL. In LFIA, most flour samples, 84 % of wipe samples, 26 % of personal airborne dust, {{and none of the}} 26 ambient air dust samples produced a visible reaction. Wipe samples from dough-making areas and flour samples gave the strongest reactions. All extracts with > 5 ng allergen per milliliter showed a positive LFIA reaction. Conclusion The LFIA for fungal amylase is an easy and rapid method to demonstrate the allergen directly at the worksite in less than 10 to 20 minutes. Similar LFIA methods may be used for other occupational allergens in other work environments. Clinical implications Lateral flow immunoassays for occupational allergens may be of great value in occupational hygiene surveys to demonstrate directly to workers and supervisors the hazards of work-related bioallergen exposure...|$|R
40|$|The global food {{industry}} {{continues to grow}} through mergers and acquisitions. The consolidation of grocery chains has necessarily led to increasingly large, heavily industrialized food processing firms. These manufacturers rely on large-scale, automated and mechanized production technologies to deliver controlled, consistent, and safe products to retailers. Using Braverman’s (1974) deskilling thesis, and Standing’s (1992) three-part definition of skill {{as the basis for}} investigation, this research explores the effects of technological changes on the skills of food workers and focuses on the baking industry. The primary research site is the in-store bakery of a Co-op grocery store in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Observation took place over a two-week period, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with the bakers in the facility. Other research sites included two large-scale <b>industrial</b> <b>bakeries</b> in western Canada and a flour milling facility in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The bread-making processes involved at the research sites are compared, and the impact of the technologies on the skills of workers at each site is discussed. The findings from the research support Braverman’s deskilling thesis that bakers in the industrialized food system are experiencing deskilling. This erosion of skills is not only a result of the technological changes, but also, more importantly, the result of the social relations of production. The research also explores Human Resources and Social Development Canada’s Essential Skills program. The findings of the research support the argument that the Essential Skills program is a classification scheme that is rooted in scientific management, and can serve to marginalize workers employed in non-knowledge-based occupations. Discussion of the findings also points toward the need to investigate different forms of ownership and their role in preserving the skills and knowledge of workers...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a multi-agent system (MAS) for the logistics control of Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{that are used}} in the dough making process at an <b>industrial</b> <b>bakery.</b> Here, logistics control refers to constructing robust schedules for all transportation jobs. The paper discusses how alternative MAS designs can be developed and compared using cost, frequency of messages between agents, and computation time for evaluating control rules as performance indicators. Qualitative design guidelines turn out to be insufficient to select the best agent architecture. Therefore, we also use simulation to support decision making, where we use real-life data from the bakery to evaluate several alternative designs. We find that architectures in which line agents initiate allocation of transportation jobs, and AGV agents schedule multiple jobs in advance, perform best. We conclude by discussing the benefits of our MAS systems design approach for real-life applications...|$|E

5000|$|The Campbell Baking Company is a {{historic}} building located in Waterloo, Iowa, United States. Built in 1927, the single-story, yellow brick structure is basically a utilitarian building with Spanish Revival decorative elements on its primary and secondary façades. An addition from the early 1930s compliments the original building, while additions from 1957 and 1977 do not. [...] The last addition incorporated an unrelated brick building into the bakery complex. The original building was designed by the Toledo, Ohio architectural firm of Mills, Rhines, Bellman & Nordhoff, and built by the John G. Miller Construction Company. The building represents the consolidation of the bakery industry in the early 20th century from neighborhood retail bakers to local wholesalers to national <b>industrial</b> wholesale <b>bakery</b> companies. [...] The Campbell Baking Company entered the Waterloo market as a financial backer of the Peerless Baking Company, which was formed in 1917.
