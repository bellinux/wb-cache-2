5|$|In particular, {{directed}} cycle graphs n with n prime are all <b>incomparable.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of such graphs, with simultaneously increasing values of both parameters, gives infinitely many <b>incomparable</b> graphs (an antichain in the homomorphism preorder).|$|E
5|$|For example, the Grötzsch graph is 4-chromatic and {{triangle}}-free (it has girth 4 and odd girth 5), {{so it is}} <b>incomparable</b> to {{the triangle}} graph K3.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} <b>incomparable</b> graphs {{with respect to}} the {{homomorphism}} preorder, that is, pairs of graphs such that neither admits a homomorphism into the other.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, if G has {{strictly}} larger odd girth than H and strictly larger chromatic number than H, then G and H are <b>incomparable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{directed}} graphs, it is {{much easier}} to find <b>incomparable</b> pairs. For example, consider the directed cycle graphs n, with vertices 1, 2, …, n and edges from i to i + 1 (for i = 1, 2, …, n − 1) and from n to 1.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} <b>incomparable</b> {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E
5|$|While off {{the coast}} of Ireland on 8 October, Emerald rescued a British brig by {{capturing}} <b>Incomparable,</b> an 8-gun French privateer. The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when Emerald intervened. <b>Incomparable</b> had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of Saint-Malo, but had not yet captured any other vessel. Still in Irish waters on 6 November, Emerald took the 16-gun French brig , two days out of Brest and bound for Guadeloupe. After an all-night chase, Emerald caught up. Capitaine de fregate Croquet Deschateurs of Fanfaron resisted, firing several broadsides and a final double-shotted broadside. Unable to escape, Deschateurs prepared to board but Emerald evaded the manouvre and fired a broadside that dismasted Fanfaron, leaving Deschateurs no option but to surrender his vessel. The subsequent French court-martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss but also commended him for his conduct. Four days later Emerald arrived at Cork with Fanfaron and Luna. Fanfaron, with a crew of 113, had been carrying a cargo of flour, salt, and other provisions, as well as iron, lead, and nails, all for Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of entertainment, Mutual built on the <b>incomparable</b> success of The Shadow. WGN's Chicago Theater of the Air, {{featuring}} hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast {{for the first time}} in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. Chicago Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955. Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, reprising their roles from the Universal film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. The Mysterious Traveler, a proto–Twilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of the new}} medium's biggest attractions {{came from}} {{vaudeville}} and the musical theater, where performers such as Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed {{to the demands of}} both dialogue and song. James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Bebe Daniels, William Powell, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the <b>incomparable</b> Charlie Chaplin, whose City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise, as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters (1928). Greta Garbo was the one non–native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom {{on both sides of the}} great sound divide. Silent film extra Clark Gable, who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades. The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West, William Faulkner, Robert Sherwood, Aldous Huxley, and Dorothy Parker.|$|E

25|$|Chartres Cathedral {{contains}} an <b>incomparable</b> range of stained glass, {{including some of}} the earliest in situ in the world. It also has three richly carved Gothic portals of which the stylised 12th-century figures of the western Royal Portal are the earliest.|$|E
25|$|In other words, a largest {{family of}} <b>incomparable</b> subsets of X is {{obtained}} by selecting the subsets of X that have median size. The Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality also concerns antichains {{in a power}} set {{and can be used}} to prove Sperner's theorem.|$|E
25|$|The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry forbade the {{practices}} and gods of ancient Akkad, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. The Hebrew Bible states that God has no shape or form, is utterly <b>incomparable,</b> is everywhere and cannot {{be represented in}} a physical form of an idol.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} relation = on any set is also {{a partial}} order in which every two distinct elements are <b>incomparable.</b> It is also the only relation that is both a partial order and an equivalence relation. Many advanced properties of posets are interesting mainly for non-linear orders.|$|E
25|$|Johnston {{worked with}} doom metal band Waves of Mercury on their 2013 EP As Seasons Fleet.

Baldock suffered from illness in his final years. He died of pneumonia and kidney failure on 2 February 2011 following a fourth stroke.|$|E
25|$|We loyally went {{on using}} the script {{inherited}} from our forefathers. We clung tenaciously to our runes, {{longer than any}} other nation.

25|$|The Seventh Key {{takes the}} form of a small, golden key. Unlike the other Keys, this Key is paramount, {{retaining}} its full, sovereign power anywhere in the House or Secondary Realms. Among its powers seem to be the ability to suppress the powers of other keys, and confer a greater power upon the wielder. It gives dominion over the <b>Incomparable</b> Gardens and Sunday.|$|E
25|$|The Sixth Key {{takes the}} form of a quill pen. It can be used to write {{extremely}} powerful spells that are capable of creating illusions and wiping out large numbers of the creatures of the <b>Incomparable</b> Gardens, among other things. Saturday is also seen combining the power of the Key with ordinary sorcery. It gives dominion over the Upper House and Saturday.|$|E
25|$|This, {{like the}} {{creation}} of a bird, was a miracle of <b>incomparable</b> nature, one that should have caused the Jews to believe in the prophethood of Jesus without any doubt. Islam agrees with Christianity that Jesus brought people back from the dead. The first three accounts are mentioned in both Islam and the Bible, save the last, which is only mentioned in Islam.|$|E
25|$|The hall is {{the west}} {{suburban}} {{home of the}} Chicago Sinfonietta, {{and the home of}} the DuPage Symphony Orchestra.

The Canadian quintet Canadian Brass, formed by Gene Watts and Charles Daellenbach, is a recurring guest at the hall.|$|E
25|$|Gunther Schuller {{wrote in}} 1989:Ellington {{composed}} incessantly {{to the very}} last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was <b>incomparable</b> and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be {{recognized as one of}} the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.|$|E
25|$|Manchester Airport is {{the third}} busiest airport in the United Kingdom after Heathrow and Gatwick. The city also has an {{extensive}} network of canal systems which converge into Manchester. The Manchester Ship Canal, built in 1894, was the largest ship canal in the world on opening and is <b>incomparable</b> to any other canal in the United Kingdom, which are mostly built for narrowboats and barges.|$|E
25|$|Shiva sensed this catastrophe, and {{his rage}} was <b>incomparable.</b> He created Virabhadra and Bhadrakali, two ferocious creatures who wreaked havoc and mayhem {{on the scene}} of the horrific incident. Two temples on the island of Nainativu {{propagate}} the worship of these energies - namely Nainai Virabhadra Temple and Nainai Kali Amman Temple. Nearly all those present were indiscriminately felled overnight. Dakshin himself was decapitated.|$|E
25|$|The Academy’s {{museum is}} {{home to one of}} the world’s most {{significant}} collections of musical instruments and artefacts, including stringed instruments by Stradivari, Guarneri, and members of the Amati family; manuscripts by Purcell, Handel and Vaughan Williams; and an <b>incomparable</b> and growing collection of performing materials that belonged to leading performers. It is a constituent college of the University of London and a registered charity under English law.|$|E
25|$|Political {{instability}} soon returned, {{social unrest}} being the disagreeable norm. The conservative {{renovation of the}} Republic's institutions was abandoned and taken apart. Eventually the decisive civil war victory of the <b>incomparable</b> Julius Caesar (100–44), followed by his executive mastery and public-minded reforms, appeared as the necessary and welcome step forward toward resolution of the sorry and bloody débâcle at Rome. This, in the dramatic narrative of Theodore Mommsen.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} this {{characterization}} depend on the choice of set-theoretic axiomatization used to formalize mathematics. In particular, in models of set theory for which Martin's axiom is true and the continuum hypothesis is false, the class of bipartite graphs in this characterization can {{be replaced by a}} single forbidden minor. However, for models in which the continuum hypothesis is true, this class contains graphs which are <b>incomparable</b> with each other in the minor ordering.|$|E
25|$|This period {{also saw}} growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was {{a golden age}} for the French, who led by the <b>incomparable</b> Puig Aubert, {{travelled}} to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were greeted by an estimated 100,000 fans in Marseille. They repeated the feat in France 1952–53 and again in Australia in 1955.|$|E
25|$|The 1/3–2/3 {{conjecture}} {{is known}} to be true for certain special classes of partial orders, including partial orders of width two, partial orders of height two, partial orders with at most 11 elements, partial orders in which each element is <b>incomparable</b> to at most six others, series-parallel partial orders, and semiorders. In the limit as n goes to infinity, the proportion of n-element partial orders that obey the 1/3–2/3 conjecture approaches 100%.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Alcibiades {{goes on to}} {{describe}} Socrates' virtues, his <b>incomparable</b> valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, but {{before you know it}} you will have fallen in love with him.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the early}} fifties {{the team was}} weak. The signing of the Australian leg break bowler Bruce Dooland, arrested the decline but until {{the signing of the}} <b>incomparable</b> Garfield Sobers in 1968, the team was weak. Sobers hit Malcolm Nash of Glamorgan for six sixes in an over in a County Championship game at Swansea in his first season. Mike Harris scored heavily in the 1970s, {{including}} nine centuries in 1971 but apart from Barry Stead, the bowling lacked penetration.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, God is {{understood}} to be the absolute one, indivisible, and <b>incomparable</b> being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Judaism holds that YHWH, the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the national god of the Israelites, delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, and gave them the Law of Moses at biblical Mount Sinai {{as described in the}} Torah. Traditional interpretations of Judaism generally emphasize that God is personal, while some modern interpretations of Judaism emphasize that God is a force or ideal.|$|E
