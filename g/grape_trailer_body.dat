50|$|The large {{trailers}} {{pulled by}} a tractor unit come in many styles, lengths, and shapes. Some common types are: vans, reefers, flatbeds, sidelifts and tankers. These trailers may be refrigerated, heated, ventilated, or pressurized, depending on climate and cargo. Some trailers have movable wheel axles {{that can be}} adjusted by moving them on a track underneath the <b>trailer</b> <b>body</b> and securing them in place with large pins. The purpose {{of this is to}} help adjust weight distribution over the various axles, to comply with local laws.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} {{began with}} the importation in 1898 of two Benz cars from Paris by William McLean. Apart from a few early attempts to build complete cars all chassis were imported. Local coachbuilders, out-priced, finally disappeared in the 1920s though not without representations to government. A few moved to assembly of complete cars or to making bus, truck and <b>trailer</b> <b>bodies,</b> sometimes both.

2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot highway trailers in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway <b>trailer</b> <b>body</b> without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the {{motorhome}} date back to 1910, when the Pierce-Arrow motor company introduced the Touring Landau model at the Madison Square Garden auto show. [...] The Pierce-Arrow’s entry was specialized for the camper in mind—providing cargo compartments for camping equipment and even an on-board toilet. [...] In the 1920s, individual builders and manufactures began to convert panel trucks and buses {{to be used for}} camping. Designers patterned these housecars after airplanes, boats, and buses. [...] RV production was halted during World War Two and would not resume for tourists until the 1950s. [...] When production did resume, designers began grafting <b>trailer</b> <b>bodies</b> onto truck or bus chassis.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 1974 by Greyhound Bus Lines to {{manufacture}} Motor Coach Industries vehicles. In 1987, General Motors decided to close its bus division and sold the manufacturing rights of the Rapid Transit Series (RTS) bus and the Classic to Greyhound subsidiary, Motor Coach Industries. RTS production would move to the TMC plant in Roswell, New Mexico, while the Classic bus production would remain in the former GM bus plant in Saint-Eustache, Quebec. Motor Coach Industries sold its Classic and RTS bus license to Nova Bus in 1993.In 1990, TMC began development of an enclosed automobile-transport semitrailer. This trailer used small-diameter wheels to maximize interior space, and robotic arms to lift the automobiles and position them closely together in the <b>trailer</b> <b>body.</b> The <b>trailer</b> lacked the traditional ramps and racks: automobiles were fitted with pins strapped to the tires, which slotted into holders inside the trailer. These features maximized {{the capacity of the}} trailer.|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 {{presents}} a literature review {{concerned with the}} background to trailer steering, rollover prevention, vehicle parameter and state estimation, and integrated steering and braking. Chapter 2 presents simulation results of various brake actuation events on articulated vehicles with path following control. It is shown that the vehicle is stable under braking with path following control provided the Anti-lock Braking System is functioning. Active trailer steering can compensate the changing direction of <b>trailer</b> <b>body</b> caused by the braking forces and thus maintain the vehicle’s yaw stability. Chapter 3 and 4 present a strategy for estimating vehicle parameters and states. Chapter 5 develops an optimal active trailer steering controller at high speeds and a PID controller at low speeds. Simulations show that the active trailer steering controller can reduce lateral acceleration significantly, while maintaining acceptable path error. The active steering vehicle improves the roll stability by reducing the lateral acceleration of trailer CoG up to 27 % while maintaining path tracking performance {{as good as a}} passive vehicle at high speeds. It is more manoeuvrable at low speeds, reducing the tyre wear and causing less road damage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{motorized}} vehicle used for garbage transportation in Sri Lanka is the tractor {{with an open}} trailer. Garbage is transported in an open system causing unpleasantness, pollution, bad smell, poor hygiene and over spillage. The objective of the proposed design {{is to improve the}} capacity of garbage handled by the open tractor-trailer per each transport cycle and to improvise a closed system for waste transport to improve hygienic standards. The proposed design is one in which an existing tractor-trailer is modified to a rear loading trailer. While loading, the garbage will be compacted using a hydraulic system to overcome the low productivity. A hydraulic pump, solenoid valves, hydraulic cylinders and an electrical system are used for this construction. Apart from this, the <b>trailer</b> <b>body</b> is modified into a closed body. The measured value of solid waste currently handled per single load which is approximately 1000 kg, will be improved to about 2000 kg per load. The closed system will minimise the environmental pollution present in the existing system. These modifications to the existing tractor trailer would help to improve the present standards of, solid waste management at a relatively low cost. The cost of installation of the hydraulic system and constructing a closed body IS approximately seven hundred thousand rupees.

50|$|The {{fusion of}} both tradesmen's {{businesses}} in 1956 in Donautal made Kögel {{one of the}} first businesses to settle in the new industrial area. The transition from a tradesmen's business to an industrial concern was completed when production started in the new generously dimensioned manufacturing workshops in the Donautal industrial area. Industrial production of <b>trailers</b> and <b>bodies</b> had begun and continuous growth was achieved. However, special projects were also handled in addition to this manufacture, e.g. a 9-seater cab for the 70 kW Kaelbletractor.|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this project}} was to instrument the new MnDOT Navistar truck used at MN Road. A rugged data acquisition, data recording and wireless transmission system was established for collection of various sensor signals from the truck. The truck was instrumented with a suite of 20 accelerometers, with these accelerometers being located both on the five axles {{of the truck and}} on the tractor and <b>trailer</b> <b>bodies.</b> In addition, the truck was instrumented with a differential GPS system and an inertial measurement unit in the tractor cab. A cRIO-based data acquisition system, a rugged laptop and Labview software together serve as a flexible platform for data acquisition. A wireless communication system has been established to communicate trigger signals to roadside cabinets when the truck is at desired GPS locations on the road. Data recording by in-pavement sensors is triggered by this system. Software has also been set up for automatic downloading of data from the truck to a server on the network at MN Road. The experimental performance of the developed system has been verified by multiple tests conducted by the research team. The above instrumentation of the truck will enable data collection on truck vibrations, enable analysis of correlations between truck vibrations and variations in signals of weigh-inmotion sensors, and enable recording of truck movements and pavement loads at MnROAD.

Kleason was believed to have held a grudge against the LDS Church after he felt church members did not support him during a poaching trial.|$|R
40|$|Obtaining a {{representative}} loading spectrum that corresponds {{well to the}} reality {{is still one of}} the greatest challenges for fatigue life calculations and optimal design of the <b>trailer</b> <b>body.</b> A good qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the spectrum leads to more efficient usage of material, a better design of connection points and an overall decrease of the weight of the trailer, which finally results in a significant decrease in the price of a ton of cargo per km. Despite that, the approach is nowadays mostly based on the experience and rules of thumb. It typically results in over-dimensioning of some parts while other parts remain vulnerable to failure due to unknown loading patterns. This paper describes a generic approach to solve the problems mentioned above applied in a research project named FORWARD (Fuel Optimized trailer Referring to Well Assessed Realistic Design loads). The project lasted two years and was carried out in cooperation with several different trailer manufacturers and 1 st tier suppliers. The loading history of more than 1000 hours for five trailer types were captured in the shape of strains, accelerations and velocities of various elements of the trailers, enabling reconstruction of the loading in terms of forces and moments acting on the wheels and kingpin. Parallel to this extensive test-campaign, a novel generic physics-based computational approach was developed to predict selected loads encountered during common manoeuvres to all trailer types. The computational approach was validated against test-data and resulted in creating a generic multi-body library applicable for all trailer types, and an automated post-processing routine for the large amount of test-data...|$|R
