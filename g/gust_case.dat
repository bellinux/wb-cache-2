A number of Design of Experiments, surrogate modeling and optimization techniques are applied in order to determine meta-models encompassing the entire flight envelope and different fuel cases using only a few test points. All of the methodologies are compared on data from a simple, assumed modes, free-free aircraft model with 5 ”interesting quantities”, and are shown to determine accurate predictions of the worst <b>gust</b> <b>case</b> with far fewer gust response calculations than a conventional Monte-Carlo approach...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} Reduced Order Model (ROM) for a frequency domain aerodynamic model based on functional or Volterra series expansion is presented. It {{relies on the}} numerical identification of the higher order Volterra Kernels by a continuous time impulse method and the transformation into the frequency domain with multidimensional Fourier transforms. This frequency domain ROM allows the nonlinear computation of the output power spectra as function of the input power spectra, showing an independence on the randomness of the phase for Gaussian stationary processes. Gust and continuous turbulence encounters are considered for a rigid wing empennage configuration flying in the transonic regime. Results obtained with the nonlinear frequency domain ROM are compared against CFD Euler computations for a discrete <b>gust</b> <b>case</b> showing a very good agreement. For continuous turbulence encounters {{the influence of the}} nonlinearity in the root mean square of the output when increasing the turbulence intensity is considered, showing a cubic dependency with the root mean square value of the turbulence for a second order Volterra series expansion. Additionally, convergence issues experienced by full-order CFD simulations when the turbulence intensity is increased are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the preliminary studies for introducing advanced light weight truss based structural concepts in civil aircraft structures. The structure is an unconventional structure with Iso-truss T-section spar, rib and orthogonal grid skin which replaces full web J- - section spar and rib. The {{role of the}} skin is mainly to obtain aerodynamic shape and transfer the load to the sub structure. The skin buckling is avoided by introducing the orthogonal grid. The main loading members are rib and spar. A truss based test box has been designed, analyzed, fabricated and tested between stations 1 to 4 on LHS of HT in GFRP material. The overall dimension of the fabricated box is 780 mm* 1260 mm* 192 mm, which includes four truss rib stations, four truss spars, and three skin stiffeners. Tensile tests {{have been carried out}} on GRFP laminates and elemental truss elements for arriving at the material property. A static deflection test has been carried out for PSD <b>Gust</b> <b>case</b> which is the critical load case for a typical civil aircraft HT which has magnitude of load in the order of 1177 Kg on LHS and 491 Kg on RHS. The GFRP segment is loaded upto 40 % of critical load of LHS where maximum deflection of 21. 4 mm was observed experimentally. The deflections are monitored at the tip station 4 and compared with FE model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe flow over a {{flat plate}} at a Reynolds number of 750 is numerically {{investigated}} via fine large-eddy simulation (LES), first at normal (90) {{and then at}} oblique (45) incidence flow direction with a uniform steady inlet. The results are {{in complete agreement with}} the direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experimental data, thereby serving as a validation for the present simulations. For the normal (90) uniform inflow case, coherent vortices are alternately shed from both leading edges of the plate, whereas for the oblique (45) uniform inflow case the vortices shed from {{the two sides of the}} plate interact strongly resulting in a quasi-periodic force response. The normal flat plate is then analysed with an incident gust signal with varying amplitude and time period. For these incident coherent <b>gust</b> <b>cases,</b> a reference test case with variable coherent inlet is first studied and the results are compared to a steady inlet simulation, with a detailed analysis of the flow behaviour and the wake response under the incident gust. Finally, the flat plate response to 16 different gust profiles is studied. A transient drag reconstruction for these incident coherent <b>gust</b> <b>cases</b> is then presented based on a frequency-dependent transfer function and phase spectrum analysis...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} model order reduction of high fidelity coupled fluid/structure/flight dynamics models and the subsequent control design is described. It uses information on the eigenspectrum of the coupled-system Jacobian matrix and projects the system through a series expansion onto a small basis of eigenvectors representative of the full-model dynamics. A nonlinear reduced order model is derived and is exploited for a worst <b>case</b> <b>gust</b> and adaptive control design. The investigation focuses on a flight control design based on the model reference adaptive control scheme via the Lyapunov stability approach. The novelty {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, it uses a single nonlinear reduced model for parametric worst <b>case</b> <b>gust</b> search. Secondly, it is shown that it makes feasible an implementation of a complex control methodology for a large nonlinear system. The adaptive controller is able to alleviate gust loads for a three degrees-of-freedom aerofoil and for an unmanned aerial vehicle. An investigation for the adaptation parameters is performed and their effect on control input actuation and aeroelastic closed-loop response is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} preliminary studies relating to introducing advanced light weight truss based structural concepts in civil aircraft structures. A typical civil aircraft horizontal tail (HT) segment has been considered. The proposed composite structure is an unconventional structure with Iso-truss T-section spar, rib and orthogonal grid skin replacing the conventional full web, and thicker skin. The truss elements are made out of polyurethane foam and glass braids. Wet layup technique {{is used for the}} truss element, T-section and skin. The epoxy resin 5052 system is used. Both the main loading members (rib and spar) are made of the truss elements. The role of the skin is mainly to give an aerodynamic shape and transfer the load to the sub structure comprising of truss elements. The skin buckling is avoided by introducing the orthogonal grid. A GFRP truss based segment of HT has been designed, analyzed, fabricated and tested. The overall dimension of the fabricated segment is 780 * 1260 * 192 mm. Tensile tests have been carried out on Bi-directional GRFP (0 / 90) laminates and elemental truss elements for obtaining the material properties. A static test has been carried out on truss structure for <b>Gust</b> <b>case</b> which is the critical load case. The full load acting on the segment is 636 Kg. The GFRP segment is loaded up to 30 % of full load (191 Kg). For this load of 191 kg the maximum deflection of 14. 28 mm was observed. The deflections are monitored at the end rib and compared with the NASTRAN FE model. The correlation between analysis and testing is good. The truss based construction improves the stiffness of the structure and weight saving compared to the conventional method of fabrication. This paper details the design, analysis and fabrication of the truss based concepts on the HT segment...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{results from}} a finite element {{analysis}} of rotodomed aircraft are presented. Automatic Multistage Substructuring Scheme (AMSS) in CSA/NASTRAN has been effectively used in the modelling of rotodomed aircraft. The results presented correspond to four critical load cases - one vertical <b>gust</b> load <b>case</b> Vs {{and the other three}} side load cases. Detailed numerical results for these loading cases are presented in the form of tables containing displacements and stresses at salient points on the structure. In addition, deformed shapes, stress contours etc. of different components are also presented. It is found that the stresses in platform, pylons and fuselage are well within the allowable limits except for a few points in the region of intersection of pylons with the fuselage. The finite element sub-structuring modelling details of the rotodomed aircraft were reported in an earlier report...|$|R

The United Gust fronts produce low altitude wind shear that can be hazardous to aircraft operations, especially during takeoff and landing. Radar meteorologists have long been able to identify gust front signatures in Doppler radar data, but in order to use the radars efficiently, automatic detection of such hazards is essential. Eight <b>gust</b> front <b>case</b> studies are presented. The data include photographs of the Doppler weather radar displays, thermodynamic and wind measurements from a 440 m high tower, environmental soundings and tables of gust front characteristics. The tabulated characteristics are those thought to be most important in developing rules for automatic gust fron...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanism}} of limit-cycle excitation is investigated for an aeroelastic system with structural nonlinearities. The analysis is performed on a simplified acroelastic model retaining only two structural modes (first bending and first torsional modes) and with a simplified description of both unsteady loads due to wing oscillation and external <b>gust</b> excitation. Two <b>cases</b> are considered, without and with gust excitation. In the first case, normal form analysis is employed to give an approximation of the basin of attraction of stable limit cycles {{in the space of}} initial conditions.

40|$|In this paper, {{aerodynamic}} gust {{responses are}} presented which are calculated using the DLM-correction method iSKEM [1]. iSKEM uses quasi-steady CFD data {{in order to}} enhance the DLM-based results. Comparisons between DLM, CFD and iSKEM for a rigid 3 D swept wing show that the steady-state properties of the flowfield, such as separation and recompression-shocks, should always be taken into account. Quasi-steady corrections are only sufficient in the linear range of the steady lift polar and only for small <b>gust</b> amplitudes. In <b>case</b> of high angles of attack, i. e. with flow separation, steady corrections are not sufficient. Moreover, for high gust amplitudes even at low angles of attack linear methods {{will not be able to}} calculate the actually occurring load peaks...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a passive gust alleviation device (PGAD) mounted at the wingtip of aircraft in conventional and flying-wing configurations have been studied in previous research. However the PGAD influence on the aeroelastic stability in particular the body freedom flutter (BFF) of a flying-wing aircraft remains as a concern. This present investigation is focused on evaluating the beneficial effect of PGAD on both gust load alleviation and BFF of a small flying-wing aircraft of high aspect ratio wing made of composite. A small range of (1 -cos) type of gust load has been considered to select a representative critical <b>gust</b> load <b>case</b> for the study. A parametric study indicates {{that there is a}} narrow band of optimal key parameters for the PGAD design. Subsequently a set of optimal parameters is selected to further the analysis of the PGAD mechanism. The case study results show that the PGAD can make the bending moment at the wing root due to gust reduced by 16 %. In addition, the BFF speed of the flying-wing aircraft is increased by 4. 2 %. The investigation reveals that the PGAD mode and its interaction with the wing bending mode and short period oscillation of the aircraft can have beneficial aeroelastic effect on both gust alleviation and flutter suppression...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{analysis}} of {{an assemblage of}} HS- 748 fuselage, pylons and platform is carried out employing relatively coarse finite element model, using ASKA (Automatic System for Kinematic Analysis) software package. Extensive results were earlier obtained by the NAL project team adopting a fine mesh using Automatic Multi-Stage Sub-structure (AMSS) scheme of CSA/NASTRAN (NAsa STRuctural ANalysis) software package for Symmetric Vertical <b>Gust</b> Load <b>case</b> (Vg). Deflection values obtained from simple beam {{analysis of}} some of the platform members were also reported. The static analysis presented in this document has two distinct highlights. Firstly, the program package ASKA is used instead of NASTRAN and secondly the total number of nodes are determined at such that single step analysis can reasonably be performed without resorting to sub-structure scheme. The results namely displacements and stresses are presented in the form of tables and plots of deformed shapes. Incidentally, {{during the course of the}} analysis a bug in the CSA/NASTRAN was detected namely the stress recovery for the BAR (beam) elements having linearly varying offset centroidal axis was largely erroneous. The revised results just obtained by the project team introducing constant offset of centroidal axis for all BAR (beam) elements are in good agreement with ASKA results presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of design loads and requirements is defining the structural weight of airplanes and their safety. Therefore {{the definition of}} requirements should be performed very critically by the customer and structural weight should be assessed based on sensitivity analysis of the total aircraft which includes flight manoeuvre simulation, flight control system, aerodynamics and elastic effects introduced by finite elements. To produce these analyses {{is the job of}} the aircraft companies. After {{selection of}} most load critical flight manoeuvres (pull up manoeuvres, initiation of roll manoeuvres etc.) the calculation of airloads and inertia loads must include the flight control system and its failure cases because it affects the motion of the control surfaces and therefore the aircraft. With the advent of carbon fibre composite structures discrete loads are the predominant limiting design conditions but it should be emphasised that most structures are of a hybrid nature with metal frame which are still susceptible to fatigue loads. For airplanes designed to civil requirements such as transport airplanes, tankers etc. the definition of continuous turbulence and inclusion of FCS failure cases and nonlinearities such as control surface angles is extremely important. There was a long way from load assumptions used by the Wright Brothers who designed their Flyer to a 5 g limit to the load limiting capabilities of the care free handling flight control system of the Eurofighter. Also the US-Airforce Mil-Specifications which were used to design NATO airplanes such as Tornado, F 16 and F 18 in the 1970 ’s are obsolete today and the MIL-A- 87221 (USAF) is only a frame without the essential quantitative material. All these issues are addressed in this manual including comparisons of regulations and descriptions of new specifications. Complete procedures how to establish design loads are presented which should help for the design of new airplanes. The importance of dynamic phenomena which produce design loads for various aircraft parts such as intakes, leading edges etc. is also highlighted. Loads monitoring systems are necessary to prove calculated loads and monitor fatigue loads to establish the remaining structural life. There is a description of a modern system. For transport type aircraft <b>gust</b> load <b>cases</b> are the most critical for strength design and they are also the main fatigue loading source for the major part of the structure. Methods for discrete and continuous <b>gust</b> loading <b>cases</b> are presented together with nonlinear example calculations. In the appendix there is a description of failure cases and their effect on loads for transport aircraft and a specification of a landing gear which could be used as an example how to specify the whole structure as a system. The military use of this manual is to establish procedures to build the lightest structure for the military requirements. Agreement on requirements and design loads within the NATO countries could standardise pilot training, aircraft usage, increase aircraft life and reduce maintenance. Since the search of the best usage of the aircraft for its military purpose will continue to integrate structure and avionics such as fire and flight control systems as an example there will be a continuous need for future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of gust response problems {{is a crucial}} and, if high accuracy is desired, time consuming task. Since linear frequency domain methods have previously shown significant reduction in computational cost for motion-induced aerodynamics, an extension towards gust excitation is proposed. Time-domain signals are reconstructed by a superposition of responses at several discrete frequencies. Once frequency domain solutions are available, a reduced order model is constructed projecting the linearised Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a combined modal basis. While eigenmodes are accurate in predicting structural vibration, additional modes from proper orthogonal decomposition capture aerodynamic effects due to gust excitation. For all methods a two-dimensional NACA 0012 aerofoil is investigated at sub- and transonic conditions. Limitations of the linearised approach are first outlined by increasing the gust amplitude at both operating points. Subsequently, a worst <b>case</b> <b>gust</b> length search is performed and it is shown that the computational cost is reduced case dependent by several orders of magnitude compared to the original system...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{conceptions of}} the {{circulation}} theory of airfoils are reviewed briefly, and the mechanism by which a "wake" of vorticity is produced by an airfoil in non-uniform motion is pointed out. After a calculation of the induction effects of a wake vortex, it is shown how the lift and moment acting upon an airfoil in the two-dimensional case may be calculated directly from simple physical considerations of momentum and moment of momentum. Formulae for the lift and moment are then obtained which are applicable to all cases of motion of a two-dimensional thin airfoil in which the wake produced is approximately flat; i. e., in which {{the movement of the}} airfoil normal to its mean path is small. The general results are applied first to the case of an oscillating airfoil, and vector diagrams giving the magnitudes and phase angles of the lift and moment are obtained. The results of a sudden change of angle of attack are then determined, and a general method for handling transient cases is set up. This method is applied to the calculation of the lift and moment acting on an airfoil entering sharp-edged and graded <b>gusts.</b> The <b>case</b> of a series of sinusoidal gusts is also considered. A method of calculating the distribution of forces over the airfoil chord is then shown, and it is applied to the steady-state oscillation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the applicability of certain results to the explanation of observed phenomena beyond the stall. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} feedforward controller {{is designed}} for gust loads alleviation and limit cycle oscillations suppression. Two sets of basis functions, based on the finite impulse response and modified finite impulse response approaches, are investigated to design the controller for gust loads alleviation. Limit cycle oscillations suppression is shown by using the modified finite impulse response controller. Worst <b>case</b> <b>gust</b> search is performed by using a nonlinear technique of model reduction {{to speed up the}} costs of calculations. Both the “one–minus–cosine” and Von Kármán continuous turbulence gusts of different intensities were generated to examine the performance of controllers. The responses of these two types of gust can be reduced effectively by finite impulse response controller in the whole process, while the modified finite impulse response controller is found to increase the loads during the initial transient response. The above two types of gust induced limit cycle oscillations were used to test the modified finite impulse response controller. Results show that it can suppress limit cycle oscillations to some exten...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the application of}} a parametric design process for the flying wing configuration MULDICON. The Multi-Disciplinary-Configuration (MULDICON) is a generic unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) developed for research purposes, a further development of the DLR-F 19 configuration, which was used for research activities in the scope of the DLR project Mephisto and its predecessors FaUSST and UCAV 2010. For the MULDICON, the DLR parametric design process MONA is applied. Special emphasis is placed on the structural modeling with composite material where each layer is modeled and analyzed. Various failure criteria are compared to define suitable constraints for the optimization of the load carrying structure. In contrast to optimize the thickness of composites with global allowable strains, such strategy allows for a detailed analysis of every layer. The number of constraints due to the set-up of every ply is substantially increased compared to the strain allowables but the structural optimization is still applicable. The detailed structural and mass models represent the global stiffness and structural dynamic characteristics of the aircraft. For the loads analysis part of the design process, 9 different mass configurations with a total of 306 maneuvering load cases as well as 336 1 -cos <b>gust</b> load <b>cases</b> are taken into account. Furthermore, a new simplified landing impact simulation is introduced to consider 12 landing load cases. All load cases are defined according to regulations like CS- 25. Such number of load cases is necessary to cover a sufficient number of flight conditions. For the selection of the design loads for the structural optimization the essential loads are analyzed for a subset of locations. Together with a parametrized optimization model, the structural optimization is conducted. The result is a weight optimized structural model for the MULDICON. This entire model allows for the investigation of physics based effects already at an early stage of the design process...|$|R

The method is simple to implement while still capturing important effects for early design estimates. Static aeroelastic loads, aeroelastic divergence and aileron reversal criteria are calculated directly with small matrices suitable for implementation in spreadsheet software. Maneuver, <b>gust</b> and ground <b>cases</b> are considered. A direct non-iterative method {{is used for the}} strut and wing internal loads calculation. The wing and strut load-carrying structures are sized with analytical box-beam equations for strength, buckling and fatigue criteria. Aluminum or composite laminates can be considered.

The aeroelastic effects and strut reaction estimations are compared {{for a wide range of}} design parameters with Nastran validating the proposed method. The weight estimations are verified with conventional aircraft data and strut-braced wing studies available in the literature, showing good accuracy.

40|$|Including a gust {{analysis}} in an optimization framework is computationally inefficient as the critical load cases {{are not known}} a priori and hence {{a large number of}} points within the flight envelope have to be analyzed. Model order reduction techniques can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency of an aeroelastic analysis. In this paper a reduced order aeroelastic model is formulated by reducing the aerodynamic system with a balanced proper orthogonal decomposition and coupling it to a structural solver. It is demonstrated that the dominant modes of the aerodynamic model can be assumed to be constant for varying equivalent airspeed and Mach number, enabling the use of a single reduced model for the entire flight envelope. Comparison of the results from the full and reduced order aeroelastic model shows a high accuracy of the latter and a large saving in computational cost. A dynamic aeroelastic optimization framework is then formulated using the reduced order aeroelastic model. Results show that both dynamic and static loads play a role in optimization of the wing structure. Furthermore, the worst <b>case</b> <b>gust</b> loads change during the optimization process and hence it is important to identify the critical loads at every iteration in the optimization.

The objectives of the test are to demonstrate the structural integrity of the joint and to measure percentage load acting on the bolt when the joint is subjected to external load corresponding to the critical load case. The T-bolt connection is chosen for blade root joint for its simplicity compared to other joints and its effectiveness to improve fatigue life of the bolt. A design preload of 120 kN and an external load of 88 kN corresponding to class III <b>gust</b> wind load <b>case,</b> as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), were considered to test the joint.

After each of the T-bolts is preloaded to 120 kN, a total load of 264 kN (for 3 bolts) is applied on the simulated blade root-hub joint using a Universal Testing Machine. The maximum strain recorded in the T-bolt and composite laminate after preload were 2370 and 1721 µs respectively.
