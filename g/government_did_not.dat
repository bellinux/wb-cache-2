5|$|When {{appealing}} the District Court's decision, the <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{argue that}} there was reasonable suspicion. Instead, the government argued that the border search doctrine supported both the initial search and the transportation of the laptop to Tucson for examination.|$|E
5|$|A bill providing, {{directly}} or indirectly, for the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or {{the raising of}} any loan by the Government if, {{in the opinion of}} the President, the bill is likely to draw on reserves of the Government that the <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> accumulate in its current term of office.|$|E
50|$|The <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{designate}} religion on passports {{or national}} identity documents, {{with the exception}} of birth certificates. On birth certificates issued to Muslims, the <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> differentiate between Sunnis and Shia.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{recognize}} the Druze or Baha'i Faiths as religions but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> prohibit their practice. The Druze <b>do</b> <b>not</b> face official discrimination {{nor do they}} complain of social discrimination. Baha'is face both official and social discrimination. The Baha'i community <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have its own court to adjudicate personal status matters, such as inheritance and other family-related issues; such cases may be heard in Shari'a courts. Baha'i spouses face difficulty in obtaining residency permits for their non-Jordanian partners because the <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recognize Baha'i marriage certificates. The <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> officially {{recognize the}} Druze temple in Azraq, and four social halls belonging to the Druze are registered as [...] "societies."

5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to enact this type of social legislation {{in the face of an}} election.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, but the <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> use {{this opportunity to}} increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and the <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E

50|$|In a {{capitalist}} system, the <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please. The <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> prevent firms from determining what wages {{they will pay}} and what prices they will charge for their products. Many countries, however, have minimum wage laws and minimum safety standards.|$|R
5|$|In November 2008, the New Scientist {{reported}} {{in an article}} that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by Faroese government that the consumption of Pilot Whale meat in the Faroes should stop {{as it had been}} proved to be too toxic. However, the Faroese <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> forbid people to eat Pilot Whale meat due to the contamination, but the advice from the Joensen and Weihe had an effect, it has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The <b>Government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone had hit, the Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets.

5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier. The tariff revisions {{of the past four}} years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position. Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new Populist Party candidate, James Weaver, who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well, although the federal <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take action.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operated}} 24 McDonnell Douglas F-4E PhantomII fighter-bomber {{aircraft in}} the ground attack role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays {{in the delivery of}} the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, but the <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{raise the}} Homeland Security Advisory System {{terrorist}} threat level, orange {{at the time}} (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack.

The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E

However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously– {{on the night}} of August 27 to 28. The Lithuanian intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did not know who and when. The Lithuanian government was informed about the cut telegraph wires and intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, the <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.|$|E

5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, {{with the passage of}} the Seat of Government Act 1904, it appeared that the matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
