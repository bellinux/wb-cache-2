5000|$|Jet was subLogic's second best-selling Commodore 64 game {{as of late}} 1987. Compute! favorably {{reviewed}} the Apple II version of Jet and its excellent graphics, but criticized the slow performance, reporting that it was [...] "painfully slow" [...] at updating the <b>display.</b> <b>Computer</b> Gaming World called Jet [...] "more of a 'game'" [...] than F/A-18 Interceptor, which the magazine described as [...] "a 'toy' ... you play a game, you play with a toy". The reviewer recommended both.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all {{television}} <b>displays</b> and <b>computer</b> <b>displays</b> form images {{by varying}} {{the strength of}} just three primary colors: red, green, and blue.

50|$|Termcap (terminal capability) is a {{software}} library and database used on Unix-like computers. It enables programs to use <b>display</b> <b>computer</b> terminals in a device-independent manner, which greatly simplifies {{the process of}} writing portable text mode applications. Bill Joy wrote the first termcap library in 1978 for the Berkeley Unix operating system; it has since been ported to most Unix and Unix-like environments. Joys design was reportedly influenced by the design of the terminal data store in the earlier Incompatible Timesharing System.|$|E
50|$|Another audio/video {{interface}} is DisplayPort, version 1.0, {{which was}} approved in May 2006. Several models of <b>display,</b> <b>computer,</b> and video cards have DisplayPort ports. The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort {{is expected to}} complement HDMI. Most of the companies producing equipment that uses DisplayPort are in the computer sector. DisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream.|$|E
50|$|The format {{had only}} one application: To publish {{documentary}} video, children's writings, and other historical records compiled from 1984 to 1986 for the BBC Domesday Project. The Domesday Project LV-ROM discs were played using a BBC Master computer connected via SCSI-1 to a Philips AIV VP415 Laserdisc player. A genlock enabled the software stored on the LV-ROM to <b>display</b> <b>computer</b> graphics over the analog video on the BBC Master's computer screen. The buttons and menus of the user interface were accessed with a trackball.|$|E
50|$|The EFIS {{visual display}} is {{produced}} by the symbol generator. This receives data inputs from the pilot, signals from sensors, and EFIS format selections made by the pilot.

[...] It {{has been used}} {{since at least the}} late 19th century, was {{utilized}} by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability, and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to <b>display</b> <b>computer</b> fonts. An example in another language is , containing all letters used in German, including every umlaut (ä, ö, ü) plus the ß. It has been used since before 1800.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} system, for example from camera through JPEG file to display, {{the role of}} gamma {{correction}} will involve several cooperating parts. The camera encodes its rendered image into the JPEG file {{using one of the}} standard gamma values such as 2.2, for storage and transmission. The <b>display</b> <b>computer</b> may use a color management engine to convert to a different color space (such as older Macintosh's γ = 1.8 color space) before putting pixel values into its video memory. The monitor may do its own gamma correction to match the CRT gamma to that used by the video system. Coordinating the components via standard interfaces with default standard gamma values makes it possible to get such system properly configured.|$|E
50|$|PCC also {{fostered the}} {{activities}} of its child organization, ComputerTown USA! That formalized PCC's long-standing activism around general computer literacy. At {{a time when many}} computers still were kept in clean rooms, PCC was taking them to libraries, grade schools and elder communities. Their activities encouraged hands-on exploration and just trying things. The Logo programming language and turtle graphics gave some users their first experience of controlling something on a computer <b>display.</b> <b>Computer</b> phobia was commonly perceived by PCC staff as a barrier to learning in a significant number of users, even in a large majority of some populations during those early years. Apple Computer's Community Affairs department used ComputerTown USA! to develop curriculum and to conduct intensive trainings for the non-profit recipients of computer hardware and software grants from Apple.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>displays</b> with aspect ratios {{wider than}} 4:3 are also called widescreen.

40|$|A novel text input {{for public}} <b>displays</b> and palmtop <b>computers</b> is {{presented}} {{that separates the}} input from the display of the edited text. While the public display shows both the edited text and a character generation interface, palmtop computers are used for input in a blind way, i. e. without the {{need to look at}} the palmtop's small screen. This allows for an effective text input with multiple users interacting simultaneously on the public display. Advanced features such as a dictionary-based word completion can run directly on the public <b>display's</b> <b>computer</b> instead of the palmtop with its limited resources. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>displays</b> with {{aspect ratio}} wider than 4:3 are also called widescreen. Widescreen <b>computer</b> <b>displays</b> are {{typically}} of the 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio.
