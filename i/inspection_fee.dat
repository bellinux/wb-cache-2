2500|$|Since its founding, the EU has {{operated}} among an increasing plurality {{of national and}} globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, {{and in any case}} under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states [...] "have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves" [...] on the [...] "basis of reciprocity". EU law would not [...] "be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question". This meant any [...] "subsequent unilateral act" [...] of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health <b>inspection</b> <b>fee</b> under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In [...] "accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law", said the Court of Justice, the [...] "directly applicable measures of the institutions" [...] (such as the Regulations in the case) [...] "render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law". This was necessary to prevent a [...] "corresponding denial" [...] of Treaty [...] "obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states", that could [...] "imperil the very foundations of the" [...] EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if bidders have {{independent}} private values and homogeneous entry costs a …rst- or second-price auction with a reserve price equal to the seller’s value maximizes social surplus and seller revenue, and leaves bidders with no surplus.

We show that when entry costs are heterogeneous (and private information) the revenue maximizing reserve price is above the seller’s value, a positive <b>inspection</b> <b>fee</b> (and a reserve price equal to the seller’s value) generates even more revenue, and in either case bidders capture informational rents. Further, seller revenue and social surplus may either increase or decrease with the number of bidders.

Our results are framed in terms of screening values rather than reserve prices, and apply to any standard auction...|$|E
40|$|In this article, I {{address the}} {{persistent}} confusion over {{the meaning of}} a medical diagnosis of drug addiction or substance dependence in the courtroom, specifically in regard to legal judgments about the reasonable legal person, causation, and individual responsibility in civil actions. Using the example of the Engle tobacco litigation in Florida, where the plaintiffs have reduced mind to brain and claimed that the clinical status of addiction excuses or mitigates the smoker’s responsibility for the health consequences of smoking based on brain processes, I examine the conceptual difficulties presented by use of biomedical models of behavior in a legal system predicated on different assumptions altogether. For legal purposes, the biological system in question is the human organism as a whole, not a brain per se, and there is a functional identity between a smoker and his motivational states for purposes of responsibility attribution.

Although the rules of this two-stage inspection procedure demands that each eel from every pond is inspected before export (second stage), agencies may not have all eels from every pond inspected to save on <b>inspection</b> <b>fees.</b> If an eel is found to contain drug residues, {{it is difficult to}} confirm the farm where it was produced because of the possibility of agencies or dealers having mixed all the eels together. Another worrying aspect is that Taiwan exports about 20, 000 tons of eel to Japan annually; if every batch weighs about 2 tons, this equates roughly to 10, 000 batches requiring inspection, and as every batch needs to be inspected twice, 20, 000 inspections are needed. Assuming 200 working days per year, 100 batches require inspection every day. At present, sampling is done by the Eel Farmers’ Association, and this places a large burden on that body.
