50|$|A {{third-party}} fix for the 1541 appeared {{where the}} solid <b>head</b> <b>stop</b> {{was replaced by}} a sprung stop, giving the head a much easier life. The later 1571 drive (which is 1541-compatible) incorporates track-zero detection by photo-interrupter and is thus immune to the problem. Also, a software solution, which resides in the drive controller's ROM, prevents the rereads from occurring, though this could cause problems when genuine errors did occur.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high position lights and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper <b>head</b> <b>Stop</b> and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR position lights to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads. Internally referred to as position color lights, these are {{not to be confused with}} color position lights described below, which while functionally similar are structurally considerably different.|$|E

5000|$|The {{repertoire}} consisted {{mostly of}} cover songs including Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Roxy Music and Television. These songs were performed in Swedish in humorous translations, such as Iggy Pop's [...] "I'm bored, I'm {{the chairman of}} the bored" [...] became [...] "I am weary, I stand {{at the end of every}} level" [...] and Television's [...] "Elevation, do not go to my <b>head,</b> <b>Stop</b> the elevator and my skull is flat." [...] Per Eriksson designed stickers with the band's name and distributed them to friends who were on a trip. The result was that Lolita Pop's name could be seen in Stockholm, Hamburg, Paris, New York, New Delhi and Beijing long before the band played outside their club. Per Eriksson also designed most of the band’s album covers.|$|E
5000|$|The Commodore 64 had an {{optional}} external 5-1/4" [...] floppy drive. The Commodore 1541 contained a 6502 microprocessor {{which was used}} to run Commodore DOS and also to manage the drive mechanism. The drives stored data on 40 tracks (#0-39), and the stepper motor could be manually controlled through BASIC by PRINT#-ing [...] "MEMORY-WRITE" [...] commands to the drive (which correspond to the POKE command of BASIC, but write to the drive's internal memory and I/O registers, not those of the computer itself). If the drive was {{at either end of}} its range (track 0 or track 39) and it was commanded to continue moving, there was no software or firmware method to prevent drive damage. Continued [...] "knocking" [...] of the drive head against the stop would throw the mechanism out of alignment. The problem was exacerbated by copy protection techniques that used non-standard disk formats with unusual track counts. The Commodore 1571 had an optical <b>head</b> <b>stop</b> instead of a mechanical one.|$|E
50|$|Zak locks Belle in a barn to {{give her}} a taste of what prison would be like, and refuses to give Lisa the key to let her out. Belle {{believes}} that if she gets pregnant by Sean, she will avoid going to prison. But they later drop the idea. Belle's brother, Sam Dingle (James Hooton), tries to run away with her to escape a prison sentence, but Dom tips off the police and Belle is remanded. During the trial, Belle is sentenced to three years in prison, but she is forgiven by Dom. Belle later wins an appeal and her sentence is reduced to one year. When Belle is released from prison, she finds it hard to adjust to normal life again. She becomes erratic, dyes her hair dark and befriends Lachlan White. Belle is later discovered by Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) and Harriet Finch in the church, crying and covered in blood. Belle refuses to tell Zak and Lisa who attacked her. Belle considers trying to kill herself with painkillers, but she fails and breaks down in tears. Belle trashes David Metcalfe's (Matthew Wolfenden) shop and Edna Birch's (Shirley Stelfox) house. It soon emerges Belle is suffering from a mental health crisis, as she believes she can see and talk to Gemma. Lachlan offers Belle a legal high pill, which she takes and is relieved to discover that the voices in her <b>head</b> <b>stop.</b> Belle asks Lachlan for more of the pills, which he gives to her.|$|E

40|$|Greater {{levels of}} {{complexity}} in tunnelling with Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) allow higher chances of failures that {{may increase the}} potential hazardous risks. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on TBM reliability using risk analysis. Machinery Failure Mode and Effect analysis was applied to analyze the risks of a TBM using QS 9000 and SAE. J 1739 recommendations. For this purpose, 48 failure modes were postulated for the TBM main systems and all subsystems. Afterwards, the effects of every failure were listed. Safeguards or controls that might prevent or mitigate the effects of each failure were also listed. In the final step, essential remedial actions to prevent or mitigate the failure were recommended. Risk Matrix was developed for each possible failure to be used for risk ranking. For this, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) was estimated for each failure mode for pro and post application of control measures to identify the most critical failures. The results revealed that 7 failure modes had risk priority numbers higher than 80 therefore, they were categorized unacceptable. Cutter <b>head</b> <b>stop</b> due to bad rock condition with RPN= 240 was the significant critical failure. The results also showed that 3 failure modes in TBM required modification due to high Severity rate. The findings from this study were applied to a long tunnel under construction and significantly reduced the accidents during the next two years tunnelling period. It can be concluded that MFMEA is a superb tool for TBM reliability evaluation and promotion...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} types of line <b>stopping</b> <b>heads.</b> The oldest and still most widely used method of line {{plugging}} is the pivoting <b>head</b> style line <b>stop.</b> This technology {{dates back to the}} 1930s. The pivot <b>head</b> line <b>stop</b> requires a full size on size hot tap in order to be inserted into the operating piping system. Other methods include the folding <b>head</b> line <b>stop</b> which enters the pipe through a reduced branch hot tap, the Sure-Stop line stop which intersects the pipe and doesn't seal inside the pipe like other methods, and the HTP which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of line stops can safely stop.|$|R

25|$|Before a disk can be accessed, {{the drive}} needs to {{synchronize}} its head {{position with the}} disk tracks. In some drives, this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface. In either case, the head is moved {{so that it is}} approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the <b>head</b> <b>stops</b> moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.|$|R
