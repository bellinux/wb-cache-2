Rindt was not wearing <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> properly, either - in addition to the belts being loose, a crotch strap part of the <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> had been introduced recently, and Rindt wasn't wearing one.

Listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center were Thomas Lee Pickard, 24, the driver, and Charles E. Rutherford Jr., 32, both of 2211 Belleview Ter. Hospital officials said Pickard was suffering from possible internal injuries and possible fractured hip or leg. Rutherford, a passenger who was thrown from the vehicle, was suffering from multiple lacerations and fractures, hospital officials reported. Both men were undergoing further examination late this morning. Officer C. S. Nelson said Pickard was apparently driving the late model Jeep as he attempted to change lanes about 9 : 50 a. m. Witnesses said the northbound towed auto began whipping {{back and forth as}} Pickard's Jeep completed the lane change. As the rear end of the Jeep started swaying, Pickard apparently lost control and his vehicle hit a curb and flipped on its side before smashing into a traffic sign and rolling over on its top, Nelson said.

He returned to the track but lost seven seconds worth of time. He made his pit stop on the same lap and emerged in second, 7.4 seconds behind teammate Rosberg. Button closed up to Kvyat and feigned a passing move on the latter but waited until the main straight to overtake Kvyat with DRS assistance heading into the Senna chicane on lap 30.

As there was little information available to explain the difference in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rates, the main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate why there is a lower rate of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads. A number of perceptions, beliefs and expectancies about <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined to identify variables that discriminated between <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> users and non-users on urban roads. The subjects were 398 undergraduate students (aged 17 - 47) studying at the University of Girona, Spain. On the urban roads reported discomfort from using the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was higher, while perceptions of risk (for non-users), safety perceptions (for those using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt),</b> beliefs about the seriousness of a crash or the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> were all lower than on the highway. Perceptions of safety, discomfort, and social influence predicted <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads. Concern about being lined for not using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> did not predict <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. The results of this research suggest that in order to increase <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads, the issue of discomfort must be addressed. In addition, prevention campaigns should include information about the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in preventing/reducing injuries or deaths on urban roads.

At 50 %, the effect of child protection devices is even slightly higher. When last measured (in 2010), 97 % of the front seat occupants in cars used a <b>seat</b> <b>belt,</b> and so did approximately 82 % of backseat occupants.

Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> buckled, died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide strikes me as an odd way for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|E

40|$|Background: In Trinidad and Tobago, {{the law on}} the {{mandatory}} use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> was passed in 1995, but this law is hardly enforced. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the frequency and predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by motor vehicle drivers in the country. Findings: A cross-sectional study of 959 motor vehicle drivers using a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis included Pearson Chi square test and multinomial logistic regression analysis in order to determine the possible predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by the drivers in Trinidad and Tobago. A majority of the drivers sometimes (51. 8 %) or always (31. 6 %) use a <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> About 16. 7 %, 29 % and 54. 2 % of the drivers perceived that the other drivers use their <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> more frequently, with the same frequency and less frequently respectively compared to themselves. The main reason for not using <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> by the drivers was given as frequent stops (40. 7 %) and the main motivation to use <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> by the drivers was given as stiffer penalties for non-compliance with the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law (44. 5 %). The predictors of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were male driver, no formal or lower level of education, driving for less than 10 years, and the perception that the other drivers use <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> with the same or higher frequency compared to the respondents. Conclusion: Only a small proportion of the drivers in Trinidad and Tobago always use a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> when driving.
