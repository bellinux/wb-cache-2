5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of urban planning, Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, {{there were only a few}} modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> happen. The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E

5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E
