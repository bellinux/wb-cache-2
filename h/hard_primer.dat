5000|$|While early (1949-50) Soviet models had {{spring-loaded}} firing pins, {{which held}} the pin away from cartridge primers until {{struck by the}} action's hammer, most variants of the SKS have a free floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, {{care must be taken}} during cleaning (especially after long storage packed in Cosmoline) to ensure that the firing pin can freely move and does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental [...] "slamfires" [...] (the rifle firing on its own, without pulling the trigger and often without being fully locked). This behavior is less likely with the <b>hard</b> <b>primer</b> military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle, users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of Cosmoline embedded in it that retard firing pin movement. As it is triangular in cross section with only one way to properly insert it (notches up), slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted in one of the other two orientations.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing {{the obvious}} need to {{minimize}} the chance of slamfires, there are two simple methods commonly employed. One is to use ammunition with <b>harder</b> <b>primers,</b> which require a more significant strike from the firing pin and are thus unlikely to go off with a comparatively light inertial strike. Most military ammunition makes use of <b>hard</b> <b>primers</b> for this reason. The second method of minimizing the risk of slamfire is {{in the design of}} the firearm itself. Spring-loaded firing pins prevent slamfires because the pin cannot easily move inside the bolt. A proper strike from the firearm's hammer will overcome the resistance of the spring, but ordinary inertia will not. A simple solution in free-floating pin designs is to make the firing pin itself very lightweight, which reduces its inertia and lessens the risk of slamfire.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} many subtle issues {{involving}} the provenance of a rifle and its ammunition. Many calibres have dual civilian/military uses but are not completely identical - e.g. the [...]308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO and [...]223 Remington/5.56mm NATO have very slight differences in chamber sizes. Military ammunition often has thicker brass, and <b>harder</b> <b>primers.</b> Over major wars there were literally millions of surplus rifles converted to civilian uses (sporterized); many may be unsafe with modern ammunition - caution is required with any ex-military bolt action.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{also has}} a {{cartridge}} casing extractor, while the ejector is located inside the trigger housing (the ejector is lifted by a spring {{in the front of}} the trigger housing. The recoiling bolt carrier pushes the rear of the ejector down insuring the ejector is lifted into place to insure ejection is timed properly). The weapon is hammer-fired and has a fire control lever, which is also the manual safety. The safety and fire selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip, and has three settings: [...] "S" [...] (Spanish: Seguro)—weapon safe (trigger is disabled mechanically), [...] "T" [...] (Spanish: Tiro a tiro)—semi-automatic fire and [...] "R" [...] (Spanish: Ráfaga)—fully automatic fire (initial production rifles also had a burst selector option, which was abandoned). The Model L fires from a closed bolt position and uses the NATO-standard 5.56×45mm cartridge loaded with the 62-grain SS109 projectile. INI (Instituto Nacional de Industria, a state factory) made ammunition was dirtier and gave much more chamber pressure than standard NATO ammunition, and was one of the sources of reliability problems (<b>hard</b> <b>primers</b> were in part responsible, too). At NATO joint exercises, foreign units tended to be warned not to use Spanish ammo if their rifles were gas operated needed.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 FN Herstal {{recalled}} the FS2000 semi-automatic carbine {{that had been}} inadvertently assembled with the firing pin of the FN F2000 military carbine. The military firing pin was a heavier design, used to achieve complete ignition reliability with the <b>harder</b> or denser <b>primers</b> generally used in military-specification ammunition. The use of this military firing pin reportedly caused slam-fires in the FN FS2000 when firing with certain types of commercial ammunition available in the United States.|$|R
