However, a higher concentration of 10B in the tumor will result in it receiving a higher total dose than that of adjacent normal tissues, which is the basis for the therapeutic gain in BNCT. The total radiation dose in Gy delivered to any tissue can be expressed in photon-equivalent units as the sum of each of the high LET dose components multiplied by weighting factors (Gyw), which depend on the increased radiobiological effectiveness of each of these components.|$|E
50|$|BNCT of {{patients}} with brain tumors was resumed in the United States in the mid-1990s by Chanana, Diaz, and Coderre and their co-workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) and at Harvard/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) using the MIT Research Reactor (MITR). For the first time, BPA {{was used as the}} boron delivery agent, and patients were irradiated with a collimated beam of higher energy epithermal neutrons, which had greater tissue-penetrating properties than thermal neutrons. A research group headed up by Zamenhof at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and MIT was the first to use an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> for clinical trials. Initially patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated and this was expanded to include patients with brain tumors, specifically melanoma metastatic to the brain and primary glioblastomas (GBMs). Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the capture agent. The clinical outcome of the cases treated at Harvard-MIT has been summarized by Busse. Although the treatment was well tolerated, {{there were no significant differences}} in the mean survival times {{of patients}} that had received BNCT compared to those who received conventional external beam X-irradiation.|$|E

50|$|Biological {{weighting}} {{factors have been}} used in all of the recent clinical trials in patients with high grade gliomas, using boronophenylalanine (BPA) in combination with an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam.</b> The 10B(n,α)7Li component of the radiation dose to the scalp has been based on the measured boron concentration in the blood at the time of BNCT, assuming a blood: scalp boron concentration ratio of 1.5:1 and a compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor for BPA in skin of 2.5. A relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factor of 3.2 has been used in all tissues for the high LET components of the beam, such as alpha particles. The RBE factor is used to compare the biologic effectiveness of different types of ionizing radiation. The high LET components include protons resulting from the capture reaction with normal tissue nitrogen, and recoil protons resulting from the collision of fast neutrons with hydrogen. It must be emphasized that the tissue distribution of the boron delivery agent in humans should be similar to that in the experimental animal model in order to use the experimentally derived values for estimation of the radiation doses for clinical radiations. For more detailed information relating to computational dosimetry and treatment planning, interested readers are referred to a comprehensive review on this subject.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, to {{conclude}} this section, {{the following is}} a brief summary of a clinical trial that was carried out by Stenstam, Sköld, Capala and their co-workers in Sweden using BPA and an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> at the Studsvik nuclear reactor, which had greater tissue penetration properties than the thermal beams originally used in Japan. This study differed significantly from all previous clinical trials in that the total amount of BPA administered was increased (900 mg/kg), and it was infused i.v. over 6 hours. This was based on experimental animal studies in glioma bearing rats demonstrating enhanced uptake of BPA by infiltrating tumor cells following a 6-hour infusion. The longer infusion time of the BPA was well tolerated by the 30 patients who were enrolled in this study. All were treated with 2 fields, and the average whole brain dose was 3.2-6.1 Gy (weighted), and the minimum dose to the tumor ranged from 15.4 to 54.3 Gy (w). There has been some disagreement among the Swedish investigators regarding the evaluation of the results. Based on incomplete survival data, the MeST was reported as 14.2 months and the time to tumor progression was 5.8 months. However, more careful examination [...] of the complete survival data revealed that the MeST was 17.7 months compared to 15.5 months that has been reported for patients who received standard therapy of surgery, followed by radiotherapy (RT) and the drug temozolomide (TMZ). Furthermore, the frequency of adverse events was lower after BNCT (14%) than after radiation therapy (RT) alone (21%) and both of these were lower than those seen following RT in combination with TMZ. If this improved survival data, obtained using the higher dose of BPA and a 6-hour infusion time, can be confirmed by others, preferably in a randomized clinical trial, it could represent a significant step forward in BNCT of brain tumors, especially if combined with a photon boost.|$|E

A suitable <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> for BNCT must have minimal fast neutron and gamma radiation contamination, and yet retain an appreciable intensity.

Various accelerator-based approaches will be reviewed, but discussion will concentrate on the Birmingham programme, particularly the design of a suitable neutron beam delivery system and the experimental validation of Monte Carlo simulations on a mock-up neutron beam moderation system. The use of dose modifying factors to evaluate the likely clinical utility of an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> will also be discussed, with illustrations from th...|$|E
40|$|Dosimetry {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out at the <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> of LVR- 15 reactor (Řež) moderated by a polyethylene disk placed through the collimator exit. The spatial distributions of thermal neutron fluence rate and of gamma and fast neutron dose rates have been attained. The contributions to the dose of the radiation field components have been assessed with Fricke-gel-layers, by pixel-to-pixel elaboration of the light transmittance images of samples having different isotopic composition and with thermoluminescence detectors, by analysing the shape of the glow curve. An analogous experiment has been carried out at the thermal column HK 1 of the same LVR- 15 reactor, aimed at neutronography research. Good consistency of all results was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of Fricke gel dosimeters {{in form of}} layers for measurements aimed at the characterization of <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beams</b> has been studied. By means of dosimeters of different isotopic composition (standard, containing 10 B or prepared with heavy water) placed against the collimator exit, the spatial distribution of gamma and fast neutron doses and of thermal neutron fluence are attained. In order to investigate {{the accuracy of the}} results obtained with in-air measurements, suitable MC simulations have been developed and experimental measurements have been performed utilizing Fricke gel dosimeters, thermoluminescence detectors and activation foils. The studies were related to the epithermal beam designed for BNCT irradiations at the research reactor LVR- 15 (Řež). The results of calculation and measurements have revealed good consistency of gamma dose and fast neutron 2 D distributions obtained with gel dosimeters in form of layers. In contrast, noticeable modification of thermal neutron fluence is caused by the neutron moderation produced by the dosimeter material. Fricke gel dosimeters in thin cylinders, with diameter not greater than 3 mm, have proved to give good results for thermal neutron profiling. For greater accuracy of all results, a better knowledge of the dependence of gel dosimeter sensitivity on radiation LET is needed...|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of boron {{delivery}} agents have been synthesized, but only two of these currently are being used in clinical trials. The first, which has been used primarily in Japan, is a polyhedral borane anion, sodium borocaptate or BSH (Na2B12H11SH), {{and the second is}} a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, referred to as boronophenylalanine or BPA. The latter has been used in clinical trials in the United States, Finland, Japan and more recently, Argentina and Taiwan. Following administration of either BPA or BSH by intravenous infusion, the tumor site is irradiated with neutrons, the source of which up until now has been specially designed nuclear reactors. Until 1994, low-energy (< 0.5 eV) thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>beams</b> were used in Japan and the United States, but since they have a limited depth of penetration in tissues, higher energy (>.5eV<10 keV) <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beams,</b> which have a greater depth of penetration, have been used in clinical trials in the United States, Europe, Japan, Argentina, Taiwan, and China. In theory BNCT is a highly selective type of radiation therapy that can target tumor cells without causing radiation damage to the adjacent normal cells and tissues. Doses up to 60-70 grays can be delivered to the tumor cells in one or two applications compared to 6-7 weeks for conventional fractionated external beam photon irradiation. However, the effectiveness of BNCT is dependent upon a relatively homogeneous cellular distribution of 10B within the tumor, and this {{is still one of the}} main unsolved problems that have limited its success.|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la: "International Conference on Nuclear Data for Science and Technology" celebrada en New York (US) del 4 al 8 {{de marzo de}} 2013. [...] et al. and the n TOF Collaboration. The 33 S(n,α) {{cross section}} is of {{interest}} in medical physics since it has been proposed as a possible/alternative cooperating target to boron neutron capture therapy due to the remarkable feature of the 33 S(n,α) reaction channel at <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> energies: alpha particle energy above 3 MeV in absence of gamma emission. The scarce experimental data which are available at present show that, in principle, the lowest-lying and strongest resonance occurs at neutron energy of 13. 5 keV. <b>Epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>beams</b> of around 10 keV are considered the optimal ones for neutron capture therapy. According to the available data, the resonance peak at that energy {{is larger than the}} hydrogen elastic scattering cross section, the dominant mechanism of <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> interactions in tissue. Nevertheless, the set of resonance parameters which determine the 33 S(n,α) cross section at these energies present important discrepancies (more than a factor two) between different measurements and they are not described by the most popular evaluated data bases such as ENDF or JENDL. The present work aims to contribute in this aspect which is evinced by Monte Carlo simulations that, even based on the most conservative values of the lowest resonances, have shown a noticeable local increase of the dose at the isotope site with a <b>neutron</b> <b>beam</b> of 13. 5 keV. Preliminary tests of the measurement of the 33 S(n,α) reaction were successfully performed at n TOF-CERN during 2011. In particular, the first low-lying resonance was measured (with low statistics) using a micromegastype detector and with the 10 B(n,α) cross section as a standard. The results of this test will be shown. The kerma-fluence factors corresponding to 10 B, 33 S and those of a standard four-component ICRU tissue have been calculated for using them is Monte Carlo simulations of the dose deposited on tissue. The comparison between different evaluated data and experimental data will be shown. Following its approval by the ISOLDE and Neutron Time-Of-Flight (INTC) committee at CERN, the measurement of 33 S(n,α) reaction cross section will be performed at n TOF-CERN in October-November 2012. The results of a preliminary data analysis will be shown, too. Peer reviewe...|$|R
