40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system for modelling and digital fabrication of discrete and functionally graded multi-material objects for biomedical applications. The MMVP system {{consists of a}} DMMVP module, an FGMVP module, and a virtual reality (VR) simulation module. The DMMVP module is used for design and process planning of discrete multi-material (DMM) objects, while the FGMVP module is for functionally graded multimaterial (FGM) objects. The VR simulation module integrates these two modules to perform digital fabrication of multimaterial objects, which can be subsequently visualized and analyzed in a virtual environment to optimize MMLM processes for fabrication of product prototypes. Using the MMVP system, two biomedical objects, including a human dextrocardic heart made of discrete multi-materials and a <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> of FGM are modelled and digitally fabricated for visualization and analysis in a VR environment.

40|$|A major {{contributing}} factor to {{the onset of}} early hip osteoarthritis is attributed to an enlarged, aspherical femoral head deformity, characterized as cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The presence of the cam deformity alone does not explain differences in pathomechanisms {{and it has been}} theorized that adverse loading to the subchondral bone may play a predominant mechanical role in early joint degeneration. This doctoral thesis examined the adverse <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> loading due to cam FAI and characterize mechanical stimuli associated with symptoms. Specifically, this research: 1) examined anatomical and functional characteristics associated with the cam morphology; 2) developed subject-specific finite element <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> models to examine <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> stresses, incorporating subject-specific geometries, materials properties, and joint loading; and 3) implemented loading parameters during level walking and squatting to examine <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> stresses. First, a classification study was conducted to recruit three participant groups: 1) symptomatic (where participants had the cam deformity and pain); 2) asymptomatic (where participants had the cam deformity, but no pain); and 3) control (where participants did not have the cam deformity or clinical signs). Each participant's CT data were evaluated for multiple anatomical <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> parameters and then re-classified into their respective subgroups, using a discriminant function analysis, based on the most significant parameters. In addition to the cam deformity, symptomatic individuals had a lower femoral neck-shaft angle and reduced pelvic range of motion. Second, using the classified participants, <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> loading was determined for the various severities of cam FAI, with respect to alterations in hip contact forces and anatomical considerations. <b>Hip</b> <b>joint</b> <b>assemblies</b> were segmented and reconstructed from subject-specific CT and MRI data, where bone densities were quantified from CT data. A parametric study was conducted to understand how varying material properties and loading conditions affected the sensitivity of the predictive models, examining the most appropriate modelling parameters to capture relative measurements. Third, in conjunction with the first two studies, hip contact forces for level walking and squatting tasks were applied to corresponding subject-specific models and simulated. As a cross-sectional analysis, the stress magnitudes and regions described the joint loading in vivo for each subject group and ascertained the risk of remodeling. For each subgroup (symptomatic, asymptomatic, control), the participants with the largest and smallest femoral neck-shaft angles were selected and compared. The symptomatic model with the lowest femoral neck-shaft angle demonstrated the highest stress on the cartilage, during walking and squatting, and on the subchondral bone, during squatting. The asymptomatic models showed cartilage stresses similar to the control group, but experienced high-risk subchondral bone stresses, similar to the symptomatic group. For both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, the acetabular subchondral bone stresses coincided with known areas of bone adaptation and proteoglycan depletion. The outcome of this research program supported that cartilage degradation might not be due to direct contact shear stresses, but perhaps rather attributed to the indirect effects of a stiffer subchondral bone plate. Individuals with a large cam deformity and decreased femoral neck-shaft angles are likely to experience severe subchondral bone stresses during higher amplitudes of hip motion. This provides clinicians with indications of how the pathology exacerbates and where initial cartilage delamination will likely occur, allowing them to perform the correct assessments and proceed with the correct form of care. From a patient's perspective, an early and accurate diagnosis could inhibit cartilage degradation and the progression of osteoarthritis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Few {{researchers}} have discussed <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> dysplasia in adults affected bypoliomyelitis. We retrospectively studied {{the outcomes of}} <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> functionin poliomyelitic adults who underwent periacetabular osteotomy for the contralateralpainful non-paralytic dysplastic <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> Methods: Eight female patients with {{the mean age of}} 35. 9 years underwent periacetabularosteotomy from January 1991 through July 2002. The procedure wasperformed on eight non-paralytic <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> via a modified Olliertranstrochanteric approach. Harris <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> scores and radiographs were usedto evaluate the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> functions. Results: At a mean of 9. 0 3. 8 years postoperatively, the modified Harris hip jointscores had improved from 45. 6 12. 9 points preoperatively to 75. 8 20. 9 points. Radiographically, the degree of osteoarthrosis remained unchanged inseven <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> and got worse in one. The anterior center-edge (CE) angleincreased from 14. 0 17. 5 to 30. 9 10. 4 degrees. The lateral CE angleincreased from - 16. 0 11. 7 to 18. 0 23. 3 degrees. The acetabular indexangle improved from 26. 0 6. 9 to 11. 3 4. 4 degrees. The acetabular headindex increased from 36. 1 11. 7 to 63. 1 20. 7 %. With an outcome systemcombining modified Harris <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> scores and radiographic severity ofosteoarthrosis, six patients had satisfactory results. Coxa valga usuallyoccurred bilaterally with the neck-shaft angle of 159. 1 15. 7 degrees for theoperated non-paralytic <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> versus 161. 4 6. 7 degrees for the nonoperatedparalytic <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> Complications included osteonecrosis of therotated acetabular fragment, acetabulofemoral impingement, a defect on therotated ilium, and non-union of the superior pubic ramus (one <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> each).

40|$|Alterations in <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> loading {{have been}} {{associated}} with diseases such as arthritis and osteoporosis. Understanding the relationship between gait speed and <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> loading in healthy hips may illuminate changes in gait mechanics as walking speed deviates from preferred.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{define the}} centre of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> and the bone stock around the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> from the supra-acetabular portion or pelvic brim so as to avoid {{penetration}} of guidewire into the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> when performing internal fixation using the anterior approach. METHODS: A total of 42 cadavers were utilised. Measurements were completed before and after cutting the pelvis into 4 pieces. Before cutting the pelvis, {{the centre of}} the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> was measured on the pelvic brim. After cutting the pelvis, the bone stock around the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> was measured in each section. The pelvic brim and the anteroinferior iliac spine were utilised as guide points in the measurements, because these parameters could be determined during an anterior surgical procedure. RESULTS: On the pelvic brim, the reflected centre of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> centre was located approximately 3. 2 mm anterior to the distal edge of the anteroinferior iliac spine.

40|$|DissertationArchosaurs (crocodylians, {{birds and}} their extinct relatives) {{underwent}} numerous evolutionary transitions in limb morphology and body size, reflecting a diverse suite of postural and behavioral adaptations. Among archosaurs, saurischians (sauropodomorph and theropod dinosaurs) evolved a wide diversity of <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> morphology and locomotor postures, {{as well as}} spanning seven orders of magnitude in body size. The very largest saurischians possessed incongruent <b>hip</b> <b>joints,</b> in which the bony ends of the femur and the acetabulum (hip socket) differ in shape and size. This observation {{has led to the}} suggestion that gigantic saurischians built their joints using large volumes of soft tissues. Nevertheless, the lack of <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> anatomical data in extant archosaurs and the general poor preservation of joint soft tissues in fossils hinder functional inferences of archosaur <b>hip</b> <b>joints,</b> thus complicating our attempts to understand the posture, locomotor behavior, ecology, and evolution of this diverse clade. This thesis investigates the anatomy and homology of articular soft tissue in the archosaur <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> reconstructs the evolutionary transition of <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> in Saurischia, and infers the correlated evolution of <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> and body size in the sauropod and theropod lineages. In the first study, I described the soft tissue anatomies and their osteological correlates in the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> of archosaurs and their sauropsid outgroups, and infer structural homology across extant sauropsids using dissection, imaging, and histology. This study provides new insight into soft tissue structures and their osteological correlates in the archosaur <b>hip</b> <b>joint,</b> allowing anatomical inferences of once-present joint soft tissues in fossil archosaurs. In the second study, I used maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction and osteological correlates to infer major trends in <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> soft tissue transitions within sauropodomorphs and theropods, and tested the integration between femoral and acetabular structures. Results {{of this study indicate that}} sauropodomorph <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> underwent few concerted transitions, followed by subsequent stasis in soft tissue anatomy throughout Sauropoda. In contrast, the theropod <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> is characterized by mosaic evolution within the stem lineage, such that bird-like <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> independently evolved in multiple theropod clades. In the final study, I used 3 D imaging techniques and phylogenetically correlated correlations to test the relationship among <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> dimensions, morphological characters, and body size of saurischian dinosaurs. Giant theropods and sauropods convergently evolved highly incongruent bony <b>hip</b> <b>joints.</b> In sauropods, the femoral head was capped a thick layer of hyaline cartilage, which functioned to resist massive axial compressive loads. In contrast, theropods covered their femoral head and neck with thinner hyaline cartilage, and maintained the femoral neck-antitrochanter articulation to accommodate shear forces during femoral abduction and axial rotation. These results indicate that the archosaur <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> underwent divergent transformations in soft tissue morphology reflective of body size, locomotor posture, and joint loading. Moreover, these studies provides the basis for reconstructing <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> function, hindlimb posture, and locomotor evolution of archosaurs, as well as expanding the body of comparative knowledge on vertebrate joint and cartilage biology...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the support leg was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> force of the support leg was generated by its <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> flexion and adduction torque, the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> force of the recovery leg was generated by the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> flexion and adduction torque of the support leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> flexion torque exerted by the support leg rotated the pelvis backward. The <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> extension position.

Four {{of the five}} patients responded rapidly to intra-articular corticosteroids, {{and none of the}} five has had further <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> symptoms during a mean follow up period of two years. Key words: transient synovitis. <b>Hip</b> <b>joint</b> involvement in {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be defined clinically, but most published observations addressing the problem have focused on roentgenographic abnormalities; by this definition, <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> involvement has been recog-nised in 30 - 75 % of patients with RA. 1 - 7 Acute flares of articular synovitis are a well recognised phenomenon in RA, though an acute flare of limited distribution should raise the question of a superim-posed infectious process. 8 Flares in the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> in patients with RA could be assumed to occur as often as flares in other joints, but no previously published report has specifically addressed this issue. Because of the apparent rarity, unique clinical features, and dramatic presentation of this phenomenon we report our experience with five cases of acute <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> arthritis in patients with RA.

40|$|In 17 {{adult and}} 3 full term fetuses the <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> were {{dissected}} {{to expose the}} insertion of gluteus minimus. An attachment of the deep surface of the tendon as it passes over the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> capsule was found in every case. Histological examination of this insertion confirmed the presence of short intramuscular tendons firmly anchoring the tendon to the capsule. It is suggested that this attachment retracts the capsule during <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> motion, thereby preventing capsular entrapment...|$|R
30|$|The centre-edge (CE) {{angle of}} the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> was {{measured}} using an AP plain radiograph. AP plain radiographs of the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> were assessed {{for the presence of}} coxa profunda and protrusio acetabuli, and CE angle ≥ 40 °, which are indicators of a deep socket, a crossover sign known as an indicator of acetabular retroversion. The femoral α angle was measured; <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> with a femoral α angle ≥ 55 ° were defined as having cam deformity. Patients having <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> with a deep socket, acetabular retroversion or femoral cam deformity, or both, were defined as having femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) (Tannast and Siebenrock 2009). OA grade was assessed radiographically according to the Tönnis classification system (Tonnis 1987).|$|R
40|$|AbstractTotal knee {{arthroplasty}} and {{hip replacement}} {{are commonly used}} procedures in which an ailing knee or <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> is replaced with a carefully engineered artificial joint. Multibody models of healthy knee and <b>hip</b> <b>joints</b> are used extensively to design artificial knee and joints. The quality of the replacement joint is thus intrinsically related {{to the quality of}} the multibody models. In this work, the quality of a kinematic knee model is assessed by comparing predicted knee kinematics to cadaveric knee kinematics under several patellar overstuffing conditions. In addition, the micro motion at the <b>hip</b> <b>joint</b> (between the femoral head and the acetabulum) under varying loads is experimentally measured using a cemented and a cementless cadaveric <b>hip</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R
