25|$|This type of {{rounding}}, {{which is}} also named rounding to a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale,</b> is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment.

500|$|<b>Logarithmic</b> <b>scales</b> {{are useful}} for {{quantifying}} the relative change of a value as opposed to its absolute difference. Moreover, because the logarithmic function [...] grows very slowly for large x, <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scales</b> are used to compress large-scale scientific data.

Together with a harmonic oscillator, the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale</b> and Runge-Lenz vector, the map τ corresponds to a Kepler motion on a conic section in symplectic plane P. The action of dilations of metaplectic group on the propagators on the light cone of the wave equation and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale</b> on the centre of the Heisenberg group G=ℝ·e+P yield Kepler's third law. This is related to Bradley's aberration method to verify optically the motion of the Earth around the Sun...|$|R
