5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E

Identity-based theoretical frameworks, including theories of social identity, social categorization theory, and psychodynamics are used to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> terrorism occurs.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his removal, Parkin {{had given}} {{talks on the}} role of U.S. {{military}} contractor Halliburton in the Iraq war and led a small protest outside the Sydney headquarters of Halliburton subsidiary KBR. The Attorney-General at that time, Philip Ruddock, refused to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for Parkin's removal, leading to speculation that ASIO had acted under pressure from the United States. This was denied by O'Sullivan before a Senate committee, where he gave evidence that ASIO based its assessment only on Parkin's activities in Australia. O'Sullivan refused to answer questions before a later Senate committee hearing after his legal counsel told the Federal Court that ASIO did not necessarily base its assessment solely on Parkin's activities in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Margaret Rossiter, an American {{historian}} of science, offered three concepts to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> behind {{the data in}} statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in the science industry. The first concept is hierarchical segregation. This is a well-known phenomenon in society, that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige, the smaller the population of females participating. The hierarchical differences {{point out that there}} are fewer women participating at higher levels of both academia and industry. Based on data collected in 1982, women earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States, with 50 percent of these in science. The source also indicated that this number increased almost every year. There are fewer women at the graduate level; they earn 40 percent of all doctorates, with 31 percent of these in science and engineering.|$|E

25|$|On 10 January 2013, the Viterbo court {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the case for judgement directly to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court ruled on 20 June 2013, that the Chamber of Deputies decree having extended Berlusconi's immunity beyond what was provided for by the constitution, was a case with conflict of powers and should be disregarded. This mean that Berlusconi does not enjoy any special immunity protection for his spoken words during election campaigns, and that a court case now shall be held by the constitutional court, to decide {{the merits of the}} case. Before the case against Berlusconi can begin, the Italian Chamber of Deputies however shall be called for trial to defend and <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for passing their unconstitutional law from 2010. The court hearing against the Chamber of Deputies took place on 8 July 2014, where the constitutional court was asked to deem the concerned Chamber of Deputies decree to be unconstitutional and annul it, by the Court of Rome and the Viterbo court. On 18 July 2014, the Constitutional Court indeed ruled the decree to be unconstitutional and annulled it; meaning that the civil court proceedings against Berlusconi now can continue.|$|E
500|$|The Hardy Boys {{have been}} called [...] "a {{cultural}} touchstone all over the world." [...] Their adventures have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000books had been sold, and as of 2008 the books were selling over a million copies a year (the first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, alone sells over 100,000copies a year). Worldwide, over 70million copies of Hardy Books have been sold. A number of critics have tried to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the characters' longevity.|$|E
500|$|Gettysburg {{became a}} postbellum {{focus of the}} [...] "Lost Cause", a {{movement}} by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. However, they claim it also suffered because Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures {{of some of his}} key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for {{a key part of the}} campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.|$|E

500|$|The {{second act}} {{continues}} the prosecution's case, with Flint calling John Graham Whitfield—Faulkner's father-in-law {{and president of}} Whitfield National Bank. He testifies about a large loan he made to Faulkner. In his cross-examination, defense attorney Stevens suggests the loan was used to buy Faulkner's marriage to Whitfield's daughter. After this testimony, the prosecution rests and the defense argument begins. A handwriting expert testifies about the signature on the suicide note. Faulkner's bookkeeper describes events between Andre's dismissal and the night of Faulkner's death, and related financial matters. Andre takes the stand and describes her relationship with Faulkner as both his lover and his partner in financial fraud. She says she did not resent his marriage {{because it was a}} business deal to secure credit from the Whitfield Bank. As she starts to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for Faulkner's alleged suicide, she is interrupted by the arrival of [...] "Guts" [...] Regan, an infamous gangster, who tells Andre that Faulkner is dead. Despite being on trial for Faulkner's murder, Andre is shocked by this news and faints.|$|E
500|$|Three main {{theories}} {{attempt to}} <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the [...] "Hungarian land-taking". One {{argues that it}} was an intended military operation, prearranged following previous raids, with the express purpose of occupying a new homeland. This view (represented, for instance, by Bakay and Padányi) mainly follows the narration of Anonymous and later Hungarian chronicles. The opposite view maintains that a joint attack by the Pechenegs and the Bulgarians forced the Hungarians' hand. Kristó, Tóth and the theory's other followers refer to the unanimous testimony provided by the Annals of Fulda, Regino of Prüm and Porphyrogenitus on the connection between the Hungarians' conflict with the Bulgar-Pecheneg coalition and their withdrawal from the Pontic steppes. An intermediate theory proposes that the Hungarians had for decades been considering a westward move when the Bulgarian-Pecheneg attack accelerated their decision to leave the Pontic steppes. For instance Róna-Tas argues, [...] " [...] fact that, despite a series of unfortunate events, the Magyars managed to keep their heads above water goes to show that they were indeed ready to move on" [...] when the Pechenegs attacked them.|$|E

[...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, in {{a letter}} to his uncle on 28 December, Bellini tried to <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the reactions.

Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers (after rehearsing the entire second act on the day of the premiere) as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please—and failed to please the composer as well! But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective. It appears from the letter that the second evening's performance was more successful and Weinstock reports it was from this performance forward that it [...] "was recognised as a successful and important opera" [...] with 208 performances given at La Scala alone by the end of the 19th century.|$|E

He also notes that on this second evening, the theatre was full.|$|E
