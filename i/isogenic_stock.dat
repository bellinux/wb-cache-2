40|$|Fruits {{of tomato}} (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cv. Rutgers {{and of a}} nearly <b>isogenic</b> <b>stock</b> {{containing}} the ripening inhibitor gene rin harvested at green (66 % mature) and ripe (107 % mature) stages were studied for the subcellular distribution of isoenzymes using isoelectric focusing. The enzymes studied were peroxidases, esterases, phosphatases, phosphorylase, malate dehydrogenases, and IAA oxidases. During ripening of normal fruit the activities in the supernatant fraction {{of all of these}} enzymes, except malate dehydrogenase, decreased. In the particulate fractions some enzymes decreased while others increased in activity. The rin gene inhibited only some of the changes which occurred during ripening of normal fruit. It is postulated that changes in the degree to which enzymes are bound to membranes comprise one of the mechanisms by which the activities of enzymes are controlled in tomato pericarp, and that these membranes remain intact during ripening...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Measuring the {{evolutionary}} rate of reproductive isolation {{is essential to}} understanding how new species form. Tempo calculations typically rely on fossil records, geological events, and molecular evolution analyses. The speed at which genetically-based hybrid mortality arises, or the 2 ̆ 01 cincompatibility clock 2 ̆ 01 d, {{is estimated to be}} millions of years in various diploid organisms and is poorly understood in general. Owing to these extended timeframes, seldom do biologists observe the evolution of hybrid mortality in real time. Results Here we report the very recent spread and fixation of complete asymmetric F 1 hybrid mortality within eight years of laboratory maintenance in the insect model Nasonia. The asymmetric interspecific hybrid mortality evolved in an <b>isogenic</b> <b>stock</b> line of N. longicornis and occurs in crosses to N. vitripennis males. The resulting diploid hybrids exhibit complete failure in dorsal closure during embryogenesis. Conclusion These results comprise a unique case whereby a strong asymmetrical isolation barrier evolved in real time. The spread of this reproductive isolation barrier notably occurred in a small laboratory stock subject to recurrent bottlenecks...|$|E
40|$|Virtually all {{biomedical}} research {{makes use of}} a relatively small pool of laboratory-adapted, inbred, <b>isogenic</b> <b>stocks</b> of mice. Although the advantages of these models are many, {{there are a number}} of disadvantages as well. When studying a multifaceted process such as aging, the problems associated with using laboratory stocks are greatly inflated. On the other hand, wild-derived mouse stocks, loosely defined here as either wild-caught individuals or the recent progeny of wild-caught individuals, have much to offer to biogerontology research. Hence, the aims of this review are threefold: (1) to (re) acquaint readers with the pros and cons of using a typical inbred laboratory mouse model for aging research; (2) to reintroduce the notion of using wild-derived mouse stocks in aging research as championed by Austad, Miller and others for more than a decade, and (3) to provide an overview of recent advances in biogerontology using wild-derived mouse stocks...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to ascertain whether B chromosomes influence the susceptibility of maize (Zea mays L.) plants to gamma-radiation-induced DNA damage. <b>Isogenic</b> <b>stocks</b> of Black Mexican sweet corn with and without B chromosomes were premeiotically irradiated and DNA damage was assayed by measuring pollen viability. Higher pollen viabilities relative to non-irradiated control plants were consistently obtained in irradiated plants with B chromosomes when compared to irradiated plants without B's. Furthermore, among plants irradiated with 1250 R those with one B chromosome produced the greatest proportion of viable pollen and plants with increasing numbers of B's produced progressively less viable pollen. An exophenotypic trait elicited by B chromosomes is also reported. Plants with 5 or more B chromosomes often display an aberrant phenotype characterized by longitudinal white leaf stripes and/or narrow leaves. This phenotype intensifies with increasing numbers of B chromosomes and is the first case of a qualitative exophenotypic trait attributable to B chromosomes reported in maize...|$|R
40|$|A dosage {{series of}} the X {{chromosome}} site for serine- 4 transfer RNA consisting of one of three copies in females and one to two in males was constructed to test whether transfer RNA expression is governed by dosage compensation. A dosage effect {{on the level of}} the serine- 4 isoacceptor was observed in both females and males when the structural locus was varied. However, in males, each dose had a relatively greater expression so the normal one dose was slightly greater than the total female value and the duplicated male had the highest relative expression of all the types examined. Serine- 4 levels in males and females from an <b>isogenic</b> Oregon-R <b>stock</b> were similar. Thus the transfer RNA levels conform to the expectations of dosage compensation...|$|R
40|$|The B {{chromosomes}} {{of maize}} are condensed in appearance during interphase and are relatively inert genetically; therefore they fulfill {{the definition of}} heterochromatin. This heterochromatin was studied in root meristem cells by radioautography following administration of tritiated thymidine and cytidine, and was found to behave in a characteristic way, i. e. it showed asynchronous DNA synthesis and very low, if any, RNA synthesis. A cytochemical comparison of normal maize nuclei with nuclei from <b>isogenic</b> maize <b>stock</b> containing approximately 15 - 20 B-chromosomes {{in addition to the}} normal complement has revealed the following: (a) the DNA and histone contents are greater in nuclei with B chromosomes; (b) the proportion of DNA to histone is identical with that of nuclei containing only normal chromosomes; (c) the amount of nonhistone protein in proportion to DNA in interphase is less in nuclei with B chromosomes than in normal nuclei. In condensed B chromosomes the ratio of nonhistone protein to DNA is similar to that in other condensed chromatin, such as metaphase chromosomes and degenerating nuclei. The B chromosomes appear to have no effect on nucleolar RNA and protein. Replication of B chromosomes is precisely controlle...|$|R
