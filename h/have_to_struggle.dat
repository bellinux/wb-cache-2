5|$|Witton {{elaborated}} in 2012 and 2013 on {{the idea}} that Istiodactylus was a scavenger. Scavenging birds have a mosaic of strong and weak elements in their skulls; they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> with their prey, but {{need to be able to}} tear and pull morsels from cadavers. These birds also have relatively small eyes compared to predatory birds, as they do not need to search for hiding animals, or to make carefully judged attacks on their prey. Istiodactylus appears to have had large jaw muscles, and therefore a strong bite, and the skull was deep, which would have helped resist bending when pulling flesh. Individual bones of the skull were instead slender and shallow, and the toothrows were short, which indicates Istiodactylus did not have the necessary reinforcements for predation, and did not have to subdue struggling prey. Together, these features indicate Istiodactylus fed on large prey that necessitated strong jaws for processing, yet was also motionless enough so that strain on the jaws and skull could be controlled during feeding. The eyes of Istiodactylus also seem to have been proportionally small, compared to pterosaurs that are presumed to have been predatory (such as ornithocheirids). Witton concluded that among pterosaurs, Istiodactylus appears to have been the best-adapted for a scavenging lifestyle. He envisioned that istiodactylids would have to step back from a carcass if more powerful carnivores were attracted to it, but would return to finish the remains when those animals were satiated.|$|E

25|$|As {{multiple}} coins became common {{within a}} region, they were exchanged by moneychangers, the predecessors of today's foreign exchange market, as famously {{discussed in the}} Biblical story of Jesus and the money changers. In Venice and the Italian city states of the early Middle Ages, money changers would often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> to perform calculations involving six or more currencies. This partly led to Fibonacci writing his Liber Abaci where he popularised the use of Indo-Arabic numerals, which displaced the more difficult Roman numerals then in use by western merchants.|$|E

25|$|August {{started with}} a 234-run Championship loss to Lancashire, before they {{travelled}} down to the coast to beat Sussex in the National League. However, a loss against Surrey meant that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> to keep their promotion place in Division Two, as Durham were now tied on points with a game in hand. They played Durham in the Championship in {{the second week of}} August, and a rain-hit, high-scoring match ended in a draw. In the National League, however, they were bowled out for 113 and lost by eight wickets, losing ground in the promotion battle. Their second National League victory over Sussex in two weeks, however, meant that promotion in the National League was quite possible, and a rained off match with Warwickshire kept that battle tight.|$|E

500|$|Women's {{participation}} {{in the struggle for}} freedom developed their critical consciousness about their role and rights in independent India. This resulted in the introduction of the franchise and civic rights of women in the Indian constitution. There was provision for women's upliftment through affirmative action, maternal health and child care provision (crèches), equal pay for equal work etc. The state adopted a patronising role towards women. For example, India's constitution states that women are a [...] "weaker section" [...] of the population, and therefore need assistance to function as equals. Thus women in India did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> for basic rights as did women in the West. The utopia ended soon when the social and cultural ideologies and structures failed to honour the newly acquired concepts of fundamental rights and democracy.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès, in a psychoanalytical {{analysis}} of Tintin in Tibet, observes that Tintin is more firmly {{in control of}} the plot than he was in earlier adventures. Apostolidès notes that the character displays worry and emotion not present previously, something he suggested showed Tintin sorting out the problems that he faced in life. In his analysis, he calls Tintin a [...] "foundling" [...] and his friend Chang [...] "the lost child" [...] and [...] "Tintin's twin... the heroes <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> to great heights to escape the temporality and pervasive values of [...] universe." [...] He saw the Yeti, who [...] "internalises certain human characteristics", as more complex than Hergé's previous bestial character, Ranko in The Black Island: [...] "The monster loves Chang with a love as unconditional as Tintin's love for his friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Tropic Thunder {{was criticized}} by the {{disability}} advocacy community. The website for Simple Jack was withdrawn on August 4 amid several groups' concerns over its portrayal of mental retardation. A spokesman for DreamWorks said, [...] "We heard their concerns, and we understand that taken out of context, the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities." [...] A coalition of more than 20disability advocacy groups, including the Special Olympics and the Arc of the United States, objected to the film's repeated and excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "retard". DreamWorks offered to screen the film for the groups on August 8 to determine if it still offended them. The screening was postponed to the same day of the premiere on August 11. After representatives for the groups attended the private screening and were offended by its content, the groups picketed outside the film's premiere. Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, stated, [...] "This population struggles too much with the basics to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> against Hollywood. We're sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable." ...|$|E

500|$|On 20 January 1945, Quisling {{made what}} would be his final trip to visit Hitler. He promised Norwegian support in {{the final phase of}} the war if Germany agreed to a peace deal that would remove Norway's affairs from German intervention. This {{proposal}} grew out of a fear that as German forces retreated southwards through Norway, the occupation government would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> to keep control in northern Norway. To the horror of the Quisling regime, the Nazis instead decided on a scorched earth policy in northern Norway, {{going so far as to}} shoot Norwegian civilians who refused to evacuate the region. The period was also marked by increasing civilian casualties from Allied air raids, and mounting resistance to the government within occupied Norway. The meeting with the German leader proved unsuccessful and upon being asked to sign the execution order of thousands of Norwegian [...] "saboteurs," [...] Quisling refused, an act of defiance that so enraged Terboven, acting on Hitler's orders, that he stormed out of the negotiations. On recounting the events of the trip to a friend, Quisling broke down in tears, convinced the Nazi refusal to sign a peace agreement would seal his reputation as a traitor.|$|E
500|$|In late July 1967, {{following}} the failed Wuhan Uprising, Party leaders decided that Peng {{should be used}} as an example by publicly humiliating him by name at a national level. On July 31, an article appeared that was distributed nationally, and which directed the nation to take part in vilifying him. In this article, Peng was called a [...] "capitalist", a [...] "great ambitionist and great conspirator" [...] who had [...] "always opposed Chairman Mao", and who was [...] "the representative of the greatest capitalist-roader [...] in the army". The article accused Peng of conspiring with foreign countries, allying with [...] "imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries", and waging [...] "a wild attack against the Party". The campaign of national vilification against Peng lasted several months, until late 1967. On August 16 another article stated that Peng [...] "was never a Marxist", but that he had instead been a [...] "capitalist great warlord" [...] who had [...] "crept into the Party and into the army... we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> against him until he falls, until he breaks down, until he stinks." [...] CCP propagandists made an effort to discredit Peng's military career by portraying it as a long string of failures, except for those battles that were supposedly directed closely by Mao Zedong, and to convince the Chinese people that Peng was a subhuman villain who should be destroyed without compassion or mercy.|$|E
500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|One {{well known}} idea of his, expounded on in Michtav me-Eliyahu, is the Nekudas Habechira (point of free will). He states {{that a man}} has one point in his service to G-d where he has to fight his evil inclination, while at other points {{there will be no}} struggle, for the levels below his Nekudas Habechira have already been conquered, and he will easily win those battles of will; whereas levels higher than his Nekudas Habechira are not yet within his grasp. (For example, someone who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem keeping kosher, but may {{sometimes}} be tempted to rely on unreliable kosher supervision, while somebody farther away from religious practice will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>struggle</b> with whether to eat a ham sandwich (which is non-kosher regardless of supervision).) Each time one defeats the evil inclination by choosing to do good over evil, his Nekudas Habechira is raised a bit higher, and that choice will be easier for him to make in the future.
