[...] At the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, McKinley's keynote address sparked wild applause from a convention friendly to him.

McKinley, never a declared candidate, finished third, a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> behind Blaine, who had declared himself not to be a candidate.

60|$|Lady Hilda put in {{a stroke}} or two more to her pencil outline, and then {{continued}} her unsolicited confidences. 'Do you know, Mr. Le Breton,' she went on, 'there's a conspiracy--the usual conspiracy, but still a regular conspiracy I call it--between Papa and Mamma to make me marry that stick of a Connemara. What is there in him, I should like to know, to make any girl admire or love him? And yet half the girls in London {{would be glad to}} get him, for all his absurdity. It's monstrous, it's incomprehensible, it's abominable; but it's the fact. For my part, I must say I do like a little originality. And whenever I hear Papa, and Uncle Sussex, and Lord Connemara talking at dinner, it does seem to me too ridiculously absurd that they should each have a separate voice in Parliament, and that you shouldn't even have a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> for a county member. What sort of superiority has Lord Connemara over you, I wonder?' And she looked at Ernest again with a searching glance, to see whether he was to be moved by such a personal and emphatic way of putting the matter.|$|E

Vietnam, which had meant so much in the solidarity work of KFML/SKP, and Cambodia, [...] "their" [...] ally, had become involved in the Cambodian-Vietnamese War, fighting against each other. And SKP, who had succeeded in getting famous in Swedish politics, had not been able to expand and get more than <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> percent in <b>votes.</b> From 1982 and onwards, they supported the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the national elections. Many members, both leaders and base militants left the movement. The party became seriously ideologically disoriented.|$|R
