50|$|The shaft {{is located}} on the {{southern}} side of Towers Hill with access via Chloride Street. The shaft lies at the intersection of upper Chloride Street and Percy Street but as both of these streets are unformed, access to the shaft is through open bush commencing from the private road to the Microwave Repeater Station. The shaft itself is open and well defined behind a chain wire safety fence (14m x 14m). The opening to the shaft is 6m x 4m wide and is filled with water to approximately 1.5m from the surface. Within the fence there are the remains of one of the mine's head <b>frame</b> <b>leg</b> footings, and outside the fence on the eastern side are some small mullock heaps. Remains of concrete foundations are found scattered around the shaft, but none are intact.|$|E
40|$|Glulam {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} the chosen material of timber frame structures. Of those, three-hinged (three-pin) portal frames are incomparably {{the most common}} type. Being both statically determinate and stable against horizontal forces in its own plane o er both practical (basic constructive details) and economical bene ts. The design of the haunch allows for various solutions: it can be curved with continuous laminates, nger jointed, jointed with steel dowels and slotted-in plates, or built-up with a strut. The form of the frame derives from the main load's force line. The most appropriate forms for large spans are curved or built-up haunches, as they ful l both functional and aesthetic aspects. Three-pin portal frames are suitable for spans up to 30 - 40 meters, being the limiting factor the transport feasability of the frame's halves. In recent years a handful of three-hinged structures with built-up haunches have collapsed, leaving behind a need to analyse and study the stresses and resistance of this structures. For obvious reasons it is specially interesting to research and clarify the fracture risk on the built-up haunches {{as well as to}} map the stresses created by the inner <b>frame</b> <b>leg</b> through compression to the lower edge of the frame rafter. Today there is only one general method used to design built-up haunches, present in both the Glulam Handbook and the German Institute for Standardization, DIN, which is based on established practice. Both standards share similar simpli cations and assumtions, giving surprisingly little importance to the shear stress that occurs in the contact area of the built-up haunch. The aim of this master's thesis was to put together a tool, in form of a diagram, to help design the built-up haunch, with particular emphasis on the contact area between the inner <b>frame</b> <b>leg</b> and the frame rafter, and the subsequent shear stresses this contact creates on the rafter. To achieve this result a sample frame rafter was calculated using 2 D frame software and generic loads and materials. The section forces obtained were then used to create a FEM model of the built-up haunch. This FEM model provided a clearer understanding of the behaviour of the frame leg-frame rafter's contact area as well as yielding a map of the shear stresses present in the joint. Finally with the use of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and the mean stress criterion a diagram-tool was created. This report yielded two results that may be deemed of special interest: - Both the Glulam Handbook and the german DIN standard relegate the shear stress in the notch as merely a design checkout, never a design factor. - Both the Glulam Handbook and the DIN completely disregard the size e ects in the capacity of birdmouth joints. The fracture mechanics calculations presented in this report provide prove of strong size e ects, so that current design standards signi cantly overestimate the capacity of great-sized built-up haunches. This conclusion could be important in practical terms, and should be further investigated. Experimental tests should also be inlcuded in future research.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of some main {{components}} of a lunar rover assigned to working tasks. The main task of this rover is to clear areas of the lunar soil allocated to the building of a lunar base. In {{the first part of the}} work the lunar environment is studied and described with particular attention to the rover tasks. The rover in the final configuration will be able to advance in all directions on the soil, to control the attitude and to grasp and to remove obstacle and object on the soil. It will be provided by a <b>frame,</b> <b>legs</b> and will, grasping system. The design of the lifting system for the attitude control, based on the action of four motorized legs, has been approached with particular regard to the structural characteristics and to the transmission and motorization. The transmission of the lifting system uses a precision coupling between a lead screw and nut, driven by electrical motors. To allow optimal working conditions for the lead screw and nut, the lifting device was designed as a compact apparatus which also comprises a particular joint which is capable to uncouple shear and bending loads transmitted to it from the other parts. The design of the components has to keep into account the peculiar characteristics of the lunar environment. This aspect was considered by an appropriate geometrical design of the components and a careful choice of the materials. The gripper mechanism of the rover is designed to operate without dedicated motors and it is able to be self-adaptive to the shape of the picked up item also if the object is placed in a non defined position, in any case in a working space. The design optimization of the grasping mechanism, choosing shape and dimension of the different arms, was performed by means of parametric modeling and numerical simulations. Finally an innovative type of wheel was designed and realized to verify the real ability to operate. The wheel is a non pneumatic system with and integrated suspension and energy scavenging system to power the sensors and control system on board. ...|$|R
