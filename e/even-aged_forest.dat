50|$|What {{separates}} shelterwood cuttings {{from other}} regeneration systems, such as clearcutting or seed tree, {{is that the}} new seedlings are established before the mature trees are fully (or mostly) removed. This gives the forester more control over the species that are regenerated, and is more forgiving if the first regeneration effort fails. All mature trees may be removed, creating a young <b>even-aged</b> <b>forest,</b> or a considerable number of reserves may be kept to provide a two-aged structure. Small woodlot owners often prefer this method for the control it gives and also because the income from the harvest is spread out over a decade or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Even-aged</b> <b>forest</b> {{management}} is the harvesting system {{of choice in}} many parts of the world because it is often considered to be the only method that is economically viable. Forestry operations have extremely high variable costs- per hour expenses for harvesting equipment and per kilometer expenses for log transportation compose a very large portion of the total cost to harvest a stand. Therefore, companies must obtain as much productivity as possible from their hourly equipment in order to be profitable. Uneven-aged management techniques where only certain trees are harvested, such as shelterwood systems, incur the same hourly costs while harvesting fewer trees per hour. This reality explains why in Canada, for example, 90% of forests harvested are done so by clear cut through an even-aged management system.|$|E

40|$|Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are {{a primary}} prey species for Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in western North America. Lynx {{management}} plans require knowledge of potential prey distribution and abundance {{in the western}} United States. Whether <b>even-aged</b> regenerating <b>forests</b> or multi-storied forests contain more snowshoe hares is currently unknown. During 2006 – 2008, we estimated snowshoe hare density in 3 classes of 30 – 70 -year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and 4 classes of late seral multi-storied forest with a spruce (Picea engelmannii) -fir (Abies lasiocarpa) component in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming. We recorded physiographic variables and forest structure characteristics to understand how these factors influence abundance of snowshoe hares. In many instances, snowshoe hares were more abundant in late seral multi-storied <b>forests</b> than regenerating <b>even-aged</b> <b>forests.</b> Forest attributes predicting hare abundance were often more prevalent in multi-storied forests. Late seral multi-storied forests with a spruce–fir component and dense horizontal cover, as well as 30 – 70 -year-old lodge-pole pine with high stem density, were disproportionately influential in explaining snowshoe hare densities in western Wyoming. In order to promote improved habitat conditions for snowshoe hares in this region, management agencies should consider shifting their focus towards maintaining, enhancing, and promoting multi-storied forests with dense horizontal cover, as well as developing 30 – 70 -year-old lodge-pole pine stands with high stem density that structurally mimic multi-storied forests...|$|R

5000|$|A {{high forest}} {{is a type}} of forest {{originated}} from seed or from planted seedlings. In contrast to a low forest (also known as a coppice forest), a high forest usually consists of large, tall mature trees with a closed canopy.

A high <b>forest</b> can be <b>even-aged</b> or uneven-aged. [...] <b>Even-aged</b> <b>forests</b> contain trees of one, or two successional age classes (generations).

There are, however, substantial differences in this homogeneity between different forest types that may necessitate variation in plot sizes to accommodate this. This homogeneity ranges from high (in very dense unthinned planted stands with few gaps) through moderate (in thinned planted stands with greater ground area) to low (in natural forests).|$|R
30|$|Regarding boreal forests, the {{conception}} of simple directional and deterministic forest development, starting from ‘bare ground’ and ending in static old-growth “climax” state, has by and large been the ‘norm model’, which is underlying the contemporary forest management paradigm and practices. However, the original reason why this conception received a dominant position was not the lack of realization that more complex forest structures and dynamics are naturally common, but rather the necessity to adopt a sufficiently simple conceptual model {{that could be used}} to organize rational forest management and for example to construct forest yield tables to predict forest growth. It was only afterwards that {{the conception}} of <b>even-aged</b> <b>forest</b> development was canonized as a ‘natural’ model of boreal forest dynamics. Hence, virtue was made out of necessity. As a result this history, the assumption that the directional model of <b>even-aged</b> <b>forest</b> development adequately represents intrinsic boreal forest dynamics has become deeply rooted in the mindset of forestry professionals and has therefore also profoundly influenced the adoption and development of silvicultural and forest management methods. What is worse, the adoption of this simplified conception has created “knowledge lock-ins” among professionals, which have seriously impeded the application of ecological knowledge in forest management (Puettmann et al. 2008; Moen et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|This kind of dichotomic {{conceptual}} model could {{be applicable to}} old-growth dominated landscapes driven predominantly by small scale gap dynamics, which are punctuated with relatively rare but severe fires or storms (Syrjänen et al. 1994; Seymour et al. 2002). In such a case the forest landscape would consist {{of a combination of}} two very different kinds of dynamics, which are spatially and temporally separated: old gap dynamic forest (small cycle) and patches of younger <b>even-aged</b> <b>forest</b> regenerating after stand-replacing disturbance (large cycle) (Sirén 1955; Kuuluvainen et al. 1998).|$|E
30|$|Although the {{programme}} had {{its origins}} in the stochastic analysis of radiata pine plantations, it is widely applicable to other species of even-aged plantations and forests.

In particular, anthropogenic disturbances from <b>even-aged</b> <b>forests</b> management lead {{to a decline in}} late-successional forest structures and an increase in structurally monotonous young forest, mostly originating from plantings. This can in the long run cause local extinctions of species, which depend on natural forests and their specific properties, such as diverse dead wood (Hanski 2000; Rassi et al. 2010). In Fennoscandia, the grand challenges of ecosystem management are to reverse the trend in declining biodiversity and patiently strive for a more balanced state between different dimensions of sustainability.|$|R

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} needs tools that can predict how silvicultural treatments will affect cutting stands. Growth and yield systems are {{an example of}} these tools because they can represent periods of growth and yield of a stand in numerical terms. The aim {{of this research was}} to develop a dynamic growth and yield timber system with the stand-level models approach for Pinus patula in <b>even-aged</b> <b>forests</b> of Ixtlán de Juárez, Oaxaca, Mexico. The data was obtained from two consecutive remeasurements of 66 permanent 400 m 2 plots.

Mortality was fitted by the non-linear least squares method. A model of dominant height and site index (Levakovic II) with polymorphism was related to basal area, DBH, total volume ha− 1 and mortality equations. The growth system generated an average optimal age rotation of 32 years when the current annual increment (CAI) was the same as the mean annual increment (MAI) for the mean site index and a density of 1500 trees ha− 1 at five years.

40|$|In {{the field}} of forest planning, {{assumptions}} regarding the appropriate modeling of management behavior, translated through management prescriptions, minimum harvest ages, green-up periods, and other variables are needed if a stand-level optimization process is not used to guide the selection of stand management regimes Forest planners thus generally have a few options regarding the level of detail of management intentions they can model, from detailed, finely-tuned assumptions to coarser, less detailed assumptions. The question of interest to this study is whether similar forest plan results can be obtained over a range of detail assumed in the management intentions.

However, few studies have considered both diversity and spatial patterning at a stand scale. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of forest management on understory plant communities in northern hardwood forests and assess the processes governing differences in species composition, diversity, and spatial patterns. We sampled understory vegetation (all speciestall) and percentage of light transmission levels in three forest types in 12 mesic northern hardwood stands in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA: old-growth, undisturbed forests; <b>even-aged</b> <b>forests</b> resulting from clearcut logging (65 – 85 yr old); and uneven-aged forests with recent selective logging. Estimated understory species richness per stand, mean species richness per quadrat, and mean percent cover per quadrat were lower in old-growth <b>forest</b> than in <b>even-aged,</b> second-growth <b>forests</b> and lower in even-aged than in uneven-aged, second-growth forests. Differences in species composition among the three forest types were related to available light and to coarse woody debris; however, differences between the cover of most plant groups were not significant. The mean patch size of species diversity and cover is highly variable {{and could not be}} related to forest stand type. However, understory communities in old-growth forests have significantly smaller community patch sizes and larger compositional heterogeneity. Community patch size is correlated with both coarse woody debris and light heterogeneity. Each forest stand type produces a characteristic combination of understory composition, diversity, and spatial patterning of communities. Although harvesting has negligible effects on understory alpha diversity in these mesic hardwood forests, spatial structure is slower to recover and has not recovered in the even- and uneven-aged northern hardwood forests studied. If management objectives include preserving or restoring the ecological character of the forest, harvesting may need to be altered or delayed predicated on the character of the understory...|$|R

While kelo trees have largely disappeared from populated areas already more than 100  years ago (Kalliola 1966), the onset of industrial forest management has led to decline in kelo populations also in more remote parts of Fennoscandia.
