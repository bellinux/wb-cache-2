At the <b>die</b> <b>bonder,</b> even 5 µm must be achieved. With such a precision, roller bearings reach their physical limit without a lower acceleration.

5000|$|During dicing, wafers are {{typically}} mounted on dicing tape {{which has a}} sticky backing that holds the wafer on a thin sheet metal frame. Dicing tape has different properties depending on the dicing application. UV curable tapes are used for smaller sizes and non-UV dicing tape for larger die sizes. Once a wafer has been diced, the pieces left on the dicing tape {{are referred to as}} die, dice or dies. Each will be packaged in a suitable package or placed directly on a printed circuit board substrate as a [...] "bare die". The areas that have been cut away, called die streets, {{are typically}} about 75 micrometres (0.003 inch) wide. Once a wafer has been diced, the die will stay on the dicing tape until they are extracted by die-handling equipment, such as a <b>die</b> <b>bonder</b> or die sorter, further in the electronics assembly process.|$|E

40|$|Advanced Packaging and {{especially}} Flip Chip Assembly has an increased importance in modern microelectronics industry. Flip Chip and miniaturized packaging is being implemented in volume productions in consumer products in mobile telecommunication {{as well as}} in advanced high end automotive and aerospace industry. One additional aspect which goes with the miniaturization is the implementation of new substrates {{and especially}} low cost flexible substrates for 3 D – packaging in this industry. One main requirement is infrastructure for bumping. There are several processes, technologies and companies worldwide proving this infrastructure. In the equipment field, the majority of today’s Flip Chip Bonders is derived from modified SMD – equipment respectively from modified <b>die</b> <b>bonder</b> equipment. The majority of the Flip Chip Assembly Processes are based on soldering, however adhesive attach is having a stronger and more important impact in Flip Chip Technology. Adhesive attach is especially interesting in applications on flexible circuits, like LCD drivers and smart cards. The methods of flip attach are all using thermal energy by either reflow convection ovens or a thermal based on heated tools (thermode) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTHigh-speed and {{precision}} positioning are fundamental requirements for high-acceleration low-load mechanisms in integrated circuit (IC) packaging equipment. In this paper, we derive the transient nonlinear dynamicresponse equations of high-acceleration mechanisms, which reveal that stiffness, frequency, damping, and driving frequency {{are the primary}} factors. Therefore, we propose a new structural optimization and velocity-planning method for the precision positioning of a high-acceleration mechanism based on optimal spatial and temporal distribution of inertial energy. For structural optimization, we first reviewed the commonly flexible multibody dynamic optimization using equivalent static loads method (ESLM), and then we selected the modified ESLM for optimal spatial distribution of inertial energy; hence, not only the stiffness but also the inertia and frequency of the real modal shapes are considered. For velocity planning, we developed a new velocity-planning method based on nonlinear dynamic-response optimization with varying motion conditions. Our method was verified on a high-acceleration <b>die</b> <b>bonder.</b> The amplitude of residual vibration could be decreased by more than 20 % via structural optimization and the positioning time could be reduced by more than 40 % via asymmetric variable velocity planning. This method provides an effective theoretical support for the precision positioning of high-acceleration low-load mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Cracked die is {{a serious}} failure mode in the Light Emitting Diode (LED) {{industry}} – affecting LED quality and long-term reliability performance. In this paper an investigation {{has been carried out}} to find the correlation between severe cracked germanium (Ge) substrate of an aluminum indium gallium phosphate (AlInGaP) LED and its electro-optical performance after the Temperature Cycle (TC) test. The LED dice were indented at several bond forces using a <b>die</b> <b>bonder.</b> The indented dice were analysed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The result showed that severe cracks were observed at 180 gF onward. As the force of indentation increases, crack formation also becomes more severe thus resulting in the chipping of the substrate. The cracked dies were packaged and the TC test was performed. The results did not show any electro-optical failure or degradation, even after a 1000 cycle TC test. Several mechanically cross-sectioned cracked die LEDs, were analysed using SEM and found that no crack reached the active layer. This shows that severely cracked Ge substrate are able to withstand a − 40 °C/+ 100 °C TC test up to 1000 cycles and LED optical performance is not affected. A small leakage current was observed in all of the cracked die LEDs in comparison to the reference unit. However, this value is smaller than the product specification and is of no concern...|$|E
40|$|Spectrometers and Spectrographs {{based on}} {{scanning}} grating monochromators are well-established tools for various applications. As new applications came into {{focus in the}} last few years, there is a demand for more sophisticated and miniaturized systems. The next generation spectroscopic devices should exhibit very small dimensions and low power consumption, respectively. We have developed a spectroscopic system with a volume of only (15 × 10 × 14) mm 3 and a few milliwatts of power consumption that has the potential to fulfill the demands of the upcoming applications. Our approach is based on two dierent strategies. First, we apply resonantly driven MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems). The latest generation of our MEMS scanning grating device has two integrated optical slits and piezoresistive position detection in addition to the already existing miniaturized 1 -d scanning grating plate and the electrostatic driving mechanism. Our second strategy is {{to take advantage of the}} hybrid integration of optical components by highly sophisticated manufacturing technologies. One objective is the combination of MEMS technology and a planar mounting approach, which potentially facilitate the mass production of spectroscopic systems and a signicant reduction of cost per unit. We present the optical system design as well as the realization of a miniaturized scanning grating spectrometer for the near infrared (NIR) range between 950 nm and 1900 nm with a spectral resolution of 10 nm. The MEMS devices as well as the optical components have been manufactured and rst samples of the spectroscopic measurement device have been mounted by an automated <b>die</b> <b>bonder...</b>|$|E
40|$|The current feed {{capability}} of typical flip chip electrical interconnects is {{constrained by the}} solder alloy, as it is more susceptible to electromigration than the copper used for the pads and wires. Hence, interconnects formed by copper only mitigate the electromigration risk and/or allow to increase the current limit of the all-copper interconnect. In this work, two methods to form all-copper flip chip interconnects at an annealing temperature of 250 °C are presented. The interconnects in the contact region between Cu pillars and Cu pads with a pitch down to 150 μm are formed by Cu nanoparticle self-assembly and sintering. In the first method, the entire gap between a Cu pillar chip and a substrate {{was filled with a}} Cu nano-suspension. The formation of capillary bridges during the evaporation of the dispersant directed the self-assembly of the nanoparticles towards the contact region between Cu pillars and Cu pad. In the second method, the Cu pillar chip was dipped into a film of the Cu nano-suspension, followed by a transfer, placement and release with a <b>die</b> <b>bonder</b> onto pads on a substrate. The annealing of the Cu nanoparticles is performed in both cases in a reducing formic acid atmosphere. The first method was more susceptible to the formation of shorts between pillars, whereas the second method resulted in electrical functional chip to substrate assemblies. Interconnects with a mean electrical resistance of 26 ± 3 mΩ and a shear strength ranging from 4. 6 to 12. 3 MPa were achieved. The sintered Cu nanoparticles bridged gaps up to 10 μm between copper pillars and pads, demonstrating the potential to apply the joint also on non-planar substrates. Nevertheless, imperfections such as voids and cracks are still present in the joints and need further process development, to improve the quality and process robustness further...|$|E
