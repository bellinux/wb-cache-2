It will improve the heat balance of the system, since the carbonisation of wood will deliver a lot of high caloricity pyroligneous vapour to the joint furnace of the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant". Pine wood sleeper sapwood contains 0. 25 % of sulphur, but the average pine sleeper wood (sapwood and heartwood) 0. 05 % of sulphur. Most of the sulphur is lost with the pyroligneous vapour and burned in the furnace.

The considered process is suitable for small power plants, if the biomass input in the common energy balance is 5 to 10 %. If the mean distance of sleepers transportation for Central and Eastern Europe is estimated not to exceed 200 km, the co-combustion of clean coal and carbonized sleepers would be an acceptable option from the environmental and economic points of view...|$|R

This has the added benefit of reducing carbon emissions. The larger combustion units also have a more advanced <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> than single boiler systems. In the case of surplus heat from industries, district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment.|$|E
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution.

The higher SOx concentrations, particularly sulfur trioxide (SO 3) {{in combination with}} high concentration {{of water in the}} recycled <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> increase the sulfuric acid dew point temperature in oxy-fuel fired systems, thereby increasing allowable <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperatures and reducing the thermal efficiency of a power plant.

Three Australian coals that have previously been tested under air and oxy-fuel conditions at the Aioi furnace of IHI in Japan were used in the experiments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} experiments {{carried out at}} a 20 kW combustion rig simulating different extents of oxy-fuel recycle <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> by impurities injection to the oxidant gas of the once-through combustion reactor. A comprehensive set of total (Hg tot), elemental (Hg 0) and oxidized (Hg) mercury as well as SO 3 concentrations was obtained {{before and after the}} combustion rig's baghouse filter for in total 14 air and oxy-fuel experiments with 3 Australian coals. Based on this data, an assessment in respect to Hg oxidation, SO 2 /SO 3 conversion and Hg and SO 3 capture on the test rig's filter was performed. The air and the oxy-fuel experiments with different extents of recycle <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning,</b> revealed differences in the Hg and SO 3 formation and capture behavior: the Hg /Hg tot ratios in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> are higher during oxy-fuel combustion compared to air-firing. This effect is even more pronounced at the filter outlet, after <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> has passed through the filter ash. In some experiments, even a net oxidation of Hg 0 entering the filter to Hg was observed. The Hg capture by ash in the baghouse filter has been found to reduce the Hg emissions considerably. However, the Hg capture was altered by the different oxy-fuel recycle configurations, leading to decreased Hg capture efficiencies on the filter for one of the coals. A coal-specific trend of increased SO 2 /SO 3 conversion ratios with increased <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> SO 2 levels was observed that could be related to the ash composition of the three different coals. This and the higher SO 2 concentrations in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> lead to considerably higher SO 3 levels in oxy-fuel combustion with SO 2 recycling. During the experiments, also a considerable capture of SO 3 in the baghouse filter was observed (up to 80 % under air- and up to 66 % under oxy-fired conditions). A reduction of the SO 3 capture on the filter under oxy-fuel conditions {{may be related to the}} higher SO 3 levels in this process...|$|R

40|$|Control of {{particulate}} matter (PM) emissions from industrial processes {{is important for}} protection of {{human health and the}} environment. A promising technique for submicron PM abatement is by condensing water vapor onto the particles, which enhances particle growth and improves the performance of traditional particle collection devices. This thesis analyzes the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> <b>cleaning</b> process by means of activation heterogeneous water nucleation mechanism on particles surface as a function of working condition, inlet temperature and vapor concentration, with particular emphasis on the effect of their dimension, number concentration, morphology and chemical nature on nucleation activation process. The temporal evolution of particles growths process has been studied with a proper experimental apparatus. Submicronic particles with a different wettability (C, Fe and Ni) have been produced by means of an aerosol spark generator. Vapor condensation on submicronic particles has been followed along the axis of the laminar flow chamber in dependence of operative conditions and particles characteristics by measuring the intensity of vertical and horizontal component of elastically scattered light and then evaluating the polarization ratio. Furthermore a series of off-line measurements have been performed to characterize solid particles. The results obtained represent a first database for kinetic data of condensation process. They show that particle growth mechanism involves different physical processes. By means a specific numerical modeling the polarization ratio of composite sphere made by a water shell hosting a solid particles was been calculated. In such a way the final size of droplet and so the particle growth factor have been evaluated. The main result obtained is that particle covering process related to its morphology and chemical properties is active at under-saturation conditions even if their size variation is relatively low. While for supersaturation conditions the particles coverage is enhanced by mass transport of vapor toward particles surface. In such a case the final size of the composite droplet is of the order of micron. It is worthwhile to note that both mechanisms are particularly effective for particles capture showing an unitary activation efficiency in the operative conditions considered. It is worth noting that extreme working conditions may be useful for the particle coverage. In addition, this work demonstrated that the theoretical prediction related to classical nucleation theory could be used to determine the process effectiveness at higher vapor concentration and lower inlet temperature, even though it fails to predict the induction time. At low values of vapor concentration, this approach was not valid in predicting the occurrence of the vapor condensation on particles. For this purpose the theory of capillary condensation seems to be an useful tool to predict the vapor deposition on particles and the induction time of growth process in so severe condition. In this PhD thesis, it was assessed that the characteristic induction and growth times are compatible with practical applications. The identification and estimation of this information can be useful in the design and dimensioning of a real abatement unit...|$|R
