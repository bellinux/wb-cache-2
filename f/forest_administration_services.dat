This junior Montgomery branch originates from the Welsh borders branch of Montgomerys, who arrived with the Duke William in 1066. The Derbyshire Montgomerys held manors round the Tutbury area being; Rolleston, Marston, Cubley and Marchington and were charged with <b>Forest</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services</b> for the vast Needwood forest which was overseen by the Ferrers Earls of Derby as a royal forest. The also provided Knight services. Thomas Marchington's family line seems to have died out as no direct trace can be found.

50|$|The Copper Mountain Fire Lookout {{was built}} in 1934 {{in what was then}} the Glacier Ranger {{district}} of Mount Baker National Forest. The cabin-like wood frame lookout is a frame cabin with large windows on each side protected by an awning-style shutter. A shingled gable roof with prominent lightning rods covers the cabin. The lookout measures 14.25 ft by 14.25 ft square. During the winter of 1943 the lookout was manned by the Aircraft Warning Service, watching for enemy aircraft. It is one of three lookouts remaining in North Cascades National Park from the <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to its {{nomination}} to the National Register:The Brush Creek Work Center is significant ... for its association with expansion of <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> <b>administration</b> from custodial superintendence to active resource management. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, it reflects the contribution of this Federal Works program {{to the expansion of}} Forest Service resource management during the 1930's. It is also significant architecturally because it embodies a distinctive style of architecture developed by the Forest Service during the Depression-era. The use of standard plans was typical of remote Forest Service installations and the log building style conformed well with the forested surroundings. The buildings represent a distinctive Forest Service architectural design style and philosophy.|$|R

30|$|Loveridge’s {{ultimate}} {{response to}} Koch’s heretical essay, however, did not arrive until {{later in the}} spring of 1935. Loveridge could not match Koch’s prose, but he could outmaneuver him within the hierarchal ranks of <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> <b>administration.</b> At the regional foresters conference in April 1935, Loveridge answered Koch even more forcefully by proposing what was to become known as the 10 AM Policy (Pyne 1982). With Show’s lobbying, Loveridge’s proposed policy was unanimously approved by the assembled brass (Pyne 1982), and formalized as Forest Service policy on 7 May 1935, in a letter from Chief Silcox to agency staff (Loveridge 1943). Loveridge finally got what he so earnestly wanted—a universal fire suppression policy that applied even to low value backcountry lands. Loveridge had championed his cause for years (USFS 1932), but it was Koch’s eloquent article that finally created the opportunity Loveridge needed to bring about the 10 AM Policy.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of Grand Teton National Park there were 111 forest leases, a legacy of U.S. <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> <b>administration</b> of lands that were {{incorporated}} into the new park. Ben Sheffield received a Forest Service lease for a parcel on Jackson Lake in 1930. The Sheffield house burned in the 1940s and the lease was purchased by Zachery K. Brinkerhoff Sr. and his son in 1947 from R.E. McConaughy. The Brinkerhoffs were the owners of an oil development company, the Brinkerhoff Drilling company. They hired Wiling to design their retreat, which was built by Scotty Sloten and four carpenters of Swedish descent from the Wind River valley, experienced in log construction. The house was furnished with furniture and accessories made by Western-style designer Thomas C. Molesworth. The house was sold to the Park Service in 1955. It received significant publicity {{as a result of the}} presidential visits.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{based on}} the example of Artvin Regional Directorate of Forestry, it is aimed to display the {{viewpoints}} of <b>forest</b> <b>administration</b> chief officers as regards planning who are {{the basic elements of}} interest groups and who implement plans, determine their opinions about the problems they encounter during preparation and application phases of plans, and develop solution proposals. Within this study a survey was performed with 31 <b>forest</b> <b>administration</b> chief officers in Artvin Regional Directorate of Forestry. According to the survey results, at planning phase it has been seen that participatory processes are put into force, certain criteria and indicators are adopted in differentiating between forest functions at inventory stage, which were also taken into consideration during planning, and in particularly stand parameters were determined accurately. Also during planning phase, it is believed that, endemic, rare and endangered targeted plant and wild animal species are evaluated, whereas non-wood forest types suffer from a lack of evaluation. In addition, it was concluded that lack or insufficiency of silviculture plans, the size of <b>forest</b> <b>administration</b> chiefdom and relations problems between <b>forest</b> <b>administration</b> and local people were being experienced. By integrating other interest groups to planning process, widening the scope of the sudty and realizing similar studies in different regional directorates of forestry, we can determine common points and differences and by this way new strategies can be developed...|$|R

40|$|The main {{interest}} {{of our research}} project lies at the interface between ambiguous organizational decision-making in regional <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> and contradictory, complex and uncertain knowledge concerning climate change adaptation. In our case study we focus on problem-solving performances related to a) the organizational response of an administration confronted with heterogeneous expectations and interests from its dynamic environments (external perspective) and b) long-term decision-making under uncertainty on the regional and local level (inside perspective). First, along with DiMaggio & Powell (1983), we assume that regional <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> absorb uncertainty by adopting solutions (e. g. working tools such as risk maps) from other <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> whose response, {{when faced with the}} same problem, is considered as legitimate within the forestry community (institutional isomorphism). Second, we presume that practical decision-making concerning climate change adaptation measures (e. g. tree species selection) is far from rational. Based on theoretical approaches such as behavioral decision theory and Karl Weick’s sensemaking concept (Weick 1995), state <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> are rather understood as interpretation systems that scan, interpret, and learn while acting in mutual dependencies with their environment. Based on qualitative (32 expert interviews with senior administrators) and quantitative (national online survey among district foresters) data, we argue that – instead of being considered a hurdle for long-term planning – the acceptance of indispensable uncertainty leads to an understanding of planning as a creative process, enabling a variety of solutions. 1...|$|R
