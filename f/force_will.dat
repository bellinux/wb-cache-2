5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a <b>force</b> <b>will</b> act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E

25|$|Objects may {{possess a}} {{property}} known as electric charge and an electric field exerts a force on charged objects. If the charged object {{has a positive}} charge the <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be {{in the direction of}} the electric field vector at that point while if the charge is negative the <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the force is given by the quantity of the charge multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field vector.|$|E

25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical <b>force</b> <b>will</b> occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|E
