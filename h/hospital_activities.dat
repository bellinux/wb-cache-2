As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification categorises health care as generally consisting of <b>hospital</b> <b>activities,</b> medical and dental practice activities, and [...] "other human health activities". The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates, or other allied health professions, e.g. {{in the field of}} optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, yoga therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homeopathy, chiropractics, acupuncture, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Leslie Boyer, Director of the VIPER Institute, {{who was on}} {{the team}} that {{developed}} CroFab, said they were [...] "crestfallen" [...] to discover that the wholesale price of Anascorp, their latest antivenom, was too high to be cost effective, even in the treatment of critically ill children. The industry website Fierce Pharma called the product a “drug launch disaster” and “one of the most bizarre marketing tales in the industry.” Boyer said that CroFab, a US drug whose sister product retailed in Mexico at $100, was resulting in bills to Arizona patients of between $7,900 and $39,652 per vial. One person rejected treatment and died because he couldn't afford to pay for it. Boyer collected data on the cost of production and marketing, and found that the largest true cost to payers, $4100/vial, was that of the legal, regulatory and <b>hospital</b> <b>activities</b> involved in selling the drug. Clinical trials contributed $300/vial, and 25% of that had been paid for by government grants. Other costs were the same as in Mexico.|$|E

50|$|The former Superintendent's Residence (now the Social Workers' Office) is {{important}} in demonstrating the practice of accommodating the medical superintendent on the Hospital site. The medical superintendent had resided on the hospital site since 1866. Constructed in 1941, this building replaced two earlier residences. Dr Aubrey Pye, medical superintendent from 1933 to 1967, was the first superintendent to occupy this residence. Pye exercised significant influence over {{the administration of the}} Hospital and oversaw major changes and expansion to all facets of the <b>Hospital</b> <b>activities.</b> Residential in scale and materials, the former residence belongs to a cohesive group of residential buildings in the centre of the Hospital site. The building was refurbished in 1966. It is no longer used as a residence and now accommodates offices. Situated to the east of the Lady Lamington Nurses' Home and between the now demolished resident medical officers' quarters and Ward 15, the building forms part of a well defined group of residential buildings in the centre of the Hospital complex. The building was skilfully designed and detailed in the Old English style by architects Conrad and Gargett. A two-storey building, the lower floor is constructed in cavity brickwork and the upper floor is stucco over a timber stud frame. The house has a tiled roof and a distinctive asymmetical front elevation to the east. The lower level contains living rooms and the upper floor contains bedrooms. Maids quarters are provided in a single storey semi-detached portion to the rear. There is a distinctive decorative bargeboard above a large bay window {{to the north of the}} arched entrance. The form and integrity of the place remain. The associated north lawn and planted gardens are part of the larger residential precinct of the Lady Lamington Nurses' Home, Lady Norm Wing, Edith Cavell Block and Ward 15.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the completeness {{and accuracy of}} data in a computerised clinical information system (Manchester orthopaedic database) {{in comparison with the}} data available through the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Activity</b> Analysis. DESIGN [...] Retrospective review of case notes, computer data, and <b>Hospital</b> <b>Activity</b> Analysis data. SETTING [...] Orthopaedic unit in a district general hospital in Manchester. SUBJECTS [...] 200 random patient records distributed through the period of use of the computer system (1 October 1988 to 31 March 1990) and 121 records for random admissions between 1 April 1989 and 31 March 1990, 71 of which were included in the previous sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Conformity of the computer record key words and <b>Hospital</b> <b>Activity</b> Analysis codes to an ideal key word record and ideal code record drawn up by one investigator from the clinical notes; overall quality (completeness times accuracy). RESULTS [...] Overall completeness of the data in the orthopaedic database was 62 % and the accuracy was 96 %. Completeness improved after feedback to doctors on the use of key words in regular audit meetings. Completeness was higher in inpatient than outpatient records (69. 9 % v 53. 7 %, p less than 0. 001) and when a new key word was required compared with missing and incorrect key words (both p less than 0. 001). Completeness was lower when the key word was required of a senior registrar (p less than 0. 05). Accuracy was not significantly different. The completeness of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Activity</b> Analysis data was 90. 5 % and accuracy 69. 5 %. Thus the overall data quality was similar in both systems. CONCLUSIONS [...] Even in a system designed for simple and efficient data capture, compliance by users was poor. Accuracy was high, suggesting that users understood the principles of data entry. Completeness of data capture can be improved by providing feedback to users on use of the system and performance. Improvements in future versions of the software should improve performance...|$|R
