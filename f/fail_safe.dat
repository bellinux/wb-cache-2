25|$|Passenger trains {{have had}} {{for a long time}} a 3-wire version of the {{electro-pneumatic}} brake, which gives seven levels of braking force. In most cases the system is not fail-safe, with the wires being energized in sequence to apply the brakes, but the conventional automatic air brake is also provided to act as a <b>fail</b> <b>safe,</b> and in most cases can be used independently {{in the event of a}} failure of the EP brakes.|$|E
25|$|Scuba diving {{implies the}} use of an {{autonomous}} breathing gas supply carried by the diver, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which provides the name for this mode of diving. Scuba may be the simpler and more popular open circuit configuration or one of the more complex and expensive closed or semi-closed rebreather arrangements. Rebreathers used for recreational diving are generally designed to require a minimum task loading on the diver and as far as possible to <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> and give the diver ample warning to bail out to open circuit and abort the dive.|$|E

If the cooling fails, say because of a power failure, the fan stops, the plug melts, and the fuel drains to a subcritical passively cooled storage facility. This not only stops the reactor, also the storage tank can more easily shed the decay heat from the short-lived radioactive decay of irradiated nuclear fuels. Even {{in the event of a}} major leak from the core such as a pipe breaking, the salt will spill onto the kitchen-sink-shaped room the reactor is in, which will drain the fuel salt by gravity into the passively cooled dump tank.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{the early}} efforts at {{fault-tolerant}} designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a {{method by which}} faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure. Later efforts showed that, to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing - isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic <b>fail</b> <b>safes</b> and a warning to the operator, {{and it is still}} {{the most common form of}} level one fault-tolerant design in use today.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{part of the}} PAL {{design is}} the {{inclusion}} of [...] "stronglinks" [...] and [...] "weaklinks." [...] These words, which come from the proverb [...] "a chain is only as strong as its weakest link", ensure resilience to accidental activation through damage. The stronglinks include the ruggedization of some components and inclusion of insensitive munitions {{so that they will}} not be circumvented by fire, vibration, or magnetic fields, leaving the PAL vulnerable to bypass after such damage. On the other hand, activation-critical electronics within the weapon, such as capacitors, are selected so that they will fail before the safety device in the event of damage, ensuring that the weapon <b>fails</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are <b>fail</b> <b>safe,</b> the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} look through the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before the day of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E
25|$|A {{manifolded}} {{twin set}} with isolation valve {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the isolation valve is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, but not when it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set in quite a short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not <b>fail</b> <b>safe.</b> If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|E

Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} British {{signal is}} the semaphore, comprising a mechanical arm that rises or drops to indicate 'clear' (termed an [...] "upper-quadrant" [...] or [...] "lower-quadrant" [...] signal, respectively). Both types are <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> {{in the event}} of breakage of the operating wire but lower-quadrant signals require a heavy counter-weight (usually {{in the form of the}} [...] "spectacle" [...] that carries the coloured lenses for use at night) to do that, while upper-quadrant signals return to [...] "danger" [...] under the weight of the arm.|$|E
2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E

40|$|SAFe is a {{framework}} that applies both agile and lean practices for developing software. The current trend is that increasingly more organizations develop their software in a globally distributed setting.

Therefore, this research investigates the application of SAFe in globally distributed settings. Five problems are discovered that {{can be expected to}} <b>fail</b> when <b>SAFe</b> is applied in distributed settings: incorrect execution of SAFe, language barriers, time zone differences, increased communication effort, and inefficient communication tools.
