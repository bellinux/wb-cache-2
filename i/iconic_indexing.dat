40|$|Spatial {{relationships}} are important issues for similarity-based retrieval in many image database applications. With {{the popularity of}} digital cameras and the related image pro-cessing software, a sequence of images are often rotated or flipped. That is, those images are transformed in the rotation orientation or the reflection direction. However, many <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing</b> strategies based on symbolic projection are sensitive to rotation or reflec-tion. Therefore, these strategies may miss the qualified images, when the query is issued in the orientation different from {{the orientation of the}} database images. To solve this problem, some researchers proposed a function to map the spatial relationship to its transformed one. However, this mapping consists of several conditional statements, which is time-consuming. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing</b> strategy, in which we carefully assign a unique bit pattern to each spatial relationship and record the spatial information based on the bit patterns in a matrix. Without generating the rotated or flipped image, we can directly derive the index of the rotated or flipped image from the index of the original one by bit operations and matrix manipulation. In our performance study, we analyze the time complexity of our proposed strategy and show the efficiency of our proposed strategy according to the simulation results. Moreover, we implement a prototype to validate our proposed strategy.

40|$|We propose an <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing</b> {{of images}} {{to be exposed}} on the Web. This should be {{accomplished}} by “Keypics”, i. e. auxiliary, simplified pictures referring to the geometrical and/or the semantic content of the indexed image. Keypics should not be rigidly standardized; they should be left free to evolve, to express nuances and to stress details. A mathematical tool for dealing with such freedom, in the retrieval task, already exists: Size Functions. An experiment on 494 Keypics with Size Functions based on three measuring functions (distances, projections and jumps) and their combination is presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the virtual image, an <b>iconic</b> <b>index</b> suited for pictorial information access in a pictorial database, and a similarity retrieval approach based on virtual images to perform content-based retrieval. A virtual image represents the spatial {{information contained in}} a real image in explicit form {{by means of a}} set of spatial relations.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} is {{discussed}} to store and retrieve images efficiently from an image database {{on the basis}} of the data structure called E() representation. The E() representation is a spatial knowledge representation preserving the spatial information between objects embedded in symbolic images as an <b>iconic</b> <b>index</b> for the purpose of efficient image retrieval. The image retrieval method is invariant under, at least, the affine transformation (i. e. translation, rotation and scale) and is able to deal with substantial object occlusion. A metric is defined to express similarity between symbolic images. Initial experiments carried out for two applications show that the image retrieval method is very efficient and robust to similarity retrieval in image databases. Together with the inherent high parallelism, it makes the method a promising image retrieval method. keywords: image database, image indexing, similarity retrieval, spatial relations, E() representation, metric, spatial quer [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Each image cluster has a {{representing}} iconic image. SIFT features [29] of all belonging images {{within the}} cluster are grouped into a Bag-of-Visual-Word (BoVW) vector. Such augmented BoVW vector {{is used as}} the feature representation of the iconic images. <b>Iconic</b> images are <b>indexed</b> in a vocabulary tree [30] for fast retrieval. For each new image I, a small set of iconic images (2 in our case) is retrieved using vocabulary trees. Geometric verification is performed between the unseen image I and every retrieved iconic image. Based on the registration results, different actions are taken: (1) if the new image I fails to register to any retrieved iconic images, it will form its own new cluster with itself being the iconic image; (2) if I registers to multiple iconic images, the registered clusters are merged together as a connected component; and (3) if the new image registers to only one iconic image, image I is added to that cluster.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} very general {{approach}} to indexing and retrieval of images in image database systems. We allow different ways of indexing and matching for objects in an image, and integrate them with our existing approach of the generalized extended pseudo- 2 D string and generalized combined 2 D string representation of the image to formulate a more general framework for <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing</b> and retrieval of images. Image retrieval is then discussed, and the query processing of image retrieval consists of both matching of objects and matching of spatial relationships. This suggestion for general-purpose image database systems is particularly suitable for building huge, heterogeneous and distributed image databases. 1. Introduction. Imag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the completeness problem of reasoning about planar spatial relationships in pictorial retrieval systems. We define a large class of two-dimensional scenes, the extended pseudo-symbolic pictures. The existing rule system R is proved to be complete for (extended) pseudo-symbolic pictures. We also introduce a new <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing,</b> the (extended) pseudo- 2 D string representation, for them. The (extended) pseudo- 2 D string has the good properties of the 2 D string. It is unambiguous, like the augmented 2 D string, and has a compact form suitable for image retrieval. We then present efficient algorithms {{to determine whether a}} given planar picture is (extended) pseudo-symbolic or not, and if it is, these algorithms also return its (extended) pseudo- 2 D string representation. Picture retrieval by (extended) pseudo- 2 D strings is also discussed. 1. Introduction. Imag...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two different subjects: {{on the one}} hand the interrelations of narrative prose fiction and narrative fiction film, on the other hand fictional narration and intermediality as such. The first part discusses the concepts of medium and intermediality, and presents some general theoretical models. Of special importance is the three level structure of fictional representations: sign vehicle, meaning and fictional content. The second part focuses on the qualities of the sign vehicle, and on different kinds of meaning and fictional content. The sign vehicle of language and literature is digital, and consists of replicas of types. The film medium is analogue, the cinematic sign is a copy. The conventionality of literary fictions is primary, i. e. literary meaning depends on the conventions of language. The conventionality of film narratives is secondary, mediated by non-conventional meaning. The second part also deals with specific, general, generic, concrete and abstract meaning, and discusses the concepts of metaphor, symbol and expression. Part three focuses on <b>iconic</b> and <b>index</b> relations, i. e. relations of similarity and contiguity, of the fictional representation. Cinematic narratives are characterized by primary iconicity, i. e. all meaning and fictional content are dependent on the iconic relation between the poles of the representation. The iconicity of prose fiction is, by contrast, secondary, mediated by conventional sign relations. Also abductive and performative, fictional and non-fictional indexical signs, and different kinds of implications and lacunas are discussed. Part four deals with the concepts of fictionality and narrative perspective, such as the fictional stance, the narrator and focalization. Four different notions of fictionality are scrutinized and brought together, and narrative perspective is described and analyzed in terms of two different game fictions: epic games and perceptual games. Depending on the semiotic resources, the possibilities and limits of prose fiction and fiction film described in the first three parts of the dissertation, fictional games are shown to be more or less rich and realistic...|$|R

In our approach, we extract relative-metric information from symbolic pictures and use such information to help establish indexes based on an improvement from a minimal perfect hashing scheme. As a result, more accurate picture retrieval can be achieved through our indexing mechanism. Capabilities in spatial reasoning and query representation/processing are also improved. By utilizing relative-metric spatial relations, an image database system becomes more flexible and intelligent. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Spatial {{relationships}} between objects are important features for designing a content-based image retrieval system. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, called 9 D-SPA representation, for encoding the spatial relations in an image. With this representation, important functions of intelligent image database {{systems such as}} visualization, browsing, spatial reasoning, <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing,</b> and similarity retrieval can be easily achieved. The capability of discriminating images based on 9 D-SPA representation is much more powerful than any spatial representation method based on Minimum Bounding Rectangles or centroids of objects. The similarity measures using 9 D-SPA representation provide {{a wide range of}} fuzzy matching capability in similarity retrieval to meet different user’s requirements. Experimental results showed that our system is very effective in terms of recall and precision. In addition, the 9 D-SPA representation can be incorporated into a two-level index structure to help reduce the search space of each query processing. The experimental results also demonstrated that, on average, only 0. 1254 percent 1. 6829 percent of symbolic pictures (depending on various degrees of similarity) were accessed per query in an image database containing 50, 000 symbolic pictures.

40|$|In this paper, a video query model {{based on}} the content of video and <b>iconic</b> <b>indexing</b> is proposed. We extend the notion of {{two-dimensional}} strings to three-dimensional strings (3 D-Strings) for representing the spatial and temporal relationships among the symbols in both a video and a video query. The problem of video query processing is then transformed into a problem of three-dimensional pattern matching. To efficiently match the 3 D-Strings, a data structure called 3 D-List and its related algorithms are proposed. In this approach, the symbols of a video in the video database are retrieved from the video index and organized as a 3 D-List according to the 3 D-String of the video query. The related algorithms are then applied on the 3 D-List to determine whether this video is an answer to the video query. Based on this approach, we have started a project called Vega. In this project, we have implemented a user friendly interface for specifying video queries, a video index tool for constructing the video index, and a video query processor {{based on the}} notion of 3 D-List. Some experiments are also performed to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. 1...|$|E
