40|$|SUMMARY Finding {{intracranial}} aneurysms plays a {{key role}} in preventing serious cerebral diseases such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. For detection of aneurysms, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can provide detailed images of arteries non-invasively. However, because over 100 MRA images per subject are required to cover the entire cerebrum, image diagnosis using MRA is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. This article presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for finding aneurysms with MRA images. The principal components are identification of aneurysm candidates (= ROIs; regions of interest) from MRA images and estimation of a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>degree</b> for each aneurysm candidate based on a case-based reasoning (CBR). The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>degree</b> indicates whether a candidate is true aneurysm. Our system presents users with a limited number of ROIs that have been sorted in order of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>degree.</b> Thus, this system can decrease the time and the labor required for detecting aneurysms. Experimental results using phantoms indicate that the system can detect all aneurysms at branches of arteries and all saccular aneurysms produced by dilation of a straight artery in 1 direction perpendicular to the principal axis. In a clinical evaluation, performance in finding aneurysms and estimating the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>degree</b> was examined by applying the system to 16 subjects with a total of 19 aneurysms. The experimental results indicate that this CAD system detected all aneurysms except a fusiform aneurysm, and gave high fuzzy degrees and high priorities for the detected aneurysms. key words: intracranial aneurysm, magnetic resonance angiography, casebased reasoning, computer-aided diagnosis, fuzzy logic 1...|$|E

This paper proposes an extended fuzzy description logic that supports the comparisons of <b>fuzzy</b> membership <b>degrees</b> and the concept constructors from description logic ALCN (attributive concept description language with complements and number restriction), written FCALCN (fuzzy comparable ALCN). FCALCN introduces new forms of atom concepts in order to support the comparisons between <b>fuzzy</b> membership <b>degrees.</b> A reasoning algorithm for FCALCN is proposed, and the complexity of the reasoning problems of FCALCN with empty TBox is proved to be PSpace-complete.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new software product FuzzME. It was {{developed as a}} tool for creating fuzzy models of multiple-criteria evaluation and decision making. The type of evaluations employed in the fuzzy models fully corresponds with the paradigm of the fuzzy set theory; the evaluations express the (<b>fuzzy)</b> <b>degrees</b> of fulfillment of corresponding goals. The FuzzME software takes advantage of linguistic fuzzy modeling to the maximum extent. In the FuzzME software, both quantitative and qualitative criteria can be used. The basic structure of evaluation is described by a goals tree. Within the goals tree, aggregation of partial fuzzy evaluations is done either by one of fuzzified aggregation operators (fuzzy weighted average, ordered fuzzy weighted average) or by a fuzzy expert system. The paper contains an illustrative example of the software usage. The application concerns a soft-fact-rating problem that was solved in one of Austrian banks...|$|R

Here we instead interpret <b>fuzzy</b> <b>degrees</b> of preference to only apply where the preference over two alternatives is genuinely fuzzy and then suggest an aggregation procedure that minimizes a generalized Kemeny distance to the nearest complete or partial order. By focusing on the fuzzy partial order, the method is less affected by differences in the natural scale over which an expert expresses their preference, and can also limit the influence of extreme scores...|$|R
