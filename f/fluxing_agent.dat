Detection of fast flux networks continues to be a challenging issue because of the similar behavior between these networks and other legitimate infrastructures, such as CDNs and server farms.

The core mechanism of FF-Watch is based on the inherent feature of fast <b>flux</b> networks: <b>flux</b> <b>agents</b> within stub networks take the role of relaying client requests to point-of-sale websites of spam campaigns. The main idea of FF-Watch is to correlate incoming TCP connection requests to <b>flux</b> <b>agents</b> within a stub network with outgoing TCP connection requests from the same agents to the point-of-sale website.

The aim of the industrial experiments was to assess the possibility of achieving the optimum chemical composition of the slag that would improve the kinetic conditions of the refining ladle slag during the treatment in secondary metallurgy units. Industrial experiments were focused on comparing the influences of different slag-making agents such as lime (CaO), briquetted <b>fluxing</b> <b>agents</b> and deoxidation agents forming calcium carbide (CaC 2) and granular aluminium (Algranul). During the evaluation of the slag mode in the ladle, samples of the steel from different technological places under operational conditions were taken to assess the desulphurization degree. The samples of the slag for evaluating the chosen parameters, such as basicity, the content of easily reducible oxides, the proportion of CaO/Al 2 O 3 and the Mannesmann index, were taken too. Further, the temperature and the oxygen activity in the steel were continuously measured too. The results mentioned in this paper represent the basic information about the possibilities of the slag-mode optimisation in the ladle using different proportions of the slag-making additions, briquetted <b>fluxing</b> <b>agents</b> as well as the deoxidation agents within secondary metallurgy.

The use of self-reducing agglomerates for ferro-alloys production is becoming an emerging processing technology due to lowering the electric energy consumption and improving the metal recovery in comparison with traditional ones. The self-reducing pellets were composed by chromite, petroleum coke, cement and small (0. 1 % - 2 %) addition of ferro-silicon. The slag composition was adjusted by addition of <b>fluxing</b> <b>agents.</b> The reduction of pellets was carried out at 1773 K (1500 degrees C), 1823 K (1550 degrees C) and 1873 K (1600 degrees C) by using induction furnace. The products obtained, containing slag and metallic phases, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses (XEDS). By increasing temperature from 1773 K to 1823 K large effect on the reduction time was observed. It decreased from 30 minutes to 10 minutes, for reaching around 0. 98 reduction fraction. No significant effect on reduction time was observed when the reduction temperature was increased from 1823 K to 1873 K. At 1773 K, the addition of 2 % of ferro-silicon in the pellet resulted in an increasing reaction rate of around 6 times, in comparison with agglomerate without this addition.
