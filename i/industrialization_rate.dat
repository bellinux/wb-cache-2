40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} {{consists}} {{in the analysis of}} the articulation of the growth of the service sector with the current changes in the economic systems. The hypothesis which was our point of departure challenged traditional analyses of services that based themselves either on the positive or on the negative character of the growth of the services. In this hypothesis, the main factor was centred on the qualitative side. In this way in the first part (chapter I and II) we tried to interpret the contributions of the several currents of economic thought about the services and their growth, widening that interpretation into the field of sociology. One of the main results we got put into evidence the subordination to the industrialist concept of Economics, not individualizing services as an economic object with characteristics that differentiates it from goods. Therefore, in chapter III, we presented a concept of service recurring to the systemic analysis and we deduced the implications in what the measure is concerned, in particular, the productivity. On the basis of the concept of services and on the articulation between the changes in technological and socio-economic fields, we built in chapter IV the concept of tertiarization process, which means the growing appeal for services from economic systems as a response to new production and consumption conditions that may be observed both at macro and microeconomic levels. Finally in chapter V, we began a first approach of services in the Portuguese economy, through the analysis of the production of services inside the industrial system itself (<b>industrialization</b> <b>rate)</b> and the supply of services (mode of valorization) from the "business services" sector having concluded that the organizational structures of the Portuguese industrial firms are relatively stable.

The proposed BAG-SA algorithm not only inherits the simplicity and efficiency of the standard BA with a capability of searching for global optimality but also enhances local search ability and speeds up the global convergence rate. The BAG-SA algorithm is employed to optimize the coefficients of the multiple linear and quadratic forms of electricity demand estimation model. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm has higher precision and reliability than the coefficients optimized by other single-optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, or bat algorithm.

The thinking of the international financial institutions and free market economists is that, as in USA, the state should confine itself to regulation only and the operation and ownership of industrial enterprises and utilities {{should be left to}} the private sector. However, there is an opposite view expressed by a distinguished economic historian, Gershenkron, in his seminal article “Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective 1 ”.

Electricity {{availability}} and stability {{have a great}} contributory share of <b>industrialization</b> growth <b>rate,</b> poverty statistics, unemployment, foreign investors' participation, medium and small scale encouragement, crime and mortality rates recorded in any country. Nigeria as a country has been challenged with unstable and unreliable power supply. There are many problems associated with electricity production in Nigeria. Such problems are recorded in the generation, transmission and distribution facets of electricity production. With a multi-faceted problem, this document has been developed {{to deal with the}} economic aspect of power generation in Nigeria. Out of numerous technologies that are used in power generation, Nigerian predominantly sources its electricity supply from gas power plants and hydropower systems located within the country. Unfortunately, the Nigeria hydropower has been challenged with hydrological shortfalls. The gas power plant which is now conventional is being challenged with the developing gas technology around the globe. This development has adversely affected the cost of gas and subsequently the cost of power production using gas power plants. As a result of hydrological limitations on Nigerian hydropower dams, effect of gas price on cost of energy produced and diversifying gas technology, harnessing electric energy from Inga falls of River Congo was considered as an economic choice of power production in Nigeria. The choice of power production adopted in this document was made from an economic viability studies carried out between Nigerian gas power plants and hydropower production from the River Congo. The choice of technology employed for harnessing electric energy is largely dependent on the economic factors that go with the development. While some of these technologies go with large initial capital investment some are challenged with geometric increase of running cost. As applied in this work, the Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Levelized Cost of Energy and Cash Flow Trend Analysis are suitable tools to determine choice of power plant. These tools were integrated and developed as an NILC model. In the analysis presented in this dissertation, the economic viability of the two power plants selected was determined {{with the use of the}} Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Levelized Cost of Energy and Cash Flow Trend Analysis (NILC) model. The model was used to measure the economic viability quantities of the two power plants selected for economic comparison. After the completion of economic comparative analysis, hydropower production from the River Congo was concluded to be a better choice of power production compared to the conventional gas power plant option in Nigeria.

This research investigates how land conversion process to industrial zones and clusters affected to the way that different groups of peasant households accumulate their resources. The study was carried out in 3 districts of Hung Yen province from 2006 to 2010. The study results are as follows: first, the land conversion to industrialization has impact on not only the decline of household landholdings but also the changes value of land which are the sources of social conflicts and informal land transfer. Second, in the context of land conversion to industrialization with tiny plots of land, low return from agricultural production and more opportunities of non-farm activities, even when non-farm employment is very profitable, peasant households are not likely to give up their land but maintaining agricultural production for not only their basic and secure livelihood but also for their identity. Third, among the affected peasant groups, the households with non-farm background tend to be in better position in engaging to high - earning activities. They are likely the rich peasants in opposed to the poor group with farming background and lost more than 50 % of their agricultural land.

40|$|This econometric study {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate about {{the costs and benefits}} of urban form by employing interdisciplinary means—urban planning, econometrics and public administration—to explore the relationship between urban form and urban public services expenditure. In China, particularly, rapid urbanization is accompanied by an increase of urban public services expenditure and a difference in efficiency, which undermines the promotion of urban public service development. The Chinese government has paid great attention to urban sustainable development and promoting urban public services performance; however, until recently there has been a lack of empirical studies exploring the relationship between urban public services expenditure and urban form. Thus, the present research aims to analyze this issue by using relevant indicators based on an econometric model. The results provide a promising basis for improving urban public services expenditure efficiency. Based on the urban area interpreted by remote sensing data and geographic information system, two urban form metrics, the compactness ratio and the elongation ratio, are selected and quantified to describe urban compactness and urban sprawl accurately. Panel data analyses are performed using a cross-sectional dataset of the 30 cities for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 to assess the likelihood of association between indicators of urban form and urban public services expenditure, while controlling for other determinants, such as educational level, income per capita, degree of <b>industrialization,</b> and unemployment <b>rate.</b> The results indicate that urban elongation is positively correlated to per capita urban public services expenditure and urban compactness is insignificantly correlated to it. Thus, it is recommended that policymakers consider the relationship between urban form and public services expenditure as part of urban planning and on-going strategies to promote public service efficiency...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{tracks the}} dialectical development of liberal subjectivity from eighteenth-century cultures of sensibility {{to the development}} of pragmatist-feminism {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century. Scholars have recently developed models for understanding transatlantic circuits of exchange and their importance in the development of interiority. Secularizing Sentiment, in focusing on the shift from sensibility and sentiment to pragmatism and feminism, participates in these discussions by framing liberal discourse in terms of affective conflict and aesthetic innovation. In particular, it anatomizes the generative contradictions of liberal subjectivity, on the one hand enamored of the text's power to order experience, on the other terrified of the threat to selfhood posed by iteration. Secularizing Sentiment theorizes the shift from sentimentalism to pragmatist-feminism as transatlantic states struggle with economic liberalization, <b>industrialization,</b> and growing <b>rates</b> of literacy. It emphasizes literacy as a technology accompanied by predictable conflicts, providing new lines of inquiry across an expanding archive of print and material culture made available by digitization. Chapter One considers Bluestocking sociality and Della Cruscan poetics by way of Sarah Wilmot nee Morris, a presumably unpublished poet whose manuscript miscellanies I found while doing archival research at Chawton House Library. Chapters Two and Three, through close attention to transatlantic novels and poetry of sensibility and sentiment, characterize sentimental subjectivity in terms of manic literacy, referred to by Jacques Derrida as the pharmakon, and how manic literacy gives rise to regulatory hermeneutic regimes. These regimes of interpretation - such as sensibility, sentimentalism, realism, and pragmatism - check the free play of the text according to powerful social and institutional structures. Chapters Four and Five complicate my theorization of liberal subjectivity, considering how the Civil War and the rise of clinical discourse threaten sentimental presumptions. Chapter 6, through readings of John Dewey, Jane Addams, and William James, demonstrates how pragmatist-feminism emerges as a sentimental critique of clinical discourse, thus placing it in the broader genealogy of liberal subjectivity explicated in Chapters One through Five...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of entrepreneurship {{in a social}} structure results from the characteristics of entrepreneurs in determining {{the needs of a}} society and making investments in that area. Therefore, entrepreneurship {{is one of the most}} important factors of the progress for any social structure. On the entrepreneurship, the economics gives increasing importance to the characteristics of social structure. This situation has similar importance on the requirements of entrepreneurship. Two points should be considered in this context while analyzing entrepreneur behaviors. The first one is that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs works with which social perception. The second one is that whether entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs use social environment they are in with different social groups. Beginning the transitional period from the industrial society to knowledge society in the world, the view of small enterprises can ensure competition efficiency and harmonization in especially social production area has become common. Therefore, ?small and medium enterprises' (SME) are started to be seen as enterprises that can accommodate changing conditions and fill demand gaps in the society quickly because of their dynamic structures. The {{importance of}} SMEs that involve great flexibility and productivity together at the international scale increases gradually. Thus, every country creates its own SME. Accordingly, this subject should be considered in terms of social culture since the SME-society relation involves originality for every society. Existing SME literature deals with SMEs independently from cultural structures of societies and considers them under the dominant economic theory. Thus, a standard SME and entrepreneur model approaching to all SMEs in all societies of the world with the same point of view occurs. Within the scope of the study, Turkey's process of social change was separated into mainly three terms starting from 1960 when the <b>industrialization</b> and urbanization <b>rate</b> increased. The effects of social structure characteristics of the terms on entrepreneurship are discussed. The discussion analyzes the policies of 9 different national development plans prepared by the governments and tried to be implemented in the terms between the years of 1963 - 2013 called as planned period and started at the same years in Turkey. This presentation is aimed at described the reflection of these policies, which are tried to be evaluated with social, economic, and spatial dimensions, on the local entrepreneur and local production spaces...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1976. Bibliography: leaves 126 - 135. Microfiche. ix, 135 leaves illThis study {{analyzes}} {{the variation in}} labor force participation rates of several age-sex groups of the Thai population in 1970 {{in terms of an}} econometric model incorporating economic as well as demographic variables. The study is a cross-sectional one based mainly on census data for 71 provinces of Thailand. The econometric model incorporates eclectic theories of labor supply with human capital theory as well as economic/demographic theory. It consists of three structural equations and an identity equation reflecting the joint dependency among activity rates, wage rates, and family income. In the participation rate equation, age-sex specific activity rates are functions of wage rates, family income, unemployment <b>rates,</b> <b>industrialization,</b> education, population-density, and family size. Parameters of the model are estimated by two-stage least squares technique. The results of the statistical estimation are generally consistent with the underlying theoretical concepts. The participation rates of prime-age males were found less sensitive to socioeconomic variations compared to those of other groups of the population. The effect of the wage variable is positive and significant for females of every age group, but it was negative and not significant for males of every age group except the 20 - 29 age group (where it was negative and significant). The coefficients of the family income variable are negative and significant for females of all ages and young men (aged 11 - 19). The income effect is positive and significant for males aged 40 and above. Unemployment rates were found to have negative effects upon most workers except for young women aged 11 to 14 whose coefficient is insignificant statistically. In terms of elasticity participation rates are generally less sensitive to the unemployment rates than to family income and wage rates. Education has a relatively large positive effect on participation rates of the young of both sexes while it has a large negative effect on participation rates of women 40 to 59 years of age. A milder positive effect of education occurs in females aged 20 - 39. The coefficient of industrialization which captures the effects of difference in economic structure, rural-urban residence, and occupational composition among areas is positive for secondary workers. Family size is positively associated with participation rates of the young aged 11 - 19 and women aged 40 to 60 and above. Final 1 y population density was found negatively related to participation rates of secondary workers and positively related to participation rates of primary workers. In conclusion, this study can serve as a guide to the effects of various variables on different measures of labor supply. Provided the parameters of the model remained constant, a planner could use the model to test the effects of various manpower policies of labor supply if he could deduce how a policy change would affect the variables in the model...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 İş sağlığı ve güvenliği kavramı çalışanların, işletmenin ve üretimin her türlü tehlikelerden korunması ve risklerin öngörülmesi, değerlendirilmesi, bu risklerin ortadan kaldırılması amacı ile ortaya çıkmıştır. Ancak bu üç faktörde tam olarak iş güvenliği sağlanırsa çalışanların güvenliği sağlanmaktadır. Bu nedenle devlete, işverenlere ve çalışanlara büyük görevler düşmektedir. Yapılan işin özelliğine ve kapsamına göre işyerleri çevre, sağlık ve güvenlik açısından çeşitli tehlikelerle karşı karşıyadır. Artan sanayileşme, üretimin hızlanması, tüketime cevap verebilme telaşı vb. sebeplerle çalışanların maruz kaldıkları iş kazası ve meslek hastalıklarında çok ciddi artışlar olmaktadır. Ulusal mevzuatlar konunun önemine vurgu yapmış ve birçok ülke mevzuatında İSG ile ilgili düzenlemelerin yer almasını sağlamıştır. Hem Dünya’da hem de Türkiye’de sağlık ve güvenlik tehlikelerinden ve bunların yarattığı risklerden arındırılmış çalışma ortamlarının sağlanması bilinci etkin bir biçimde artmaya başlamıştır. Kaza olmadan önlemeye çalışmak, tedbirler almak doğacak olumsuz sonuçları da en aza indirmektedir. Birçok insan zamanının önemli bir kısmını işyerinde geçirmektedir. Bu nedenle işyerleri çalışanlara uygun olarak düzenlenmelidir. Çalışma ortamlarının düzeni sağlanamaması beraberinde birçok sorunu da getirir. İşyeri düzensizliği, çalışanların malzeme arama ile vakit kaybetmelerine, eksik ya da fazla hammadde siparişlerinin verilmesine, fabrika alanının verimsiz kullanılmasına ve iş kazalarının meydana gelmesine neden olur. Tesisler, tertip, düzen ve temizliği sağlarken, maliyetlerini azaltabilir, verimliliklerini arttırabilir, kayıp ve israfı azaltabilir bu sayede iş güvenliği ve motivasyonu geliştirebilirler. 5 S sistematiği çalışma alanının temiz ve düzenli tutulmasını sağlar. Bu kapsamda işyerini {{organize}} ve standardize eder. 5 S sistematiği tesislerde iş güvenliğine, prosese, ürün kalitesine, stok yönetimine ve çalışılan alanın kontrolüne önemli katkılar sağlar. Bu çalışmada, doğalgaz sayaç üretimi yapan bir tesiste 6331 sayılı İş Sağlığı ve Güvenliği Kanunu ve bu kanuna göre çıkartılmış olan tüm yönetmelikler göz önüne alınarak yapılan iş sağlığı ve güvenliği faaliyetleri konu alınmıştır. Tüm tesis için yapılan risk değerlendirmesinde Fine Kinney metodu kullanılmıştır. Risk değerlendirmesi 5 S sistematiği uygulanmadan önce yapılmıştır. Daha sonra 5 S sistematiği uygulanmıştır. Çalışmanın amacı, 5 S sistematiğinin risk değerlerine olumlu etkilerini göstermektir. Sadece 5 S sistematiği ile sayaç üretim hattındaki birçok risk değeri düşürülmüştür. Ayrıca tüm tesisin risk değerlendirmesi yapılmış risk değerlendirmesinde tüm tesis, ortak alanlar ve sayaç üretim hattında belirlenen ancak 5 S uygulaması ile çözülemeyen tehlikeler, kaynakları, riskleri, risk değerleri ve nasıl önleneceği verilmiştirThe Occupational Health and Safety {{have come}} out for protect the operation, employees and production {{from all kinds of}} hazards. The occupational health and safety main goal is prediction evaluation and elimination of risks. The workplaces are faced with variety of hazards in environment, health and safety. The occupational accident and occupational diseases are seriously increasing due to rapidly growing <b>industrialization,</b> production <b>rate,</b> flurry of response to the consumption, etc. It has emphasized the importance of this issue led to the inclusion of national legislation and regulations relating to occupational health and safety in many countries. Due to the fact that occupational accident is the most important problem in work life all over the world. The awareness of creating work environment without health and security hazards and risks that they may be occur is start to growing effectively in both World and Turkey. The negative results would be minimum with trying to avoid the accident and taking precautions. Due to these reasons, an important tasks fall to government, employers and employees. The occupational accident and diseases rates are increasing day by day. Occupational accidents and occupational diseases in the facilities have required taking legal precautions. Importance of risk assessment becomes even more important because of increasing awareness of occupational health safety and some legal enforcements. In Turkey, Occupational Safety and Health law No. 6331 was come out in the Official Gazette on June 30 in 2012. The law includes some important points such as to prevent workers from accidents, to protect the health of workers from occupational diseases and to layout of the workplace. The most important point in this law is about risk assessment. According to law, risk assessment implications are required in all businesses and facilities. By applying risk assessment in the facilities occupational accidents and diseases can be reduced minimum. People are required to comply with the rule of law in concept of occupational health and safety. Despite this legislation aiming to prevent work accidents have been introduced in facilities, there is a noticeable {{decrease in the number of}} occupational accidents and disease. Companies have to use the right risk assessment technique. Thus, the goal is more easily attainable. Occupational accidents and diseases can be reduced and preventable. Legal regulations force facilities to complete their risk assessments considering their danger class in certain time periods. Process changes, new machines and new legislations are forcing facilities to do their risk assessments before its due time. The aim of risk assessment is to describe preparations, precaution and checks which will be able to respond to hazards in facilities. The internal and external physical condition of the workplace is one of the most important factors that affect the job security. Many people spend essential part of time in their workplace. Therefore, workplaces should be regulated according to the employees. The lack of organization of the workplace brings a lot of problems. Messy workplace cause wasting time with searching materials, ordering more or less raw material, and using factory area unproductive and occurance of occupational accidents. Facilities can reduce the cost, increase the productivity, reduce the losses and waste and develop the motivation of occupational health and safety with creating neater, more ordinate and cleaner working area. 5 S systematic is a systematic approach for making clean, neat working area properly, organize and standardized workplace. 5 S systematic in facilities, contribute to occupational safety, process, product quality, inventory management and increasing the control efficiency of working area. The 5 S systematic is a basic approach that works in companies all over the world. 5 S systematic consists of five steps. These are sorting, set in order, shine, standardize and sustain. Sort means that removal of all equipments from the workplace that are not needed for production. Thus, irregularity is eliminated. Set in order means that you arranging the items and equipment. Shine is removing dust from the work area and machines. Thus, both employees health and machine can be prevented. Standardize and sustain are used for going on these three steps and keep improving workplace organization. In this study, a comprehensive research has made at the company which produce natural-gas meter in terms of occupational health and safety and also environmental according to the Occupational Health and Safety law no. 6331 and all regulations accordingly with this law. The method of Fine Kinney has used while doing risk assessment. The 5 S systematic which implemented in the facility is shown to how risk assessment impressed since before and after. The main goal of this thesis is to show the positive impressions of the 5 S systematic for risk assessment. The evaluation was done in the facility by using a control list. The list consists of many questions about occupational health and safety. Thus, the status of facility was detected in terms of occupational health and safety. Risk assessment was done for the production line of natural gas meter. Process specific hazards were identified before 5 S systematic not implemented. First hazards and their sources, their risks and risk scores were detected in risk assessment. While these scores were determining, Fine Kinney method was established. Frequency and intensity values were determined by using some charts in Fine Kinney method. These three value was multiplied with each other and the risk values were obtained. In the natural gas meter production line, there are more than one hazard with the same risk point. Thus, hazards were put in a list from highest value to lowest value. 5 S systematic was implemented in the facility. All employees in natural gas meter production department were educated about 5 S methodology. 5 S systematic implementation started from the sorting step. Necessary and unnecessary materials have been identified. Useless materials removed from the work area. Due to the fact that unnecessary materials and equipment can cause various problems after a period of time. Also, materials in the wrong places were put on the right places. 5 S systematic implementation continue with the set in order step in the natural gas meter production department. All materials organized according to their usages areas. Thus materials and equipment needed can be found in a short time and easily. Shine is one the most important step in the facilities. Due to the fact that cleaning is useful both employees and machine and equipment. Facilities can use clean equipment long term. In this way, lost time for maintenance and repair can reduced. Occupational accident reports of the last three years in the facilities show 28 accident occurred and 22 of the counter of the natural gas meter production process. These accident results are Minor scrapes, cuts, and bruising. Materials from the assembly line they had moved into the basket or cardboard box material with the shape as a result of improper handling during transport handshake event has occurred. During maintenance disassembly of the substance splashes to the eye when cutting plastic parts with side cutter counter parts in the section have occurred. In natural gas meter production line 13 hazard sources were identifed in the risk assessment. From these 13 hazard sources cauese 17 hazard. Before starting implementation of 5 S systematic in the facility, in risk assessment 13 very high risk, 3 high risk and 1 susbstantial risk were identified. Then, 5 S systematic was implemented. First three steps of 5 S systematşc were applied to the natural gas meter production line. After implementation of 5 S systematic while calculating risk values, the values of probablity and frequency decreased owing to positive effects of 5 S systematic. According to this stuation, in risk assessment 3 very high risk, 7 high risk and 7 substatial risk were identified. The values of 5 S systematic before and after show that the positive effects of 5 S systematic in the facilities. Only sorting, set in order and shine steps faclities can reduce the risk values easily. Due to the fact that tidiness, many risk can be prevented. Risk values are reduced and hazards are prevented without any cost. Cleaner and safer working areas bring safety. When a work area is clean and organized thazards sources and other dangers are eliminated. Employees like to work in a well-organized and clean work areas. People feel better about their work environment. Also, risk assesment was done for entire facility before 5 S systematic implementation. In this risk assessment consist of all facilities, common areas and natural gas meter production line. Some hazards cannot be solved with the application of 5 S systematic. In this risk assessment hazards resources, hazards, risks and how to prevent risk are examined and explained. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
