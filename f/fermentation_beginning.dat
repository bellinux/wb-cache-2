40|$|Aim: This work {{is aimed}} {{to study the}} {{effectiveness}} of the use of bentonite at different stages of the vinification process (pilot and industrial scales) in relation to wine protein stability. The effect of wine storage and ageing on protein content and stability is also studied. Methods and results : The experimental trials were made with a Macabeu wine (vintage 2011) and included the following treatments : bentonite addition to must only, bentonite addition during <b>fermentation</b> (<b>beginning,</b> middle and end), and no treatment (control). The results show no effect of scale in fermentation kinetics. At both scales, the wines treated with bentonite during fermentation had lower total protein concentrations as compared to the control wines (10 - 17 %) and the wines obtained from must treated with bentonite (7 - 14 %), which were the most unstable. Conclusion : This study shows that the fermenter size (industrial and pilot scale) has no significant effects on alcoholic fermentation, indicating that, from a practical point of view, pilot-scale fermentations satisfactorily reproduce those performed at industrial scale. Moreover, all the wines treated with bentonite during fermentation present a lower protein concentration and a higher stability. Significance and impact of the study : The results obtained in pilot-scale fermentations are representative of industrialscale fermentations and therefore can be used reliably to study protein stability and stabilization in white wines...|$|E

50|$|Liquid brem is {{made from}} {{fermented}} mash of black/ white glutinous rice (known as Ketan) using a dry-starter called Ragi tape. Glutinous rice is soaked and drained, steamed for 1 hour, and then cooled down. The cooled rice is then inoculated with Ragi tape and amylolysis begins. A honey-like rice syrup settles {{in the bottom of}} the malting vessel. Following 3 days of conversion from rice starch to sugar, a yeast culture is added and alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> <b>begins.</b> Alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> typically goes on for two weeks.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>fermentation</b> <b>begins</b> in {{the same}} way as any wine, {{converting}} the natural sugar in the grapes into alcohol while the resultant carbon dioxide is allowed to escape.

50|$|Hawaiians {{discovered}} {{that if the}} ti root is baked, a sweet liquid migrates {{to the surface of}} the root. Chemically, the heat changes the starch in the root to a fermentable sugar.

50|$|Today, sorting and de-stemming {{are common}} {{techniques}} in Bordeaux {{and have been}} for some time. Great efforts {{have been made to}} improve these processes. Technology has also affected the crushing of the grapes, which had been done by treading since ancient times.

Today, some châteaux, such as Château Smith-Haut-Lafitte, do not crush the grapes at all, letting the <b>fermentation</b> <b>begin</b> within each grape (a process widely used in the Beaujolais region).|$|R

5000|$|As soon as {{the grapes}} arrive at the winery, they are sorted and destemmed. After destemming, the grapes are then delicately pressed, just to break the skins, and this must be {{immediately}} transferred to temperature-controlled, stainless-steel vats that hold between 1,585 and 3,170 gallons. These specialized vats are divided into two separate tanks stacked {{on top of one}} another.

5000|$|Yeast, {{the most}} common one being S. cerevisiae, is used in baking as a {{leavening}} agent, where it converts the food/fermentable sugars present in dough into the gas carbon dioxide. This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air pockets [...] "set", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts used in baking are {{of the same species}} common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, Saccharomyces exiguus (also known as S. minor), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted, <b>fermentation</b> <b>begins,</b> producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this evaporates during baking.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} a 6 -day storage period on changes in pH, acid-binding capacity, level of organic acids and ethanol of three liquid coproducts [liquid wheat starch (LWS), mashed potato steam peel (PSP) and cheese whey (CW) ] and two liquid {{compound}} diets [liquid grower diet (LGD) and liquid finisher diet (LFD) ] were studied. All products, except LWS, showed {{a significant decrease in}} pH and acid-binding capacity during storage. At the end of the storage period, all products reached a pH of between 3. 5 and 3. 9. In general, it can be concluded that the lactic acid content, {{and to a lesser extent}} the acetic acid content, increased dramatically during storage. In contrast, the ethanol content increased significantly in the liquid compound diets only. The pattern of changes in pH and organic acids during the 6 -day storage period was different between the liquid coproducts and the liquid compound diets. At the start of storage, liquid coproducts are already in the 'middle' of the fermentation process, while liquid compound diets need approximately 24 - 36 h before <b>fermentation</b> <b>begins.</b> Consequently, in practice a different approach to obtain fermented diets is needed for liquid coproducts and liquid compound diets...|$|R

50|$|Alcohol has {{a higher}} {{refractive}} index (1.361) than water (1.333). As a consequence, a refractometer measurement made on a sugar solution once <b>fermentation</b> has <b>begun</b> {{will result in a}} reading substantially higher than the actual solids content. Thus, an operator must be certain that the sample he is testing has not begun to ferment. Brix or Plato measurements based on specific gravity are also affected by fermentation, but in the opposite direction; as ethanol is less dense than water, an ethanol/sugar/water solution gives a Brix or Plato reading which is artificially low.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fermentation</b> <b>begins</b> {{as soon as}} yeast {{is added}} to the cooled wort. This is also {{the point at which the}} product is first called beer. It is during this stage that {{fermentable}} sugars won from the malt (maltose, maltotriose, glucose, fructose and sucrose) are metabolized into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation tanks come in many shapes and sizes, from enormous cylindroconical vessels that can look like storage silos, to five-gallon glass carboys used by homebrewers. Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels (CCVs), which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's aperture is typically around 70°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow smoothly out through the cone's apex at the end of fermentation, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out through a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, making it easy to harvest top-fermenting yeasts. The open tops of the vessels increase the risk of contamination, but proper cleaning procedures help to control the risk.|$|R
