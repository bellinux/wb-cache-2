However, until recently, sensitivity analysis has seen only limited application in the area of decision theory and support. This paper investigates the use of sensitivity analysis in the realm of classical Bayesian reasoning, where the probabilities of the states of nature are revised based on additional information. These updated probabilities only become useful, however, if they lead to an optimal decision different from that obtained on the basis of prior probabilities.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the global, variance-based, sen-sitivity {{analysis}} {{is used to}} quantify the impact of measure-ment imperfections on voltage sag based fault location. This kind of fault location requires voltage phasor infor-mation from meters to be compared to simulated cases in order to locate faults. However, meters are prone to mea-surement imperfections. It is therefore critical {{that the impact of}} measurement imperfections, such as measure-ment and loading errors, are fully assessed to account for uncertainty in algorithm <b>inputs.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis was used to attribute responsibility for uncertainty in fault location to uncertainty in the inputs of the fault location algorithm. The results demonstrate that the single most detrimental factor to precise fault location is large fault resistance, both alone and in combination with other fac-tors.
