50|$|Only one Koach {{was made}} for the {{television}} series and feature film. It was made from three Ford Model T bodies and is 18 feet long. The 133-inch frame was made by hand, as were the brass radiator and fenders. It has blood red interior and black pearl paint. It took 500 hours to hand form the ornate rolled steel scrollwork. The front end had a dropped <b>axle,</b> split <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and T springs. Its design featured a custom hearse body.|$|R
500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson Stabilator dampers front and rear, with a tubular beam <b>axle</b> at the <b>front</b> and a live <b>axle</b> and <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and rear tracks were both [...] wide. Center-locking wire wheels with 5" [...] x 33" [...] tires were used front and rear.|$|R

50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> and rear. The <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are located by <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by trailing arms and Watt's linkage.|$|R
5000|$|Sydney Allard soon saw the {{potential}} of the economically more vibrant - but sports car starved - US market and developed a special competition model to tap it, the J2. The new roadster was a potent combination of a lightweight, hand-formed aluminium body fitted with independent front suspension and de Dion type rear axle, inboard rear brakes, and designed for a Ford [...] "flathead" [...] V8. Allard's distinctive front suspension was produced by splitting the I-beam <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in two to make swing <b>axles,</b> with long <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and a new feature, for their day, of inclined telescopic shock absorbers. Importing American engines just to ship them back across the Atlantic proved problematic, so US-bound Allards were soon shipped engineless and fitted out in the States variously with newer overhead valve engines by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, and Oldsmobile. In that form, the J2 proved a highly competitive international race car for 1950, most frequently powered by 331-cubic-inch Cadillac engines. Domestic versions for England came equipped with Ford or Mercury flatheads. Russian-American engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov, formerly of Ardun (named after founders Yura and Zora ARkus-DUNtov) where he designed and developed aluminium overhead valve hemi heads for flathead Fords, worked for Allard from 1950 to 1952 and raced for the factory Allard team at Le Mans in 1952 and 1953.|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, {{to compete}} with Mercedes Benz and Auto Union, Enzo Ferrari (Race team manager) and Luigi Bazzi (Designer) built a racer with two 3.2 (3.165-litre) engines, one {{in the front and}} one in the rear, giving 6.3litres and [...] The {{drivetrain}} layout was unusual. The two engines were connected by separate driveshaft to a gearbox with two input shafts, and two angled output shafts, so each of the rear wheels had its own driveshaft. It could never quite succeed against the Mercedes W25 B of Rudolf Caracciola, and was hard on fuel and tyres. The gain in speed was offset by increased pit times. On May 12, 1935, two were entered in the Tripoli Grand Prix driven by Nuvolari and Chiron who finished fourth and fifth. Chiron managed a second at the following 1935 Avus race. On June 16, 1935 Nuvolari drove a specially prepared Bimotore from Florence to Livorno and set a new speed record [...] with an average speed of over [...] After that it was sidelined in favour of the Tipo C. It was the first racer to use the Dubonnet independent trailing arm front suspension. The V12 was under development, but was not race ready. It was noticed that the Bimotore had a traction advantage on rough ground, so a version of the Bimotore chassis with the independent Dubonnet front end, and a new independent rear with swing <b>axles</b> with <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and a transverse leaf spring was used for the Tipo C 3.8s.|$|R
50|$|Bettenhausen {{was killed}} in 1961 in a crash at Indianapolis while testing a Stearly Motor Freight Special vehicle for Paul Russo. The car smashed into the outside wall of the track and then rolled 325 feet along the barrier. The car came to rest in a grassy plot between the wall and Grandstand A, with {{the tail of the}} car on fire. Results showed the {{accident}} was caused by an anchor bolt which fell off the front <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> support, allowing the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> to twist and misalign the front wheels when the brakes were applied, which drove the car into the wall.|$|R
50|$|<b>Front</b> steer-drive <b>axles</b> (including the 2nd axle on 8x8/10x10 chassis) are sprung by a {{combination}} of parabolic leaf springs with progressively acting rubber assistors and hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers. Rear axles are sprung by inverted multi-leaf trapezoidal springs with <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> and an anti-roll bar. A conventional rear bogie set-up is employed for 6×6 and 8×8 chassis. The HX45M 10×10 features hydropneumatic suspension for the rear three axles.|$|R
50|$|In general, Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has over a Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is better gross axle weight ratings.|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed the [...] "Tinley Park Express," [...] Tony Bettenhausen, Sr. {{was killed}} in a crash during a {{practice}} run on May 12. He was testing a car for Paul Russo. It was determined that an anchor bolt fell off the front <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> support, permitting the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> to twist and mis-align the front wheels when the brakes were applied. The car plunged into the outside wall, then rode along the top, snapping fence poles and tearing segments of the catch fence. The car came to rest upside-down on top of the outside wall, and Bettenhausen {{was killed in}}stantly. Before the time trials Bettenhausen had been the favorite to become the first driver to break the 150 mph barrier at the Speedway.|$|R
50|$|The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{reduces the}} turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam. Traction is enhanced in certain conditions without need for extra ballast.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was {{suspended}} from the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> at just one point by a pivoted transverse leaf spring which made no contribution to transverse stability and the whole car rested on just three points. <b>Radius</b> <b>rods</b> from the gearbox take up braking strains and act as distance stays for the back <b>axle.</b> The <b>front</b> end of these stays have buffer springs The foot brake is the contracting band type, the hand brake is of the pull-on internal expanding type. Both sets of brake are metal to metal. The action of the engine brake avoids much use of the conventional braking system. The rear springs attach {{by means of a}} spherical case clipping over a spherical turned part of the axle casing thus allowing a little motion due to bumps.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{was used}} in 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> started out with 23 spline axle shafts {{and then went to}} 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue failure {{has become}} a major concern in the {{automobile}} and aircraft industry, heavy machinery etc. Failures by fatigue are especially dangerous because they are unpredictable; giving no prior notification of the imminent failure they occur suddenly. <b>Front</b> <b>axle</b> of tractor {{is one of the major}} and very important components that undergo severe load conditions and it fails unexpectedly causes unrecoverable losses. The objective of this study is to analyze the existing design of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> of the tractor for service load conditions and redesign to its functional requirements and to increase its life expectations. Finite element simulation is carried out for the existing <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> using ANSYS. The critical location of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has to be identified and redesigned to ensure the safety. The existing geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified to the optimum size which suits for functional requirements with increased life and minimum cost. In this analysis, the geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified and a new design is proposed. The life expectancy of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was predicted for the dynamic load using ANSYS fatigue design module...|$|R

50|$|Historically, this {{designation}} {{was used}} {{regardless of whether}} the entire engine was behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> line. In recent times, the manufactures of some cars have added to the designation with the term front-mid which describes a car where the engine is in front of the passenger compartment but behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> Most pre-World War II front engine cars would qualify as front-mid engine, using the front-mid designation, or on the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and full-scale finite element analysis of the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> emergenc...|$|R
