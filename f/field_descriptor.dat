The views are obtained by first identifying salient points via a learning approach that uses shape characteristics of the 3 D points [4, 3]. The salient views are selected by choosing views with multiple salient points on the silhouette of the object. Silhouette-based similarity measures from [6] are then used to calculate the similarity between two 3 D objects.

40|$|The {{heliostat}} field of solar central receiver systems (SCRS) is formed by hundreds, even thousands, of working heliostats. Their adequate configuration and control define a currently active research line. For instance, automatic aiming methodologies of existing {{heliostat field}}s are being widely studied. In general, control techniques require {{a model of}} the system to be controlled in order to obtain an estimation of its states. However, this kind of information may not be available or may be hard to obtain for every plant to be studied. In this work, an innovative methodology for data-based analytical heliostat field characterization is proposed and described. It formalizes {{the way in which the}} behavior of a whole field can be derived from the study of its more descriptive parts. By successfully applying this procedure, the instantaneous behavior of a field could be expressed by a reduced set of expressions that can be seen as a <b>field</b> <b>descriptor.</b> It is not intended to replace real experimentation but to enhance researchersâ€™ autonomy to build their own reliable and portable synthetic datasets at preliminary stages of their work. The methodology proposed in this paper is successfully applied to a virtual field. Only 30 heliostats out of 541 were studied to characterize the whole field. For the validation set, the average difference in power between the flux maps directly fitted from the measured information and the estimated ones is only of 0. 67 % (just 0. 10946 kW/m 2 of root-mean-square error, on average, between them). According to these results, a consistent <b>field</b> <b>descriptor</b> can be built by applying the proposed methodology, which is hence ready for use...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{evaluate}} a systematic approach for improving performance of 3 D model retrieval by combining multiple shape descriptors. We explored two approaches for generating multiple, mutually independent, shape descriptors; (1) {{application of a}} (single-resolution) shape descriptor {{on a set of}} multiresolution shape models generated from a query 3 D shape model, and (2) application of multiple, heterogeneous shape descriptors on the query 3 D shape model. The shape descriptors are integrated via the linear combination of the distance values they produce, using either fixed or adaptive weights. Our experiment showed that both multiresolution and heterogeneous sets of shape descriptors are effective in improving retrieval performance. For example, by using the multiresolution approach, the R-precision of the SPRH shape descriptor by Wahl, et al, improved by 8 %, from 29 % to 37 %. A combination of three heterogeneous shape descriptors achieved the R-precision of about 42 %; this figure is about 5 % better than the R-precision of 38 % achieved by the Light <b>Field</b> <b>Descriptor</b> by Chen, et al., which is arguably the best single shape descriptor reported to date...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) model {{retrieval}} {{has gathered}} great importance in recent years, since {{the number of}} available 3 D models on the Internet has drastically increased. Many content-based 3 D model retrieval approaches have been proposed. Among these methods, visual similarity-based methods have shown higher retrieval accuracy. However, because these methods capture enormous shape features from diÂ®erent viewpoints or locations, {{a large amount of}} calculation and comparison is necessary. Furthermore, there is a trade-o Â® between retrieval accuracy and speed. In this paper, a 3 D model retrieval method constituting Continuous Principal Com-ponent Analysis (CPCA), Fourier descriptors, and Zernike moments is proposed. CPCA is applied to extract signiÂ¯cant shape features based on projecting the model along the principal axes. Then, Fourier descriptors and Zernike moments are used to provide shape descriptors with rotation invariants. In addition, a feature integration process combines them. A strategy of similarity measure is proposed to solve the axes switching problem.

QSAR modeling resulted in identification of common structural features responsible for prediction of apoptosis-inducing activity for 4 -anilinoquinozaline derivatives. 2 D-QSAR studies revealed that AI descriptors were major contributing descriptors.

The overall degree of prediction was found to be around 82 % in case of MLR and PLS. Among the three 2 D-QSAR models (MLR, PCR, and PLS), results of PLS analysis showed significant predictive power and reliability as compare to other two methods. The master grid obtained for the various kNN-MFA models showed positive value in electrostatic <b>field</b> <b>descriptors,</b> which indicates that positive electronic potential is required to increase apoptosis-inducing activity.

Assfalg's soccer highlight system [10] used a discrete 3 -state left-to-right HMM model for each highlight type, noting that the three states correspond well to the evolution of the highlights in terms of characteristic content. The features used were a framing term (whether very long shot, long shot, or medium long shot); pan and tilt quantised in 5 and 2 levels. Three extra features to reflect player position were also investigated.

The approach that led to reporting this period was based on Fourier method of spectral analysis.

Besides geology and paleontology, virtually all science and engineering disciplines could benefit from the approach described here.

The major challenges related to this task are to specify the notion of similarity and define respective pattern descriptors.

40|$|Shape-based {{similarity}} and matching of 3 D models {{has been an}} area of active research {{in the past decade}} in disciplines such as computer vision, computer graphics, mechanical engineering, molecular biology, and chemistry. Advances in robust algorithms for geometry-based representations and shape matching algorithms have enabled comparison of objects on both global shape as well as local shape. While past research has focused on developing meaningful shape representations, there is limited literature on benchmarking various shape representations, and developing automatic indexing and clustering techniques, especially for the mechanical engineering domain. Indexing techniques such as multi-dimensional R-trees have been used for indexing 3 D models [1], however they are not readily applicable to more recently developed shape representations such as skeletal graphs and other view-based representations, including Light <b>Field</b> <b>Descriptors</b> (LFD) [2], and Multiple Levels of Detail (MLD) representations [3] which showed superior retrieval performance compared to several other methods. These shape representations are embedded in arbitrary metric spaces, rather than in feature space, thereby rendering traditional indexing and clustering algorithms unsuitable in this context. ^ In this thesis we have proposed using a multidimensional scaling strategy to convert the data from arbitrary metric spaces to lower dimensional feature spaces which can be easily handled by existing indexing and clustering techniques. We have evaluated several different shape descriptors with respect to shape retrieval and automatic clustering. Evaluations were performed on two different benchmark datasets - an Engineering Shape Benchmark (ESB) and the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB). Additionally, we evaluated the retrieval performance of these representations on two smaller datasets from the National Design Repository. Results from both these experiments suggest that the new view-based shape representations can be used for clustering and indexing large databases.
