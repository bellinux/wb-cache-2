5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper <b>floodlighting,</b> so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{rebuilding}} of the venue took place {{ahead of the}} 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides. On the south side, a wave-shaped roof was built; originally designed to be self-supporting, the contractor, Reinertsen, did not trust their own calculations and made a last-minute decision to install support columns. The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. <b>Floodlighting</b> was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches {{to be held at}} the venue. An all-weather running track was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a short walk to the stadium. In 1994, the first pitch with Desso GrassMaster was laid.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install <b>floodlighting</b> at Briskeby.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst {{the general public}} and politicians. The chief of administration had doubted whether he should recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut costs, a <b>floodlighting</b> system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also a concern that very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Floodlit</b> (day/night) Cricket is cricket played under <b>floodlights</b> at night.

Since then most test playing countries have installed <b>floodlights</b> in {{some or all of}} their stadiums. Traditional Cricket <b>floodlights</b> have a long pole on which lights are fixed. This is done because several times, the ball travels too high when a batsman hits it and high lights are needed to keep the ball in sight. However, many cricket stadiums have different types of <b>floodlights</b> like the ANZ Stadium in Australia. The DSC Cricket Stadium in Dubai recently installed Ring of Fire system of <b>floodlights</b> which is latest and smartest system of <b>floodlight</b> in the world.|$|R

The {{purpose-built}} stadium was redeveloped {{a number of}} times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent <b>floodlighting</b> installed. Following the Taylor report, The Dell was converted to an all-seater stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in England's top-flight, precipitating a move to a new home. Prior to The Dell, the club's home grounds were the Antelope Ground, from 1887 to 1896, and the County Cricket Ground, from 1896 to 1898.|$|E

25|$|Given all {{required}} {{funding and}} development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, {{the first five}} Chain Home (CH) systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal <b>floodlighting</b> the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watt's own radio direction finders to determine {{the direction of the}} returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies.|$|E

A <b>floodlight</b> of angle ff is a light that projects in a (contiguous) cone of angle at most ff. A <b>floodlight</b> placed in a simple polygon with its apex at a vertex, aimed entirely interior to the polygon, is called a vertex floodlight; if it has angle at most ff, we will call it a vertex ff-light. We restrict each vertex to anchoring at most one <b>floodlight.</b> The question of illuminating a polygon with vertex <b>floodlights</b> was first explored in [3], in which it was established that every orthogonal polygon [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{transmitter}} {{system on the}} Mk. I produced 3microsecond (µs) long pulses with up to 50kW of power 1,500 times a second. These were broadcast semi-directionally, <b>floodlighting</b> the entire area {{in front of the}} transmitter antenna's current bearing. Since the signal was even less directional vertically than horizontally, a significant amount of the signal hit the ground. Due to the long wavelengths used, this signal was strongly reflected forward, and due to geometrical considerations, any signal hitting the ground near the station would reflect with enough of a vertical angle to mix with the main signal in the area of interest (about 30km around the station). This was the purpose of the GL mat, which did not eliminate the reflections, but made them much more predictable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of Tuesday 18 September 1956, a fire gutted the West Stand and {{scorched}} large sections of the pitch. The blaze consumed the entire structure, including offices, kit, club records, physiotherapy equipment, dressing rooms, directors' rooms, the press box and the generators for the <b>floodlighting</b> system. The roof of the stand collapsed into the seating area before the fire brigade arrived and the total damage was estimated to be £100,000, but the club's insurance cover was inadequate. The players helped clear rubble and wreckage but the 2,500-seater stand could not be salvaged. After a board meeting, the directors decided to launch a public appeal to build a new stand with assistance from Leeds City Council. The appeal raised £60,000 and a £180,000 West Stand was opened {{at the start of the}} following season.|$|E

His first victory was achieved at the fifth attempt in October 1996, when they defeated Belarus at the Kadriorg Stadium in a 1998 World Cup qualifier with a goal from Hohlov-Simson. After the victory over the Belarusians, the Estonian team gained infamy on 9 October 1996, when a match against Scotland had to be rescheduled after the Estonian team failed to turn up for the game. For unclear reasons, the match was rescheduled to be played on neutral ground in Monaco after it was agreed at a FIFA meeting in Scotland on 7 November, leading to the rescheduled match to take place on 11 February 1997 ending in a 0–0 draw. Reasons for the original postponement of the game was that the Scottish team trained at the Kadriorg the night before, finding the <b>floodlighting</b> inadequate. This matter was raised with the officials who agreed with their concerns. In protest, the Estonians failed to show up, which kicked off only to be stopped seconds later.|$|E
