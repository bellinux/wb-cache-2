2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} restenosis due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. [...] Restenosis is the body's response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. [...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, plain old balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. [...] Abbott Laboratories has used a <b>dissolvable</b> material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{availability of}} emerging non-combusted tobacco products (snus, <b>dissolvables,</b> and electronic nicotine delivery systems or ENDS) may {{have implications for}} pregnant women and women of reproductive age. We conducted 15 focus groups to explore how women perceive emerging non-combusted tobacco products and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in general, and during pregnancy. Sessions were held in 2013 in four U. S. cities. Participants were 18 – 40 years old and were pregnant smokers, pregnant quitters, or smokers planning a pregnancy. Responses were coded and analyzed to identify key themes using NVivo 10. 0 qualitative software (QSR). Several themes emerged from focus groups. Participants generally found snus unappealing, but viewed <b>dissolvables</b> as a discreet and stigma-free way to use tobacco during pregnancy. Participants perceived NRT as ineffective and having undesired side effects. ENDS were thought to offer advantages over cigarettes, including use in smoke-free areas, lower cost, appealing flavors, and fewer health effects, and were seen {{by some as a}} potential quit aid. Some participants, however, worried that the lack of natural stopping point could lead to excessive use. Many participants felt that the use of any tobacco or NRT product is harmful during pregnancy. Women seeking to reduce health risks or stigma related to smoking during pregnancy may perceive advantages of using some emerging products over cigarettes. These findings can inform future public health efforts to reduce risks associated with tobacco product use among women of reproductive age...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVEWe {{examined}} screening {{practices and}} attitudes of obstetricians-gynecologists toward the use of noncombustible tobacco products (chewing tobacco, snuff/snus, electronic cigarettes, and <b>dissolvables)</b> during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGNThe authors mailed a survey in 2012 to 1024 members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, including Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network (CARN) and non-CARN members. Stratified random selection was used to generate CARN and non-CARN samples. RESULTSResponse rates were 52 % and 31 % for CARN and non-CARN members, respectively. Of 252 total eligible respondents (those currently providing obstetrics care) 53 % reported screening pregnant women at intake for noncombustible tobacco product use all {{or some of the}} time, and 40 % reported none of the time. Respondents who reported that noncombustible products have adverse health effects during pregnancy, but are safer than cigarettes, ranged from 20. 2 % (<b>dissolvables)</b> to 29 % (electronic cigarettes) and that the health effects are the same as those of cigarettes from 13. 5 % (electronic cigarettes) to 53. 6 % (chewing tobacco). Approximately 14 % reported that electronic cigarettes have no adverse health effects; < 1 % reported no health effects for the remaining products. Two-thirds of the respondents {{wanted to know more about}} the potential health effects of noncombustible tobacco products; only 5 % believed themselves to be fully informed. CONCLUSIONA large proportion of obstetrician-gynecologists reported never or inconsistently screening their pregnant patients for the use of noncombustible tobacco products. Responses regarding the harms of these products relative to cigarettes were mixed and most respondents wanted more information. Development and dissemination of guidance for providers is needed to improve decision-making regarding noncombustible tobacco products.

60|$|As Gravity {{makes the}} Sea flow round the denser and weightier Parts of the Globe of the Earth, so the Attraction {{may make the}} watry Acid flow round the denser and {{compacter}} Particles of Earth for composing the Particles of Salt. For otherwise the Acid would not do the Office of a Medium between the Earth and common Water, for making Salts <b>dissolvable</b> in the Water; nor would Salt of Tartar readily draw off the Acid from dissolved Metals, nor Metals the Acid from Mercury. Now, as in the great Globe of the Earth and Sea, the densest Bodies by their Gravity sink down in Water, and always endeavour to go towards the Center of the Globe; so in Particles of Salt, the densest Matter may always endeavour to approach the Center of the Particle: So that a Particle of Salt may be compared to a Chaos; being dense, hard, dry, and earthy in the Center; and rare, soft, moist, and watry in the Circumference. And hence {{it seems to be}} that Salts are of a lasting Nature, being scarce destroy'd, unless by drawing away their watry Parts by violence, or by letting them soak into the Pores of the central Earth by a gentle Heat in Putrefaction, until the Earth be dissolved by the Water, and separated into smaller Particles, which by reason of their Smallness make the rotten Compound appear of a black Colour. Hence also it may be, that the Parts of Animals and Vegetables preserve their several Forms, and assimilate their Nourishment; the soft and moist Nourishment easily changing its Texture by a gentle Heat and Motion, till it becomes like the dense, hard, dry, and durable Earth in the Center of each Particle. But when the Nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central Earth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the Motion ends in Confusion, Putrefaction, and Death.|$|E
60|$|We {{have been}} so long habituated {{to a kind of}} local {{independence}} in the management of our affairs, and the central government has fortunately had so little occasion for making itself felt at home and in the domestic concerns of the States, that the idea of its relation to us as a power, except for protection from without, has gradually become vague and alien to our ordinary habits of thought. We have so long heard the principle admitted, and seen it acted on with advantage to the general weal, that the people are sovereign in their own affairs, that we must recover our presence of mind before we see the fallacy of the assumption, that the people, or a bare majority of them, in a single State, can exercise their right of sovereignty as against the will of the nation legitimately expressed. When such a contingency arises, it is for a moment difficult to get rid of our habitual associations, and to feel that we are not a mere partnership, <b>dissolvable</b> whether by mutual consent or on the demand of one or more of its members, but a nation, which can never abdicate its right, and can never surrender it while virtue enough is left in the people to make it worth retaining. It would seem to be the will of God that from time to time the manhood of nations, like that of individuals, should be tried by great dangers or by great opportunities. If the manhood be there, it makes the great opportunity out of the great danger; if it be not there, then the great danger out of the great opportunity. The occasion is offered us now of trying whether a conscious nationality and a timely concentration of the popular will for its maintenance be possible in a democracy, or whether it is only despotisms that are capable of the sudden and selfish energy of protecting themselves from destruction.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{potential}} for emerging tobacco products (ETPs) to be gateway products for further tobacco use among youth is of significant concern. PurposeTo examine use of various nicotine-containing products on a tobacco-free college campus {{and whether the}} first product tried predicts subsequent tobacco use. MethodsUndergraduate students (N= 1, 304) at a large university completed an online survey of past/current use of cigarettes; smokeless tobacco (SLT); hookah; ETPs (<b>dissolvables,</b> snus, and electronic cigarettes); and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Data were collected from September 2012 to May 2013 and analyses were conducted from June to September 2013. Students were classified as single, dual, or poly tobacco users. ResultsThe sample consisted of 79. 5 % non-users, 13. 8 % single, 4. 4 % dual, and 1. 5 % poly users. Overall, 49. 4 % of participants reported trying a tobacco product. Hookah was the most tried product (38 %), but cigarettes were most often the first product ever tried (51 %). First product tried did not predict current tobacco use and non-use, but individuals who first tried SLT or cigarettes (rather than hookah or ETPs) {{were more likely to}} be poly tobacco users. Current tobacco users who first tried ETPs or hookah were largely non-daily users of hookah; current tobacco users who first tried cigarettes or SLT were largely non-daily or daily users of cigarettes/SLT. ConclusionsHookah and ETPs are increasingly becoming the first tobacco product ever tried by youth; however, uptake of ETPs is poor, unlike cigarettes and SLT, and does not appear to lead to significant daily/non-daily use of cigarettes and SLT...|$|R
