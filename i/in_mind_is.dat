More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback to keep <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E

25|$|Another recent {{development}} in revolver {{technology is the}} Rhino, a revolver introduced by Italian manufacturer Chiappa in 2009 and first sold in the U.S. in 2010. The Rhino, built with the U.S. concealed carry market <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>is</b> designed so that the bullet fires from the bottom chamber of the cylinder instead of the top chamber as in standard revolvers. This is intended to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster and more accurate repeat shots. In addition, the cylinder cross-section is hexagonal instead of circular, further reducing the weapon's profile.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism {{sees the}} {{experience}} of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life because the quality of one's mind {{at the time of}} death is believed to condition one's future rebirth. The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the Bardo Thodol is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.|$|E
25|$|In Jelling, Thorfinn meets some of Thorkell’s men. After being {{pressured}} by the men, Thorfinn {{has no choice}} but to accompany them to meet Thorkell, the Earl of Jelling whose land was received by King Canute. Thorfinn also meets Floki who, unbeknownst to Thorfinn, was the one who ordered Askeladd to kill his father Thors. During their meeting, Thorfinn learns that a group of Jomsvikings led by Vagn is pirating the Baltic Sea to gain fame and name himself as the new chieftain of the Jomsvikings, as the previous chieftain died before he could name a successor. Floki came to Jelling to seek aid from Thorkell in the conflict. Floki cannot become the new chieftain as their order’s code dictates that any warriors 50 years and over must retire, and the candidate Floki has <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> too young for the order to admit. The candidate is Baldr, Floki’s grandson, as well the son of the former chieftain and grandchild of Sigvaldi, the second Jomsviking chieftain. In case a successor was not named, it’s only appropriate that the next chieftain is based on the prestige of his bloodline. To Floki’s dismay, Thorkell wants Thorfinn to become the next chieftain, as he is also the grandson of Sigvaldi and the son of Thors, the “Troll of Jom”, and currently the strongest and most valid candidate as the next Jomsviking chieftain. Thorfinn refuses the offer and returns to his companions. Thorfinn, knowing the dangers of staying in Jelling, hurries his crew to set sail immediately. All the while, Floki has plans to killing Thorsfinn while away from Thorkell’s lands.|$|E

2500|$|The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is {{one among}} those who are elaborating a secular {{conception}} of natural law in the liberal tradition. Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard argues that [...] "the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus." [...] Ludwig von Mises states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R.A. Gonce argues that [...] "the reality of the argument constituting his system overwhelms his denial." [...] Murray Rothbard, however, says that Gonce makes a lot of errors and distortions in the analysis of Mises's works, including making confusions about the term which Mises uses to refer to scientific laws, [...] "laws of nature", saying it characterizes Mises as a natural law philosopher. David Gordon notes, [...] "When most people speak of natural law, what they have <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> the contention that morality can be derived from human nature. If human beings are rational animals of such-and-such a sort, then the moral virtues are...(filling in the blanks is the difficult part)." ...|$|E
