Two durum lines which were near-isogenic for sensitivity to daylength were used throughout the study. The average day and night temperatures and daylengths for the Yuma, Arizona area during the period November to May and for the Santa Ana, California area from August through November were simulated in the growth chambers. Light for the night interruption was provided by incandescent lamps. Various intensities of light were tested and different durations of night interruption were applied. The night interruptions were initiated approximately one month after planting. From the studies it was learned that the date of harvest could be hastened 30 days by the use of incandescent lighting on the plants. To induce heading and hasten the harvest date by 30 days through the use of night interruption the following conditions had to be met: 1. The light intensity had to be at least 6 <b>foot</b> <b>candle.</b> 2. A night interruption of 6 <b>foot</b> <b>candle</b> intensity requires 5 hours of light (9 : 30 p. m. - 2 : 30 a. m.) each night. 3.

40|$|Nocturnal {{behavior}} of non-bloodfed females of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus was studied using an automatic recording device {{equipped with a}} photoelectric sensor. Carbon dioxide, heating, and the contrast of {{the black and white}} colors were used as attractive cues for mosquitoes. The nocturnal host seeking activity positively correlated with the increasing light intensity in both species. Ae. aegypti was found to be more sensitive to light than Ae. albopictus. The threshold of light intensity for the activation of the nocturnal host seeking activity was 10 lx (ca. 1 <b>foot</b> <b>candle)</b> in Ae. albopictus, respectively. Complete darkness during the daytime deactivated the host seeking activity of both species, irrespective of their increasing flight activity controlled by their intrinsic circadian rhythms. This suggested that visual cues are indispensable for host seeking behavior. The eye parameter value, the product of the ommatidial diameter, and the interommatidial angle were significantly larger in Ae. aegypti than those in Ae. albopictus, indicating that the eye of Ae. aegypti is more adapted to a darker environment. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博（医）乙第 1, 782 号 学位授与年月日:平成 19 年 10 月 31...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 An {{important}} cultural tool in {{the greenhouse}} production of tree seedlings in the Pacific Northwest is the control of photoperiod. By artificially lengthening the period of daily exposure to light, {{it is possible to}} increase both the magnitude and duration of seedling growth. By shortening the photoperiod, one can induce dormancy and hasten the development of frost hardiness, A variety of supplemental lighting and light blocking techniques are currently used in the production of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings. However, there is little information on the relative advantages of alternative lighting and light blocking schemes in terms of biological benefits or production costs. Three experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the effects of a variety of photoperiodic regimes on controlling the growth, dormancy and frost hardiness of seedlings of these two species. The objectives of these experiments were to determine the following: 1) the minimum light intensity, of an eight-hour period of supplemental light, capable of delaying dormancy and increasing the vegetative growth of newly germinated seedlings in the fall; 2) the effects of a variety of nighttime lighting treatments on maintaining seedlings in an actively growing condition in the early spring; and 3) the effects of varying daylengths and varying intensities of light leakage on the development of frost hardiness of seedlings in the late summer and early fall. In all three experiments there were pronounced differences between the responses of Douglas-fir seedlings and those of ponderosa pine seedlings. For Douglas-fir seedlings, an eight-hour period of supplemental lighting delayed dormancy and increased both stem elongation and dry weight when the intensity of the light provided was ten or more foot candles. Intensities of one <b>foot</b> <b>candle</b> or less did not cause any increase in the magnitude or duration of seedling growth. A variety of nighttime lighting regimes, including several intermittent lighting treatments, a two-hour night break, and 16 - and 22 -hour photoperiods, successfully extended the period of active growth of newly germinated winter-sown seedlings. Finally, shortening the photoperiod in the late summer and early fall substantially increased the frost hardiness of seedlings, but relatively low intensities of light leakage reduced seedling hardiness. For ponderosa pine seedlings, there was no obvious threshold supplemental light intensity above which dormancy was delayed and below which it was induced. Ten foot candles or more resulted in an increase in height growth, but there was no consistent relationship between light intensity and dry weight, bud set or basal diameter. For pine seedlings in the second experiment, growth was greatest for those exposed to only a natural photoperiod. Lastly, shortening the photoperiod in the late summer and early fall resulted in a general decrease in the level of frost hardiness developed in ponderosa pine seedlings. These results suggest that the control of photoperiod can be a highly effective tool for regulating the annual growth cycle of Douglas-fir seedlings, but is relatively ineffective for ponderosa pine seedlings...|$|E

40|$|The main role of roadway {{lighting}} {{is to produce}} quick, accurate and comfortable visibility during nighttime conditions. It is commonly known that good lighting levels enable motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists to obtain necessary visual information in an effective and efficient manner. Many previous studies also proved that roadway lighting minimizes the likelihood of crashes by providing better visibility for roadway users. Appropriate and adequate roadway lighting illuminance levels for each roadway classification and pedestrian areas are essential to provide safe and comfortable usage. These levels are usually provided by national, or local standards and guidelines. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Plan Preparation Manual recommends a roadway lighting illuminance level average standard of 1. 0 horizontal <b>foot</b> <b>candle</b> (fc) for all the roadway segments used in this research. The FDOT Plan Preparation Manual also states that this value should be considered standard, but should be increased if necessary to maintain an acceptable uniformity illuminance ratio. This study aimed to find the relationship between nighttime crash injury severity and roadway lighting illuminance. To accomplish this, the research team analyzed crash data and roadway lighting illuminance measured in roadway segments within the West Central Florida Region. An Ordered Probit Model was developed to {{understand the relationship between}} roadway lighting illuminance levels and crash injury severity. Additionally, a Negative Binomial Model was used to determine which roadway lighting illuminance levels can be more beneficial in reducing the counts of crashes resulting in injuries. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using longitudinal studies with and without roadway lighting. Results showed that on the same roadways there was a significant {{decrease in the number of}} nighttime crashes with the presence of roadway lighting. In this research, roadway lighting illuminance was measured every 40 feet using an Advanced Lighting Measurement System (ALMS) on a total of 245 centerline miles of roadway segments within the West Central Florida Region. The data were mapped and then analyzed using the existing mile post. During the process of crash data analysis, it was observed that rear-end collisions were the most common first harmful event observed in all crashes, regardless of the lighting conditions. Meanwhile, the average injury severity for all crashes, was found to be possible injury regardless of the lighting conditions (day, dark, dusk, and dawn). Finally, this research presented an Ordered Probit Model, developed to understand the existing relationship between roadway lighting illuminance levels and injury severity within the West Central Florida Region. It was observed that having a roadway lighting average moving illuminance range between 0. 4 to 0. 6 foot candles (fc) was more likely to have a positive effect in reducing the probability of injury severity during a nighttime crash. A Negative Binomial Model was conducted to determine if the roadway lighting average moving illuminance level, found on the Ordered Probit Model was beneficial in reducing crash injury severity during nighttime, would also be beneficial in reducing the counts of crashes resulting in injuries. It was observed that a roadway lighting average moving illuminance, range between 0. 4 to 0. 6 fc, was more likely to reduce the count of crashes resulting in injuries during nighttime conditions, thus increasing roadway safety. It was also observed that other factors such as pavement condition, site location (intersection or no intersection), number of lanes, and traffic volume can affect the severity and counts of nighttime crashes. The results of this study suggest that simply adding more roadway lighting does not make the roadway safer. The fact is that a reduction in the amount of roadway lighting illuminance can produce savings in energy consumption and help the environment by reducing light pollution. Moreover, these results show that designing roadway lighting systems go beyond the initial design process, it also requires continuous maintenance. Furthermore, regulations for new developments and the introduction of additional lighting sources near roadway facilities (that are not created with the intent of being used for roadway users) need to be created...|$|E

Standard procedures were used for chemical analyses and paper chromatography; moisture conditions during germination were controlled over gradients of sulfuric acid, while light intensities and temperatures were maintained in standard growth chambers. Seed were collected in paper bags and stored both in shelters {{in the field and}} in the laboratory refrigerator. Viability determinations were made with one percent triphenyltetrazolium chloride or three percent hydrogen peroxide whereas the criterion for seed germination was radicle emergence. Western dwarfmistletoe seed, after expulsion in the fall, remain dormant for approximately six months. Preliminary investigations suggested dormancy is regulated by a chemical inhibitor associated with the endocarp. Initial seed viability varied from one infected stand to another, whereas retention of viability was correlated with temperature. Seed stored at 1. 5 °C retained initial viability levels for 10 months; after 10 months seed began to significantly deteriorate. In some cases, however, viability was observed after a prolonged storage period of 48 months. Western dwarfmistletoe seed germinate over a temperature range from 1. 5 to 31 °C. The optimum constant temperature lies between 15 and 20 °C, whereas various combinations of alternating night-day temperatures revealed a combination of 5 to 15 °C to be most favorable for germination. Absorption of liquid moisture is essential for germination and germination readily occurs at reduced levels of aeralion. Germination also occurs in total darkness; however, light intensities between 200 and 1000 <b>foot</b> <b>candles</b> in conjunction with favorable temperatures significantly enhance germination. Increases in photoperiod up to 24 hours progressively increased germination percentages. Red light was slightly more effective in seed germination than far-red light.

Products were then placed under lighted storage for eight additional days (100 <b>foot</b> <b>candles,</b> 34 °F) to simulate retail display conditions. Ground sirloin had higher percent surface metmyoglobin (darkness and brown color) than ground pork shoulder after eight days of lighted storage. Lipid oxidation (rancidity) was higher in ground pork shoulder than ground pork sirloin. Pork shoulder had higher a* (redness) values than pork sirloin in both atmospheres. Microbial loads (aerobic microorganisms) were higher in product stored eight days versus two days; however, total aerobic microbial loads did not exceed 106 (the level commonly used to indicate microbial spoilage) for product stored in either atmosphere. Carbon dioxide successfully extends product shelf-life up to eight days under lighted storage conditions...|$|R
