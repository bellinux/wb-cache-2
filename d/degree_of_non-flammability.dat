40|$|A {{simplified}} and bounding {{methodology for}} analyzing the pressure buildup and hydrogen concentration within an unvented 2 R container was developed (the 2 R is a sealed container within a 6 M package). The specific case studied was the gas buildup due to alpha {{radiolysis of water}} moisture sorbed on small quantities (less than 20 Ci per package) of plutonium oxide. Analytical solutions for gas pressure buildup and hydrogen concentration within the unvented 2 R container were developed. Key results indicated that internal pressure buildup would not be significant {{for a wide range}} of conditions. Hydrogen concentrations should also be minimal but are difficult to quantify due to a large variation/uncertainty in model parameters. Additional assurance <b>of</b> <b>non-flammability</b> can be obtained by the use of an inert backfill gas in the 2 R container...|$|R
40|$|Past {{work has}} clearly {{demonstrated}} that numerous commonly used metallic materials will support burning in oxygen, especially at higher pressures. An approach to rectify this significant safety {{problem has been}} successfully developed and implemented by applying the concept <b>of</b> Situational <b>Non-Flammability.</b> This approach essentially removes or breaks one leg of the conceptual fire triangle, a tool commonly used to define the three things that are required to support burning; a fuel, an ignition source and an oxidizer. Since an oxidiser is always present in an oxygen system as are ignition sources, the concept <b>of</b> Situational <b>Non-Flammability</b> essentially removes the fuel leg of the fire triangle by only utilising materials that will not burn at the maximum pressure, for example, that the control valve {{is to be used}} in. The utilisation of this approach has lead {{to the development of a}} range of oxygen components that are practically unable to burn while in service at their design pressure thus providing an unparalleled level of first safety while not compromising on the performance or endurance required in the function of these components. This paper describes the concept <b>of</b> Situational <b>Non-Flammability,</b> how it was used to theoretically evaluate designs of components for oxygen service and the outcomes of the actual development, fabrication and finally utilisation of these components in real oxygen systems in a range of flow control devices...|$|R

40|$|An {{elementary}} psychophysical {{model to}} predict ride comfort was developed using flight and simulator data where subjects {{were exposed to}} six <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom.

In order to verify this concept of comfort modeling, it was necessary to obtain ride comfort data for single <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom random motions and for combinations of random motions. Accordingly, a simulator program was performed at the NASA Langley Research Center to measure subjective comfort response ratings using one <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom, two <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, and six <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom.
