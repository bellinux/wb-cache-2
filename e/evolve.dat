This Charizard can Mega <b>Evolve</b> into Mega Charizard X and has shown to be powerful by defeating 10 Mega Evolutions {{in a row and}} defeating Ash's Greninja, who had a type advantage. It also defeated Trevor's Charizard, who can easily Mega <b>Evolve</b> into Mega Charizard Y.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Evolve</b> is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. <b>Evolve</b> does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through <b>Evolve.</b> Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposite}} of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species <b>evolve</b> different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution occurs when two independent but similar species <b>evolve</b> {{in the same direction}} and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E

Thus the degree distribution of <b>evolving</b> network is transformed to the corresponding problem of <b>evolving</b> network Markov chains. First we investigate the <b>evolving</b> network Markov chains, and get its exact formulas and obtain a criteria to judge whether the steady degree distribution is power-law or not. Then we apply it to <b>evolving</b> networks. With this method, we get a rigorous, exact and unified solution of the steady degree distribution for <b>evolving</b> networks...|$|R

An introduction to <b>Evolving</b> Systems and exploration of the essential topics of the control and stability properties of <b>Evolving</b> Systems is provided.

5|$|<b>Evolve</b> {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives {{for both the}} Hunters and the Monster. <b>Evolve</b> provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as a}} five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having a toxic gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. <b>Evolve</b> also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolve</b> is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to <b>evolve</b> and make themselves more powerful.|$|E

5|$|<b>Evolve</b> uses an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, where five players—four {{playing as}} hunters and one as the monster—battle {{against each other}} on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay {{is based on the}} first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and <b>evolve</b> to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolve</b> was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for <b>Evolve</b> was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the <b>Evolve</b> project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly <b>evolve</b> into smooth curves, after which they <b>evolve</b> as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately <b>evolve</b> into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to <b>evolve</b> into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{evolution}} of networks has received increased interest {{with the recent}} discovery that many real-world networks possess many things in common, in particular the manner of evolution of such networks.

5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to <b>evolve.</b> This is important because most new genes <b>evolve</b> within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E

5|$|Prior to release, <b>Evolve</b> {{received}} a largely positive reception {{and won the}} Best of Show Awards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 and Gamescom 2014. The game was tested {{by the general public}} multiple times. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's atmosphere, asymmetrical structure, controls, and designs. However, it received criticism for its progression system and light narrative, gameplay, as well as a large amount of downloadable content prepared. <b>Evolve</b> was a commercial success, although the player base significantly dwindled shortly after release. In July 2016, it was announced that <b>Evolve</b> would be transitioning to become free-to-play, due to the mixed post-release reception, massive loss of playerbase, and the DLC controversy, but 2K decided to end the game's support approximately four months later.|$|E

A Pro-Am Tournament of <b>Evolve</b> took place on March 6, 2015 during PAX East. During the tournament, they revealed that the eSport future of <b>Evolve</b> is determined. On June 15, 2015, another tournament was hosted by the Electronic Sports League and 2K.|$|E
5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can <b>evolve</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular <b>evolve</b> in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also <b>evolve</b> in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics.
