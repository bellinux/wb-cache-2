Now while it is certainly possible to design multi-layer FSS structures using first principles codes and generalized scattering matrices (GSM), it is far easier, quicker and more intuitive to use equivalent circuit models for FSS design, since {{it is possible to}} leverage decades' worth of research performed on electrical <b>filter</b> <b>analysis</b> and design and bring it to bear on FSS structures.

40|$|Gravitational {{radiation}} from a slightly distorted black hole with ringdown waveform is well understood in general relativity. It provides a probe for direct observation of black holes and determination {{of their physical}} parameters, masses and angular momenta (Kerr parameters). For ringdown searches using data of gravitational wave detectors, matched filtering technique is useful. In this paper, we describe studies on problems in matched <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis</b> in realistic gravitational wave searches using observational data. Above all, we focus on template constructions, matches or signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), detection probabilities for Galactic events, and accuracies in evaluation of waveform parameters or black hole hairs. We have performed matched <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis</b> for artificial ringdown signals which are generated with Monte-Carlo technique and injected into the TAMA 300 observational data.

40|$|A fault {{diagnosis}} strategy {{based on the}} wayside acoustic monitoring technique is investigated for locomotive bearing {{fault diagnosis}}. Inspired by the transient modeling analysis method based on correlation <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis,</b> a so-called Parametric-Mother-Doppler-Wavelet (PMDW) is constructed with six parameters, including a center characteristic frequency and five kinematic model parameters. A Doppler effect eliminator containing a PMDW generator, a correlation <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis</b> module, and a signal resampler is invented to eliminate the Doppler effect embedded in the acoustic signal of the recorded bearing. Through the Doppler effect eliminator, the five kinematic model parameters can be identified based on the signal itself. Then, the signal resampler is applied to eliminate the Doppler effect using the identified parameters. With the ability to detect early bearing faults, the transient model analysis method is employed to detect localized bearing faults after the embedded Doppler effect is eliminated. The effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis strategy is verified via simulation studies and applications to diagnose locomotive roller bearing defects...|$|R

In this work, a <b>filter</b> <b>analysis</b> technique which addresses this fundamental limitation {{was used to measure}} mouth level exposures (MLE) to tar and nicotine in 1330 smokers of 26 brand-styles of US cigarettes covering a wide range of machine-generated yields. Despite the high degree of variability observed among individual smokers, MLEs were significantly correlated with machine-derived tar and nicotine yields (r= 0. 423 for nicotine MLE/cigarette; r= 0. 493 for tar MLE/cigarette; p< 0. 001 for both). Mean tar and nicotine MLE was higher for males than for females. Mean MLE across races was generally similar. Menthol cigarettes tended toward lower MLE than non-menthol cigarettes and King-Size cigarettes (∼ 83 mm) tended toward lower MLE than 100 ’s cigarettes (∼ 100 mm), though those trends were not statistically significant. There were good agreements between MLEs measured in a group of 159 subjects smoking their usual cigarette brand-style on two separate occasions and between two independent groups of subjects smoking the same brand-styles. The results indicated that the <b>filter</b> <b>analysis</b> method used had sufficient precision to show similarity among groups...|$|E

40|$|The {{explosive}} growth in sharing {{and consumption of}} the video content on the web creates a unique opportunity for scientific advances in video retrieval, recommendation and discovery. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} task of video suggestion, commonly found in many online applications. The current state-of-the-art video suggestion techniques are based on the collaborative <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis,</b> and suggest videos that are likely to be co-viewed with the watched video. In this paper, we propose augmenting the collab-orative <b>filtering</b> <b>analysis</b> with the topical representation of the video content to suggest related videos. We propose two novel methods for topical video representation. The first method uses information retrieval heuristics such as tf-idf, while the second method learns the optimal topical represen-tations based on the implicit user feedback available in the online scenario. We conduct a large scale live experiment on YouTube traffic, and demonstrate that augmenting col-laborative filtering with topical representations significantly improves the quality of the related video suggestions in a live setting, especially for categories with fresh and topically-rich video content such as news videos. In addition, we show that employing user feedback for learning the optimal topi-cal video representations can increase the user engagement by more than 80 % over the standard information retrieval representation, when compared to the collaborative filtering baseline...|$|R
