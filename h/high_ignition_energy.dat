40|$|Spark-ignited {{internal}} combustion engines {{are in the}} use for over 130 years (first example was presented by Otto in 1876). The engine development is directed to more power, better efficiency and lower emissions. Mixture formation and in-cylinder motion are the main parameters of the combustion process improvement. One of the effective methods of engine development is lean combustion. Application of lean-burn combustion systems in spark ignitron engines has been proposed many times. Such systems have several important advantages in comparison with conventional systems. Lean-burn combustion makes possible engine operation at high compression ratio, equivalent to high thermal efficiency and at low emission of toxic components of the combustion gases. Lean-burn combustion is also a subject of serious limitations, requiring remedial steps. General limitations are introduced by a fall of the reaction rate, equivalent to increased time of combustion. Lean-burn combustion introduces also changes to flame structure: it contributes with increased flame thickness and with a rise of quenching distance. These changes influence limit conditions of spark ignition. The only solution omitting this threat might be obtained by replacing of a spark ignition by another ignition system or by application of a spark ignition system with increased distance between electrodes and with much <b>higher</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> Typical solutions rationalizing lean-burn combustion in engines {{are discussed in the}} paper and some limit conditions highlighted. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{extensive}} {{investigation on}} experimental test of dust minimum explosible concentration (MEC) {{was carried out}} by using the Siwek 20 L vessel. Systematic data were reported on the MEC of various dusts and the influences of ignition energy, dust calorific value, moisture content and particle size were taken into account. It is found that the overly low or <b>high</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> will result in unrealistic MEC results. To reliably measure MEC, the experimental tests should be preformed under the condition that the test result is independent of ignition energy. For the Siwek 20 L vessel, the 4 - 6 kJ is the most appropriate energy ranges to determine the MEC of various dusts. The more incombustible component contained in lower calorific value dust acts as a thermal sink in the ignition and heating process of dust cloud, and therefore, the higher MEC {{can be found in the}} MEC measurement of lower calorific value dust. Moreover, due to the notable dust agglomeration, to validly measure MEC, the moisture content of test dust should not exceed 10 wt %. When the moisture content is lower than 10 wt %, the MEC smoothly increases with the rise of moisture content. With the decrease of particle size, the measured MEC becomes lower, and the MEC has an approximate linear relation with particle size. The results reported in this work provide the experimental basis and data guidance for the prevention and evaluation of dust explosion risk...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} as fuel represents a possible solution to reduce {{greenhouse gas emission}} from vehicles. Although proper engine running with hydrogen has been widely demonstrated, hydrogen storage onboard of the vehicle is a major problem.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown by the authors that the pre-chamber ignition technique operating with fuel-rich pre-chamber combustion strategy is a very effective means of extending the lean limit of combustion with excess air in heavy duty natural gas engines {{in order to improve}} indicated efficiency and reduce emissions. This article presents a study of the influence of pre-chamber volume and nozzle diameter on the resultant ignition characteristics. The two parameters varied are the ratio of pre-chamber volume to engine's clearance volume and the ratio of total area of connecting nozzle to the pre-chamber volume. Each parameter is varied in 3 steps hence forming a 3 by 3 test matrix. The experiments are performed on a single cylinder 2 L engine fitted with a custom made pre-chamber capable of spark ignition, fuel injection and pressure measurement. The measured main and pre-chamber pressure data is then used to perform heat release analysis to understand combustion phenomenon in pre-chamber and the ignition and combustion of fuel-lean charge in main chamber that follows. Within the span of parameter variation, it has been observed that a larger pre-chamber provides <b>higher</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> which results in shortened flame development angle and combustion duration. It is also observed that at a given pre-chamber volume, nozzle diameter mainly affects the combustion duration which may be due to difference in penetration depths of pre-chamber jets.

40|$|Running an {{internal}} combustion engine with diluted methane/air mixtures has a potential of reducing emissions and increasing efficiency. However, diluted mixtures need <b>high</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> in a sufficiently large volume, which is difficult to accomplish. Increasing the spark duration has {{shown to be a}} promising way of delivering more energy into the diluted charge, but this requires a more sophisticated ignition system. This work focuses on evaluating the effects regarding enhancing early flame development, reducing cyclic variations and extending the lean limit using a new capacitive ignition system as compared to a conventional inductive ignition system. The new system offers the opportunity to customise the spark by altering the electric pulse train characteristics choosing the number of pulses, the length of the individual pulses as well as the time delay between them. Several different spark configurations were evaluated for the new capacitive system, including varying spark duration between approximately 0. 5 - 1. 2 ms and maximum current levels of 0. 2 - 0. 4 A. Results show that longer spark duration and faster initial energy deposition has a positive effect on the lean limit and the combustion stability, while the current level shows little or no effect on these variables. The more advanced capacitive system is capable of delivering more energy and longer spark duration, resulting in reduced cyclic variations and enhanced early flame development. With the longer spark durations of the capacitive system the lean limit was extended from λ = 1. 65 to approximately λ = 1. 75...|$|E

40|$|Storing {{hydrogen}} {{is one of}} the major problems concerning its utilization on board vehicles. Today hydrogen can be compressed and stored at 200 or 350 bar (it is foreseen that in a near future storage pressure will reach 700 bar, according to new expected regulations and using tanks in composite materials) or cryogenically liquefied. An alternative solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small masses and volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. Moreover, ammonia contains almost 18 % hydrogen by mass and, by volume, liquid ammonia contains 1. 7 times as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen. It is well known that ammonia can be burned directly in I. C. engines, however a combustion promoter is necessary to support combustion especially in the case of high-speed S. I. engines. Among the potential promoters, {{hydrogen is}} worthy of note, since it is carbon free and counteracts ammonia combustion characteristics. As a matter of fact, hydrogen has high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterized by low flame speed, low flame temperature, narrow flammability range, <b>high</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> and high self-ignition temperature. The experimental activity shown in this paper is correlated with a project that is focused on a range-extended electric vehicle involving an ammonia-plus-hydrogen I.

Hydrogen and ammonia are separately injected in the gaseous phase. The only mechanical modification of the engine involves the intake manifold, where electro-injectors for hydrogen and for ammonia (conventional ones for CNG application with appropriate modification to inner parts) are added to the original ones for gasoline. The experimental results confirm that it is necessary to add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to increase combustion velocity, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed. Brake power is less than with gasoline, due to mixture poor volumetric heating value and to ammonia low flame speed that penalizes engine brake thermal efficiency.

40|$|The {{existence}} of flammable aerosols presents a high potential for fire hazards {{in the process}} industry. Various industrial fluids, most of which operate at elevated temperatures and pressures, can be atomized when released under high pressure through a small orifice. Because of the complexity {{in the process of}} aerosol formation and combustion, the availability of data on aerosol flammability and flame propagation behaviors is still quite limited, making it difficult to evaluate the potential fire and explosion risks from released aerosols in the process industry and develop safety measures for preventing and/or mitigating aerosol hazards. A study is needed to investigate the relationship between aerosol combustion behaviors and the properties of the aerosols. This dissertation presents research on the combustion behaviors of flammable aerosols. Monodisperse aerosols created by industrial heat transfer fluids were generated using electrospray. The characteristics of flame propagations in aerosols and the influence of the presence of fuel droplets in the system are studied in the aerosol ignition tests. Flames in aerosols are characterized by non-uniform shapes and discrete flame fronts. Flames were observed in different burning modes. Droplet evaporation was found {{to play an important role}} in aerosol burning modes. Droplet evaporation behaviors and fuel vapor distributions are further related to aerosol droplet size, droplet spacing, movement velocity, and liquid volatility. The burning mode of a global flame with rapid size expansion is considered the most hazardous aerosol combustion scenario. This burning mode requires a smaller droplet size and smaller space between droplets. Larger droplet sizes and spacing may hinder the appearance of global flames. But when the liquid fuel has a certain level of volatility, there is an uneven distribution of fuel vapor in the system and this may cause the unique phenomenon of burning mode variations combined with enhanced flame propagation speed. Using an integrated model, the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> values of aerosols were predicted. The aerosol minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> is influenced by the fuel-air equivalence ratio and the droplet size.

The 250-cubic-inch in-line six of [...] was offered as the base engine. The 454-cubic-inch V8, downrated yet again to , made it into 1975 as an El Camino option, but this would be its last go-around. It was not available in California, and the optional four-speed stick was no longer offered. Buyers could now choose an Econominder instrument package that included a vacuum gauge to point out when optimum fuel economy was being attained.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} the numerical simulation of a coal-dust monodisperse suspension sparkplug ignition in a methane-air mixture. The methane-air mixture is not stoichiometric. The {{aim of the}} research is a design-theoretical determination of the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> of coal-dust-methane-air mixture (CDMAM) depending on the methane volume fraction. Simulation has shown that the increase of the methane volume fraction leads to the decrease of the CDMAM minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> and with the expansion of coal particles the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> rises...|$|R
