5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade, {{the club}} won the league just {{once more in}} 1966–67. However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong {{position}} in Italian football. Under former player Čestmír Vycpálek, they won the scudetto in 1971–72 and 1972–73, with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and José Altafini breaking through. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into {{the early part of}} the 1980s. During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt where she underwent a three-year refit that strengthened her armament. She was fitted with mine rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers.

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland {{in the first two}} games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers.
