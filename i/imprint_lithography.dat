5000|$|<b>Imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> is {{inherently}} a three-dimensional patterning process. Imprint molds can be fabricated with {{multiple layers of}} topography stacked vertically. Resulting imprints replicate both layers with a single imprint step, which allows chip manufactures to reduce chip fabrication costs and improve product throughput.As mentioned above, the imprint material {{does not need to}} be finely tuned for high resolution and sensitivity. A broader range of materials with varying properties are available for use with <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography.</b> The increased material variability gives chemists the freedom to design new functional materials rather than sacrificial etch resistant polymers. [...] A functional material may be imprinted directly to form a layer in a chip with no need for pattern transfer into underlying materials. The successful implementation of a functional imprint material would result in significant cost reductions and increased throughput by eliminating many difficult chip fabrication processing steps.|$|E

50|$|Since {{at least}} 1998 near field optical {{lithography}} {{was designed to}} create nanometer-scale features. Research on this technology continued as the first experimentally demonstrated negative index metamaterial came into existence in 2000-2001.

50|$|Recently, two {{developments}} have given contact lithography potential for comeback in semiconductor lithography. First, surface plasmon resonance enhancements {{including the use}} of silver films as lenses have been demonstrated to give resolution of less than 50 and even 22 nm using wavelengths of 365 and 436 nm. The exotic dispersion relation of surface plasmon has led to the extremely short wavelength, which helps to break the diffraction limit.Second, nanoimprint lithography has already gained popularity outside the semiconductor sector (e.g., hard-drive, biotechnology) and is a candidate for sub-45 nm semiconductor lithography, driving defect reduction practices and uniformity improvement for masks in contact with the substrate. Step-and-flash <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> (SFIL), a popular form of nanoimprint lithography which involves UV curing of the imprint film, essentially uses the same setup as contact lithography.|$|E

There are a variety of molecular imprinting techniques used for the preparation of biomimetic sensors including bulk imprinting, surface <b>imprinting</b> (soft <b>lithography,</b> template immobilization, grafting, emulsion polymerization) and epitope imprinting.

Spheres stacked in some layers and infiltrated by a suitable light-transmitting media can be employed as direct opal (DO) photonic crystals (PC’s) [5, 6]. Moreover, arrays of colloidal spheres are commonly used as templates for inverted opals (IOs), which can work as PC’s or as gas sensors [6 – 8].|$|R
5000|$|The {{flexible}} {{electronic paper}} display technology co-developed by Arizona State University and HP employs a manufacturing process developed by HP Labs called Self-Aligned <b>Imprint</b> <b>Lithography</b> (SAIL). The screens are made by layering stacks of semi-conductor materials and metals between pliable plastic sheets. The stacks need to be perfectly aligned and stay that way. Alignment proves difficult during manufacturing when heat during manufacturing can deform the materials and when the resulting screen also needs to remain flexible. The SAIL process gets around this by ‘printing’ the semiconductor pattern on a fully composed substrate, so that the layers always remain in perfect alignment. The limitation of the material the screen is based on allows only a finite amount of full rolls, hence limiting its commercial application as a flexible display.

These machines implement a new lithography process known as Step and Flash <b>Imprint</b> <b>Lithography</b> (SFIL) and are intended for 1) sub 100 nm imprint demonstrations on flat substrates and 2) investigation of potential defect propagation during step and repeat imprinting. SFIL is an <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> process that {{is a combination of}} chemical and mechanical steps and its implementation at room temperature and low pressure makes it an attractive process as compared to other imprint techniques. A critical component of an imprint machine is the orientation stage that is required to provide uniform intimate contact between the template and substrate surfaces. The orientation stage requirements are distinct from those used in photolithography since the depth of focus of projection optics allows for larger errors in the orientation alignment. Also, due to contact between the template and substrate surfaces in <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography,</b> the separation kinematics must be carefully controlled in the SFIL process. Two different orientation stages are designed for single- and multi-imprint machines.

Herein, we demonstrate the directional photomanipulation of breath figure arrays (BFAs) formed by an azobenzene-containing block copolymer to address the aforementioned problems. Under the irradiation of linearly polarized light, the round pores in the BFAs were converted to rectangular, rhombic, and parallelogram-shaped pores in 30 min, due to the anisotropic mass migration based on the photo-reconfiguration of the azobenzene units. Through a secondary irradiation after rotating the sample by 90 °, the transformed pores were apparently recovered. Therefore, this non-contacted, directional photomanipulation technique in conjunction with breath figure processing opens a new route to nano/microporous films with finely tuned features...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> is simple {{and it has been}} used to create submicron structures into polymers for several years. In addition to cost beneficials due to simple process the <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> can be used for patterning directly to various surfaces, e. g. conductive polymers [1], as far as the material is deformable physically by molding. This means, that the applications of <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> are not restricted to semiconductor manufacturing. The patterning facility needs only a mold and a press {{that can be used to}} push the mold onto the substrate.

The arrays are fabricated by very economical soft <b>lithography</b> <b>imprinting</b> of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold (itself obtained from a Ni master stamp that is generated from holographic interference lithography of a photoresist) on a UV-curable polyurethane drop placed on the glass.

When the μLA is ~ 15 × 15 mm 2, i. e., much larger than the ~ 3 × 3 mm 2 OLED pixel, the electroluminescence (EL) in the forward direction is enhanced by ~ 100 %.

40|$|Main {{aim of the}} {{research}} has been the development of alternative lithography strategies for the fabrication of complex, flexible electronic devices. Flexible bottom-contact, bottom-gate thin-film transistors were solely patterned with UV nanoimprint lithography on poly(ethylene naphthalate) foil. Patterning and process strategies had to be developed for thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography to control the residual layer thickness and its complete removal on the temperature sensitive, mechanically and in-plane instable foils. The foil was temporarily bonded to a supporting carrier (foil-on-carrier) to reduce the bending radius and in-plane waviness of the foil, and to provide a mechanically stable platform for proper processing. Foil-on-carriers were thermally flat <b>imprinted</b> with nanoimprint <b>lithography,</b> or a flat plateau was created on the foil-on-carrier by UV nanoimprint lithography-based step-and-repeat planarization. Thin-film transistors with a channel length from 5 μm down to 250 nm were obtained and characterized. Palladium nanoparticles and self-sintering silver nanoparticles were studied as a solution-based route for fast, low-cost and room temperature patterning of metallic wires in open microchannels on flexible foils. The ease of patterning thin but very conductive silver wires from a long-term stable aqueous solution allows integration in a roll-two-roll line to pattern the metallic contacts of a flexible electronic device. The here studied fabrication methods can be potentially integrated in low-cost, high-throughput roll-to-roll fabrication lines and represent in combination with a self-aligned device layout a strategy for future generations of flexible electronic devices...|$|R
30|$|The {{growth of}} ZnO {{nanowires}} with precise {{control of their}} alignment, distribution, and aspect ratio is highly desirable for their potential applications in sensor arrays, high-efficiency photonic devices, near-UV lasers, and for assembling complex three-dimensional nanoscale systems [4 – 10]. A straightforward approach for this purpose is to fabricate metal nanoparticles, which are used as catalyst templates for the subsequent vapor–liquid-solid (VLS) growth of patterned nanowires [11]. In the past few years, numbers of approaches have been proposed to obtain nanoscale metal catalysts for the fabrication of patterned ZnO nanowire arrays, such as electron beam lithography (EBL), soft-photolithography, and mask lithography by porous alumina, self-assembled micro- or nanospheres [12 – 17]. EBL {{is known as a}} relatively complicated and costly method, thus unsuitable for large-scale fabrication. In contrast, <b>imprint</b> and nanosphere <b>lithography</b> (NSL) tend to be more promising as they are less costly techniques with a much higher throughput. Recently, several groups have reported the large-scale fabrication of ZnO nanowires using NSL technique [15 – 17]. However, the ZnO nanowires in these reports are either not nanopatterned or not truly vertically aligned. The limitation might result from the interconnection of the printed Au, un-optimized growth conditions and/or imperfect lattice matching between substrates and ZnO nanowires [15 – 17]. These drawbacks might hinder the consideration of such nanowire arrays from device applications. In addition, the VLS process is the most widely used technique for growing aligned ZnO, in which gold is the most frequently chosen metal catalyst [18 – 20]. However, as limited by the clean room requirements for silicon technology, gold is not the choice of metal for integrating with silicon. Therefore, it is important to explore a catalyst-free technique for ZnO nanowire growth.|$|R

The yield of imprinted snakes was found to fall rapidly with decreasing feature size. For example, the yield of 1 : 5 50 nm short snakes was only about 55 %. Complementary optical inspection suggested feature pullout (release agent failure and mechanical layer separation) was a prevailing occurrence. Qualitatively, defects were binned into four primary, broad categories: self-cleaning template defects; non self-cleaning template defects; imprint-impeding defects; and template damaging defects. Additionally, the template cleaning process employed was found to be fairly efficient at removing particles, particularly when considering defects at the larger feature sizes.

40|$|Nanoimprint {{lithography}} (NIL) is a cost-efficient nanopatterning technology {{because of}} its promising advantages of high throughput and high resolution. However, accurate multilevel overlay capability of NIL required for integrated circuit manufacturing remains a challenge due to {{the high cost of}} achieving mechanical alignment precision. Although self-aligned <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> was developed to avoid the need of alignment for the vertical layered structures, it has limited usage in the manufacture of the coplanar structures, such as integrated plasmonic devices. In this paper, we develop a new process of planar self-alignment <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> (P-SAIL) to fabricate the metallic and dielectric structures on the same plane.

40|$|Background: Nanoimprinting {{lithography}} technique uses a {{very simple}} concept of transferring pattern of nanoscale features from a mold to a target substrate. In the past two decades, this technique has successfully broken through the barrier of laboratory scale production and become an industrial scale production technique. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce to readers to the basic working principle, applications, analysis the technological limitations. It will also point out future research direction of this useful nanofabrication technique. Methods: We adopted a systematic approach to give a comprehensive review of the work principle, hardware and analysis of advantaged and disadvantages of major nanoimprint lithography techniques. Moreover, a technical comparison of these methods is carried out to provide future research direction. Results: 87 papers were reviewed. Four techniques including thermal NIL, ultraviolet light NIL, laser-assisted direct <b>imprint</b> and nanoelectrode <b>lithography</b> have been identified as main stream of NIL techniques. These techniques possess certain advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, throughput, attainable resolution. Lack of flexibility is the common limitation of current NIL techniques. NIL has gained wide applications in the fabrication of optoelectronics devices, solar cells, memory devices, nanoscale cells, hydrophobic surfaces and bio-sensors. The potential applications of NIL in biochips, artificial organs, diagnostic system, and fundamental research in cell biology will demand large scale 3 D fabrication capability with resolution towards 10 nm or less. Conclusions: The findings of this review confirm that NIL is one of the most employed commercial platforms for nanofabrication which offers high throughput and cost-effectiveness. One of the disadvantages of NIL over other nanofabrication techniques is the flexibility of patterning. Integrating NIL with other existing nanofabrication techniques can be helpful to overcome such issue. The potential applications of NIL in biochips, artificial organs, diagnostic system, and fundamental research in cell biology will attract researchers to push nanoimprint lithography forward at a resolution of 10 nm or less in the future...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric icing {{event is}} {{problematic}} for outdoor structures {{because it can}} damage, slow, impede, and danger general routine. For a wind turbine blade, it can damage, disrupt movement, and cause potentially dangerous ice throw. Anti-icing based on a surface texture is advantageous due to the low cost of maintenance {{and there is no}} additional requirement of energy output for preventing the icing problem. This work is based on the biomimicry of the superhydrophobic nature of the lotus leaf, whereas the limited wettability supports the water to flow freely from the surface structure. The phenomenon is based on a morphology and composition of the micro-nano scale hierarchical surface features: papilla, micro-pillars, coated in wax nanostructures. The objective of this research is the creation and testing of a surface texture, similar to the lotus formed onto the surface structure of polyurethane coatings. The hypothesis is that a micron size surface texture will prevent the water from penetrating the surface features based on the water 2 ̆ 7 s surface tension. Also, it is hypothesized that due to the decreased wetting contact between the water and surface, there is a delay in the time for the water to freeze. The thesis objective was realized through a soft <b>lithography</b> <b>imprinting</b> of a surface texture from a created template. A short timed acid texture created the additional submicron-nanostructure on the surface, resulting in a coating modification with similar structure to the lotus. Characterizations of the coatings were performed using Contact Angle Measurements (CAM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscopy (OM) and Surface Profilometer (SP). The textured polyurethane surfaces showed an increase of the water contact angles as compared to the non-textured surfaces. The air trapped within the surface texture forced the water to bead-up on top of the surface structures. The texture surfaces gave a decrease in the ice to surface contact area consequently resulting in the delayed icing mechanism...|$|R

For prepatterned guided anodization, imprinting methods have been used by several author groups to prepare ordered AAO, wherein nanoindentations are created by transferring patterns from hard master stamp onto the Al surface under a high pressure (5 - 25 kN cm- 2) before anodization [8 – 10]. Despite the ideally ordered patterns obtained, this method is limited by the pattern transfer protocol, and pattern transferred by <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> directly onto metallic substrates such as Al foils or Al films requires 50 - 2000 times higher pressures in comparison with <b>imprint</b> <b>lithography</b> on polymer layers [11].
