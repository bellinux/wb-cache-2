5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> beneficial in Galba's eyes.

The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories.

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way.</b> This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.

Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way.

The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
