Three beam tests have been carried out on the new Asymmetrie 'Slinzflor' Beam (ASB) as part of the 'Slimdek' system. and these tests demonstrate that considerable composite action can be achieved with the concrete encasement. Two major fire tests carried out in the Netherlands demonstrated that 60 min fire resistance can be achieved for slim-floor constructions, depending on the magnitude of the load level.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of extending to steel moment resisting frames a retrofitting technique, previously developed for RC structures, is investigated in this work. This technique {{is based on}} the incorpo¬ration of energy dissipating devices around the regions where inelastic behaviour due to a strong earthquake is expected. This extension, however, is not straightforward, due to the deeply different nonlinear behaviour of steel and RC members under cyclic flexure. Therefore, in a first step, a numerically efficient analytical beam model has been developed, to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the devices, and has been implemented in the computer code STEFAN for the nonlinear analysis of steel plane frames, which adopts realistic models for both beam elements and joint panel zones. Secondly, making use of the code STEFAN, an 8 -story, 5 -bay frame, designed according to <b>Eurocodes</b> <b>3</b> and 8 prescriptions, has been analysed, both in its original and redesigned state.

40|$|The hybrid force/displacement (HFD) seismic design {{method for}} planar steel frames {{developed}} by the authors is extended to 3 D steel buildings using moment-resisting frames.

The phenomenon {{is difficult to}} take into account during design of composite bridges, as it takes place just after slab casting, when material properties of concrete are quickly changing with time. Recommendations on this topic in design codes and literature are generally poor and sometimes ambiguous.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{providing}} a tool for the comprehensive seismic analysis of steel moment resisting frames (MRFs), the paper presents {{the development of a}} structural model which is able to describe the deformation modes of the panel zone in beam-tocolumns joints, without resorting to a computationally heavy FE discretization. The model is able {{to take into account the}} finite dimensions of the joint, differently from the ‘‘scissor model’’ currently adopted, and can incorporate the most recently proposed constitutive models for monotonic and cyclic loading. The proposed approach, based on a simple structural representation of the joint, does not modify the centre-to-centre line scheme and the nodal degrees of freedom usually adopted in the analysis of plane frames, but adds upto five more degrees of freedom to each node. These describe the deformation modes of the panel zone, namely extensional, flexural and due to shear. A non-linear behaviour can be associated to each of these modes; based on experimental results, a simple hysteretic model is proposed for the shear deformation. The panel zone model has been implemented in an ad hoc developed computer code for the non linear seismic analysis of steel MRFs (named STEFAN, STEel Frame ANalysis), including a non-linear fracturing beam model as well. As an example of application, the dynamic behaviour of a 5 -bay 9 -story frame designed according to <b>Eurocodes</b> <b>3</b> (EC 3) and 8 (EC 8) has been investigated, for different panel zone stiffness and with different models, both in the linear and non linear range, emphasizing the need for a correct panel zone modelling...|$|R

Indeed, this approximate approach appears to be conservative for unstiffened sections, according to the experimental investigation that has been followed by Heva and Mahendran.

40|$|Conventional seismic-resistant {{structural}} {{systems are}} currently designed {{to develop a}} global sway plastic mechanism under strong earthquakes, {{which is achieved by}} allowing the development of controlled inelastic deformations in specific locations of main structural members such as beams, bases of columns and braces. Inelastic deformations in structural members result in damage and residual drifts, and therefore, in economic losses such as repair costs and downtime. Moreover, earthquake reconnaissance reports reveal large economic losses related to non-structural damage, e. g. failure of walls due to large storey drifts or failure of acceleration-sensitive equipment due to large peak floor accelerations. These losses highlight the need for resilient structures with the potential to remain intact after frequently occurred earthquakes and return to service within an acceptable short, if not immediate, time after strong rare earthquakes. Moreover, resilient structures should provide a very low probability of collapse (i. e. increased life safety) under very rare maximum considered earthquake. Steel self-centering moment-resisting frames using post-tensioned beam-column connections are a promising class of resilient structures. They exhibit softening force-drift behaviour and eliminate inelastic deformations and residual drifts as the result of gap openings developed in beam-column interfaces and elastic post tensioned bars which clamp beams to columns and provide self-centering capability. Also, post tensioned connections use energy dissipation devices, which are activated when gaps open and can be easily replaced if damaged. Steel frames equipped with passive dampers are another class of resilient structures. Dampers provide supplemental damping to control drifts, and thus, provide an effective means to achieve economical designs with high performance. The main goal of this PhD is to develop a seismic design and assessment procedure for steel self-centering moment-resisting frames (SC-MRFs) with viscous dampers within the framework of <b>Eurocodes</b> <b>3</b> and 8. To achieve this goal, nonlinear models of post-tensioned connections, able to capture the strength and stiffness deterioration due to local buckling, are developed. These models enable the assessment of the seismic behaviour of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers up to collapse with the aid of nonlinear dynamic analysis. A seismic design method, which incorporates a robust way to estimate rotation demands in post-tensioned connections, is then formulated. Different SC-MRFs with viscous dampers are designed using the proposed design procedure to study different design scenarios. The accuracy of the design procedure is evaluated through nonlinear dynamic analysis. In addition, the superior collapse resistance of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers is validated through incremental dynamic analysis. The thesis concludes with the implementation of an advanced probabilistic framework for direct economic seismic loss estimation and its application to confirm the potential of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers to significantly reduce economic seismic losses...|$|R
