5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in <b>doubt,</b> <b>and</b> it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Despite the poem's <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> darkness, {{a note of}} hope {{is struck}} by {{the first line of}} the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'.

No. 11 Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{constructed}} by the Dinn Corporation, Mean Streak {{opened to the public}} on on May 11, 1991, as the tallest wooden coaster in the world with the longest drop height. Cedar Point closed Mean Streak on September 16, 2016, casting <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty regarding the ride's future. The park dropped subtle hints over the following year that the ride was being refurbished. On August 16, 2017, Cedar Point officially announced the conversion of Mean Streak into Steel Vengeance, marketed as the first hybrid hypercoaster. Before its official opening, a virtual recreation of the ride was made available in the video game, Planet Coaster.|$|E
5|$|Soundgarden is an American {{rock band}} formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's {{full-time}} drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Cornell remained in Soundgarden {{until his death}} in May 2017, putting the band's future in <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> leaving Thayil as the only remaining original member of the band.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a <b>Doubt</b> <b>and</b> The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{near the}} end of the 2006 season, word began to surface that Favre was {{considering}} retirement. In fact, playing in Soldier Field against the arch-rival Bears in the season finale, Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis. Moments later at the postgame interview, he gave a tearful interview with an NBC Sports correspondent, where he admitted his future was still questionable. However, after much debate, he returned for the 2007 season, during which his future was once again in <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> an oft-discussed topic, with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl, Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented Aaron Rodgers, who was drafted two years earlier as Favre's heir-apparent. Ultimately, the Packers fell in the NFC Championship to the New York Giants (who in turn upset the heavily favored and previously undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII).|$|E

5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, {{following}} official protests, the Japanese government {{issued a}} statement formally denying responsibility for the sinking of Centaur. Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility. Although Centaurs sinking was a war crime, no one was tried for sinking the hospital ship. Investigations into the attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948, and included the interrogation of the commanders of the submarines operating in Australian waters at the time, their superiors, plus junior officers and crewmen from the submarines who had survived the war. Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I-177 were most likely responsible, but {{they were unable to}} establish this beyond reasonable <b>doubt,</b> <b>and</b> the Centaur case file was closed on 14 December 1948 without any charges laid.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, {{the unit}} was reorganised {{as the war}} moved north and {{planning}} began for it to deploy further afield. Major Lennard Cumpston took over command from Guiney in March. Meanwhile, in March and April a number of stations closed or transferred to ANGAU following {{a reduction in the}} threat of large-scale air raids against Australian controlled territory. As debate about the future employment of Australian forces in the Pacific continued, the future of the unit was in <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> there was consideration given to it being disbanded. However, following a request from the Americans a detachment of 43 signalers, cipher operators, and medical orderlies was subsequently attached to US forces during operations as part of the advance to Hollandia and Tadji, with the NGAWW being the only Australian unit involved in this action.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the species}} once {{inhabited}} rainforests, swamps, and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in Sichuan. They are now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra and one on Borneo. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in <b>doubt,</b> <b>and</b> one of the Sumatran populations may already be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from {{the northern part of}} Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia); however, a tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with <b>doubt</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|Reigomys primigenus is an extinct oryzomyine rodent {{known from}} Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Tarija Department, southeastern Bolivia. It is known {{from a number}} of isolated jaws and molars which show that its molars were almost identical to those of the living Lundomys. On the other hand, the animal possesses a number of derived traits of the palate which document a closer relationship to living Holochilus, the genus of South American marsh rats, and for this reason it was placed in the genus Holochilus when it was first described in 1996. The subsequent discoveries of Noronhomys and Carletonomys, which may be more closely related to extant Holochilus than H.primigenus is, have cast its placement in Holochilus into <b>doubt,</b> <b>and</b> it was ultimately made the type species of a separate genus, Reigomys.|$|E
