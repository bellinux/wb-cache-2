5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina's support, {{executing}} the Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

Saladin granted his request, provided that Balian not take up arms against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> remain in Jerusalem {{for more than one}} day; however, upon arrival in the holy city, Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla, {{and the rest of the}} inhabitants begged him to take charge of the defense of the city. Heraclius, who argued that he must stay for the sake of Christianity, offered to absolve him of the oath, and Balian agreed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the weeks}} pass, Blanche and Stanley {{continue}} to not get along. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella {{that she wants}} to go away with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> be anyone’s problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later committed suicide when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. It seems certain that they will get married.|$|E
25|$|After {{months of}} testing by specialists the doctors {{concluded}} {{he had a}} genetic condition called Alexander's disease. They warned her against having more children. Messenger states that her son did not progress past a 4-month old's development {{even when he was}} one year old. She concluded that because of the timing of the vaccinations, the baby's reactions and other parents' stories it was the vaccine that killed <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> a genetic disease. She has since stated that there is a conspiracy with pharmaceutical companies and the medical community to cover-up vaccine related problems, because of financial incentives. She feels like she was lied to by the doctors and believes parents should have all the information about vaccinations in order for the parent to make good decisions.|$|E

25|$|In early March 1919 men {{started to}} {{takeover}} Leverhulme's farms on Lewis. They drove off the farmers' livestock, demolished boundary walls, and staked out six-acre plots: {{by the summer}} sixteen out of the twenty-two farms on the island had been affected. Expecting Leverhulme's approval, the raiders were taken aback when he voiced his complete condemnation of their actions {{and asked them to}} withdraw from his land. Some left, but others erected shelters for their families on the stolen plots. Leverhulme was evidently not willing to prosecute ex-servicemen who were trying to secure homes for their families, and it seems unlikely that, under the circumstances, legal action would have succeeded. Instead, he toured Lewis trying to persuade them that their future lay with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> in the crofting system. They were, however, extremely reluctant to abandon old ways and most of them continued to espouse the crofting way of life.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy's tough {{schedule}} eventually {{caught up}} with him as he missed the cut at his next two events. First at the BMW PGA Championship, he opened with an average one-under-par 71 but faded the next day to a 6-over 78. He claiming mental fatigue got the better of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> its physical counterpart. The following week at the Irish Open, McIlroy shot a first round 80 to lie 9-over and in a tie for last place. The following day he managed a level-par 71 around Royal County Down which left him 4 shots off the halfway cut. McIlroy stated he had left himself too much to do after a poor Thursday performance in front of his home Northern Irish fans and at the event he now hosts. He later said he was looking forward to a break after five tournaments in a row.|$|E
25|$|Sammartino {{found himself}} with even fewer dates and payoffs {{than the first}} time he {{wrestled}} for McMahon. He gave notice to McMahon {{that he was going to}} San Francisco, and its large Italian population, to wrestle for promoter Roy Shire. Very soon after arriving, Sammartino was informed by the local athletic commission that he was suspended. Unable to find work across the country (because every state athletic commission honors suspensions given by other state athletic commissions), Sammartino headed back to Pittsburgh to work as a laborer. Sammartino found out that his suspension was due to his skipping a match he was booked for in Baltimore. He was also booked to wrestle in Chicago that same night. In his autobiography, Sammartino states that he believed McMahon set him up, by double-booking <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> informing him of his match in Baltimore, as a way of punishment for working for Kwariani.|$|E

25|$|Myshkin {{makes the}} {{acquaintance}} of Lizaveta Prokovyevna {{and her three}} daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya, the last being the youngest and the most beautiful. They are all very curious about <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} god of beginnings {{has been}} clearly expressed in numerous ancient sources, among them most notably Cicero, Ovid, and Varro. As a god of motion, Janus looks after passages, causes actions {{to start and}} presides over all beginnings. Since movement and change are interconnected, he has a double nature, symbolised in his two headed image. He has under his tutelage the stepping {{in and out of}} the door of homes, the ianua, which took its name from <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> vice versa. Similarly, his tutelage extends to the covered passages named iani and foremost to the gates of the city, including the cultic gate of the Argiletum, named Ianus Geminus or Porta Ianualis from which he protects Rome against the Sabines. He is also present at the Sororium Tigillum, where he guards the terminus of the ways into Rome from Latium. He has an altar, later a temple near the Porta Carmentalis, where the road leading to Veii ended, as well as being present on the Janiculum, a gateway from Rome out to Etruria.|$|E
25|$|De Valera {{balked at}} the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the {{negotiations}} because he knew what the outcome would be and {{did not wish to}} receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over {{the fact that they had}} not consulted with him, their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the Dáil during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the Treaty Ports, the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.|$|E

25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had {{made it clear that they}} wanted <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{was born}} in Riyadh, growing up there in a working-class environment, to a family of Hadhrami descent from the Hadhramaut Governorate. His father Abdulrahman Ahmed was a former player, he the {{youngest}} of two sisters and three older brothers, Ahmad, Khaled and Mohammed. He began playing football {{at a very young}} age and was playing most of his time in Riyadh neighborhoods. He drew attention from scout Abdulrahman Eissa, who saw him by chance at Al Malaz yard near Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and admired his talent and asked about the club that he played for. The answer was that he was not playing for any club and also did not hold Saudi nationality. After Abdulrahman Eissa began to contact him and his brother, he then began participating in tournaments and courses alongside Yahya Al-Shehri. In 2000, he went on a trial with Al Hilal who were very interested in signing him. However, as full Saudi nationality was only offered to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> his entire family, his father rejected the offer. Then a call came to Abdulrahman Eissa's friend Ahmed Al Garoon from Honorary member of Al Ain, Nasser bin Thaloub who was searching for young talented players. Abdulrahman Eissa told him about Omar's talent and his brothers Mohammed and Khalid. He asked for their passports and they joined the external Al Ain camp in Germany. Al Ain agreed to grant citizenship to his whole family who then moved to the United Arab Emirates. Omar joined the club with two of his brothers and enrolled in the club's youth academy.|$|E

500|$|Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-born {{scientist}} at Harvard University who, by 1896, {{had established a}} reputation for [...] "lock a student up {{in a room full}} of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> let him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained." [...] Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, David Starr Jordan, Addison Emery Verrill, and Burt Green Wilder. American literary critic Robert Scholes traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and Samuel Hubbard Scudder. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction. Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.|$|E
