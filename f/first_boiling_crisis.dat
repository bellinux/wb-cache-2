We discuss the <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis,</b> a transition between two regimes of boiling: nucleate and film <b>boiling.</b> The <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> results in a sharp decrease in the heat transfer rate, which can cause a major accident in industrial heat exchangers. In this communication, we present a physical model of the <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> based on the vapor recoil effect. Under {{the action of the}} vapor recoil the gas bubbles begin to spread over the heater thus forming a germ for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only causes its spreading, it also creates a strong adhesion to the heater that prevents the bubble departure, thus favoring the further spreading. Near the liquid-gas critical point, the bubble growth is very slow and allows the kinetics of the bubble spreading to be observed. Since the surface tension is very small in this regime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a convex bubble shape. In the experiments both in the Mir space station and in the magnetic levitation facility, we directly observed an increase of the apparent contact angle and spreading of the dry spot under the bubble.

40|$|International audienceBy {{performing}} near-critical fluid {{experiments in}} the weightlessness of an orbiting space vehicle, we have suppressed buoyancy-driven flows and gravitational constraints on the liquid-gas interface of a large gas bubble. At equilibrium, the liquid completely wets {{the walls of a}} cylindrical cell, and the bubble is pushed to the sidewall. In these experiments the system's temperature T is increased at a constant rate past the critical temperature Tc, pushing it slightly out of equilibrium. The wetting film shows a large mechanical response to this heating, including contact lines that recede on a solid surface and a spreading bubble. Near Tc, the receding contact lines make the entire bubble appear to spread along the copper sidewall. The spreading bubble is a manifestation of the <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> near the critical point. We present quantitative data of the receding contact lines that are observed prior to the near-critical <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis.</b> We analyze the receding contact lines in detail, and find that they are driven by vapor recoil from evaporation, as is the spreading bubble of the <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we {{describe}} the <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> (departure from nucleate boiling) as a transition between two regimes of bubble growth: " bubble departure " and " bubble spreading, " which occur for small and large heat fluxes, respectively. The threshold heat flux is the critical heat flux (CHF). Our assumptions are based on existing experimental observations. The <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> {{is assumed to be}} triggered by spreading of dry spots under individual bubbles that occurs due to the apparent contact angle growth, when the apparent contact angle attains 90 °. Such a mechanism is studied via numerical simulation of the single bubble growth. The apparent contact angle is obtained from the hydrodynamic modeling of the vicinity of the triple contact line (microregion). The microregion model is based on the lubrication approximation extended to treat high interface slopes. The microregion model is compared to previous experimental and numerical data obtained for moderate heater superheating values. The macroregion is modeled within a simplified 2 D quasistationary approach that neglects the fluid motion. The CHF obtained from such a formulation is calculated as a function of gravity level and the heater wetting properties. The results agree qualitatively with existing experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to give an overview of the capabilities of Eulerian bifluid approach to meet the needs of studies for nuclear safety regarding hydrogen risk, <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis,</b> and pipes and valves maintenance. The Eulerian bifluid approach has been implemented in a CFD code named NEPTUNE_CFD. NEPTUNE_CFD is a three-dimensional multifluid code developed especially for nuclear reactor applications by EDF, CEA, AREVA, and IRSN. The first set of models is dedicated to wall vapor condensation and spray modelling. Moreover, <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> remains a major limiting phenomenon for the analysis of operation and safety of both nuclear reactors and conventional thermal power systems. The paper aims at presenting the generalization of the previous DNB model and its validation against 1500 validation cases. The modelling and the numerical simulation of cavitation phenomena are of relevant interest in many industrial applications, especially regarding pipes and valves maintenance where cavitating flows are responsible for harmful acoustics effects. In the last section, models are validated against experimental data of pressure profiles and void fraction visualisations obtained downstream of an orifice with the EPOCA facility (EDF R&D). Finally, a multifield approach is presented as an efficient tool to run all models together...|$|R

Published correlations of {{critical heat flux}} in helical coils are collated. The characteristics of <b>boiling</b> <b>crisis</b> in helical coils are studied. The experiments are performed with six helical coils made of SS 304 tubes having inner diameters varying from 6 to 10 mm. The coil diameter to the tube diameter ratio ranges from 14 to 58. The critical heat flux data are collected in complete saturated region for the quality range of 0 - 1. The wall temperature distribution is measured in the axial direction using infrared thermal imaging technique. The results concluded that, the wall temperature in inner half surface is higher than outer half surface of helical coils. Increase in mass flux increases the critical heat flux. Critical heat flux decreases with increase in quality. For the same quality, the critical heat flux decreases with increase in tube diameter and coil diameter. In a high quality region, the critical heat flux in helical coils is higher than vertical straight tubes. A correlation is suggested for critical heat flux in helical coils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
