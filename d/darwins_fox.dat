50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Reverend William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox</b> {{collected}} two small thighbones near Cowleaze Chine on the southwest coast of the Isle of Wight. In 1868 he incorrectly suggested these {{may have come from}} the same individual that had in 1848 been uncovered for Gideon Mantell as a fossil of Iguanodon, and which in 1869 would be named as the new genus Hypsilophodon. Regardless, both femora, made part of the collection of the British Museum of Natural History as specimens BMNH R184 and BMNH R185, would be commonly referred to the latter genus.|$|R
30|$|By 1827, Darwin pursued coleopteran {{collecting}} {{as if it}} were a fulltime profession. This {{coincided with}} declining interests in university classes and dropping grades. His fascination with nature, and an aversion to blood in the operating theaters, cast off any chance of becoming a surgeon and following his father into medicine. However, the beetle collection kept growing, thanks to his coleopteran mentor, Cousin William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox.</b> Here Charles met a man determined to fill his Cambridge dorm room with beetles, stuffed swans, incubating moth pupae, and a mounted female goosander shot by Darwin, to name but a few.|$|R
2500|$|By September 1854 {{his second}} volume of Barnacles had been printed and dispatched, {{and he turned}} his {{attention}} to Species, telling his cousin William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox</b> that he planned to [...] "view all facts that I can master..to see how far they favour or are opposed to the notion that wild species are mutable or immutable". All available information was examined for [...] "hostile facts" [...] and discussed with Hooker, who had resisted what he called Darwin's [...] "Elastic theory" [...] but who was now developing an [...] "utter disbelief of my own Genera and species".|$|R
2500|$|Darwin's cousin William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox</b> {{continued}} to give hims strong support, warning him against overworking on his huge book and recommending a holiday, but Darwin was immersed in his experiments and his writing. [...] "I am got most deeply {{interested in my}} subject; though I wish I could set less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than I do, but not, I think, to any extreme degree; yet, if I know myself, I would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my Book wd be published for ever anonymously".|$|R

This hall had previously been the home of William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox.</b> His prep school was in the next village of Shardlow, where he studied until he started at Repton School which was still within south Derbyshire. This association with Repton continued as later he would become both a member and later chair of their governors.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the start}} of his second year Charles became the tenant of the rooms at Christ's College which {{traditionally}} had been occupied by the theologian William Paley.

At the Christmas holiday Charles visited London with Eras, toured the scientific institutions [...] "where Naturalists are gregarious" [...] and through his friend the Revd. Frederick William Hope met other insect collectors. These included James Stephens, author of Illustrations of British Entomology".|$|R
25|$|Variation under {{domestication}} {{became a}} major topic of research: in 1855 he began to develop a web of contacts, both in the UK and worldwide, to get information on the origins and variation of domesticated animals, particularly poultry, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons. He got extensive information, specimens and ideas from Edward Blyth in India, who put him in contact with Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa. At the suggestion of William Yarrell, Darwin began pigeon breeding at Down House to investigate varieties of domestic pigeons, and gained access to the expertise of William Bernhard Tegetmeier who was glad to research aspects of interest to Darwin. From March, he also got information and specimens from his relative William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox</b> who bred poultry and ducks at his rectory in the parish of Delamere, Cheshire.|$|R
2500|$|Especially in the 19th {{century and}} to a lesser extent today, their large size and {{conspicuous}} coloration, as well as the odd morphology of some (e.g. the Lebiini), made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur coleopterologists. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century, a veritable [...] "beetle craze" [...] occurred in England. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles when he was about 20 years old, to the extent that he would rather scour the countryside for rare specimens with William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox,</b> John Stevens Henslow, and Henry Thompson than to study theology as his father wanted him to do. In his autobiography, he fondly recalled his experiences with Licinus and Panagaeus, and wrote: ...|$|R

500|$|Darwin's {{neglect of}} medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican country parson. As Darwin was unqualified for the Tripos, he joined the ordinary degree course in January 1828. He preferred riding and shooting to studying. His cousin William <b>Darwin</b> <b>Fox</b> introduced him to the popular craze for beetle collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow and met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as [...] "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin focused on his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley's Evidences of Christianity (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.|$|R
