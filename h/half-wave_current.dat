The proposed circuit consists of a voltage-to-current converter, a precision current-mode rectifier with operating in class-AB, and two current-to-voltage converters. A voltage input signal is changed into a current signal by the voltage-to-current converter. The class-AB current mode rectifiers rectify these current signals, resulting in positive and negative <b>half-wave</b> <b>current</b> signals that are converted to positive and negative half-wave voltage signals by the current-to-voltage converters. The circuit exhibits low component counts, {{high frequency}} operation, good temperature stability and suitable of IC fabrication. The simulation results are used to verify {{the performance of the}} proposed circuit. Simulated rectifier performance with standard 0. 5 m CMOS technology using! 1. 2 V supply voltage shows the proposed half-wave rectifier circuit provides an operating frequency more than 250 MHz and excellent temperature stability.

40|$|Abstract: The {{resonant}} electromagnetic vibratory conveying drives (EVCD) {{are often}} used to control of the gravimetric flow and dosing of particulate material. The realization of vibration with variable intensity and frequency {{in a wide range}} is achieved by means of suitable power converter and corresponding controller. The range of amplitude oscillation for most EVCD is 0. 1 mm- 100 mm, while the frequency range is 1 Hz- 100 Hz. Today, as the standard output power stages are used thyristors and triacs. Their use implies the phase angle control (PAC). Since the power supply network is fixed frequency, with PAC is only possible to adjust amplitude oscillations of EVCD but not their frequency. With transistor power converter it is possible to achieve sinusoidal or triangular <b>half-wave</b> <b>current</b> of actuator and setting his force. The application of sinusoidal wave includes the current control with a relatively high switching frequency, while the generation of triangular wave is based on the programmed current control at lower frequency. This second method has the significant advantage, since the power losses in the converter are significantly lower. In addition, to adjusting amplitude and time duration of the exciting force provide its frequency control. In this way, operation of EVCD becomes independent of network supply frequency. The paper presented a possible solution low-frequency IGBT switching converter for excitation force control of resonant EVCD...|$|E

This model aids in understanding why similar current peaks occur in arrays of collinear connected dipoles. Index Terms—Connected arrays, dipole arrays, phased arrays, wire scattering.

However, when the dipoles are roughly <b>half-wave,</b> the <b>current</b> on a connected array is peaked, with peaks apart.

40|$|The series {{resonant}} DC/DC converter with {{isolation transformer}} is investigated. When switching frequency of input inverter bridge {{is above the}} resonant one a shortening of the naturally <b>half-waves</b> of <b>current</b> through a L-C resonant circuit takes place resulting in a circulating current through the DC supply source reducing a mean value of supply current and also reducing load voltage in respect to the one at normally resonant case.

50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating <b>current,</b> medium frequency <b>half-wave</b> direct <b>current,</b> or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis of}} the vacuum arc behavior in a pulsed transverse magnetic field with amplitudes up to 120 mT and frequency of 900 Hz {{is presented in the}} paper. The arc was produced between Cu contacts during the switching off operation of the <b>current</b> <b>half-wave</b> of amplitude 500 A and frequency of 30 Hz, so that the circuit parameters had rather moderate values which are easy to obtain in a vacuum switch. The presented results are a part of work which aims to examine the possibilities of using transverse magnetic fields to force a current interruption in vacuum. The analysis was performed using high-speed photography (2000 frames/s) and a shielded Langmuir probe. The results obtained show that the plasma movement and the displacement of the arc in the oscillatory magnetic field proceed according to the Lorentz force acting on ions. This arc displacement is in accordance with the retrograde motion known from the literature, which is opposite to that resulting from the Amperian force. Arc voltage increases of up to about 80 V were observed during the magnetic field action, but the current flow remained undisturbed...|$|R
40|$|Low energy X-ray {{fluorescence}} (XRF) {{and soft}} X-ray absorption (XAS) microspectroscopies at high space-resolution are employed {{for the investigation}} of the coelectrodeposition of composites consisting of a polypyrrole(PPy) -matrix and Mn-based ternary dispersoids, that have been proposed as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen-reduction electrodes. Specifically, we studied Mn–Co–Cu/PP, Mn–Co–Mg/PPy and Mn–Ni–Mg/PPy co-electrodeposits. The Mn–Co–Cu system features the best ORR electrocatalytic activity in terms of electron transfer number, onset potential, <b>half-wave</b> potential and <b>current</b> density. XRF maps and micro-XAS spectra yield compositional and chemical state distributions, contributing unique molecular-level information on the pulse-plating processes. Mn, Ni, Co and Mg exhibit a bimodal distribution consisting of mesoscopic aggregates of micrometric globuli, separated by polymer-rich ridges. Within this common qualitative scenario, the individual systems exhibit quantitatively different chemical distribution patterns, resulting from specific electrokinetic and electrosorption properties of the single components. The electrodeposits consist of Mn 3 +, 4 +-oxide particles, accompanied by combinations of Co 0 /Co 2 +, Ni 0 /Ni 2 + and Cu 0,+/Cu 2 + resulting from the alternance of cathodic and anodic pulses. The formation of highly electroactive Mn 3 +, 4 + in the as-fabricated material is a specific feature of the ternary systems, deriving from synergistic stabilisation brought about by two types of bivalent dopants as well as by galvanic contact to elemental metal; this result represents a considerable improvement in material quality with respect to previously studied Mn/PPy and Mn-based/PPy binaries...|$|R
40|$|Control {{applications}} of switched mode power supplies {{have been widely}} investigated. The main objective ofresearch and development (R&D) in this field is always {{to find the most}} suitable control method to be implemented in various DC/DC converter topologies. Inother words, the goal is to select a control method capable of improving the efficiency of the converter, reducing the effect of disturbances (line and load variation), lessening the effect of EMI (electro magnetic interference), and beingless effected by component variation. The main objective of this research work is to study different control methods implemented in switched mode power supplies namely (PID control, hysteresis control, adaptive control, current programmed control, variable structure control (VSC), and sliding mode control (SMC). The advantages and drawbacks of each control method are given. Two control methods, the PID and the SMC are selected and their effects on DC/DC (Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost) converters are examined. Matlab/SimulinkTM is used to implement PID control method in DC/DC Buck converter and SMC in DC/DC (Buck, and Buck Boost) converters. For the prototype, operational amplifiers (op-amps) are used to implement PID control in DC/DC Buck converter. For SMC op-amps are implemented in DC/DC Buck converter and dSPACETM is used to control the DC/DC Buck-Boost converter. The SMC {{can be applied to the}} DC/DC (Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost) converters. A comparison of the effects of the PID control and the SMC on the DC/DC Buck converter response in steady state, under line variations, load variations, and different component variations is performed. Also the Conducted RF-Emissions between the PID and SMC DC/DC Buck Converter are compared. The thesis shows that, in comparison with the PID control, the SMC provides better steady-state response, better dynamic response, less EMI, inherent order reduction, robustness against system uncertainty disturbances, and an implicit stability proof. Giving a better steady-state and dynamic response, the SMC is implemented in a DC/DC resonant converter. The <b>half-wave</b> zero <b>current</b> switching (HWZCS) DC/DC Buck converter is selected as a converter topology. A general guideline to select the tank component values, needed for the designing of a HWZCS DC/DC Buck, is obtained. The implementation of the SMC to a HWZCS DC/DC Buck converter is analysed.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} a development of the algorithmical means to increase selective operation of differential-phase busbar protection of switchgears of power stations and power grids in off-normal and emergency conditions in case of operation with saturation of current transformers. The paper analyzes the possible current transformer saturation conditions, and the functioning of the differential-phase busbar protection of switchgears in these conditions. According to the results of investigations a common feature for the above conditions was identified by authors. It is a presence of no-current pauses in the secondary circuits of saturated current transformers having some duration which is determined by the conditions and the degree of its saturation. The presence of no-current pauses at the secondary circuits of saturated current transformers for one of the bays that are connected to a common busbar and the lack of these pauses for other bays with unsaturated current transformers can lead to unselective operations of differential-phase busbar protection using the operational algorithm which is based in determining the duration of pauses in the impulse signals created from a <b>half-waves</b> of secondary <b>currents.</b> This feature ware taken as the basis for the development of a functional algorithm of operation of differential-phase busbar protection, the use of which increases the selectivity of the protection in case of a deep saturation of current transformers of one or more bays.

40|$|In {{the present}} work cyclic voltammetric and {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic investigations of fifteen quinones have been carried out. Quinones belong to a class of organic compounds, which find potential applications in biology and chemistry. Five compounds {{from each of the}} three series of quinones, namely benzoquinones (BQs), naphthoquinones (NQs) and anthraquinones (AQs), were selected for the present study. Systematic cyclic voltammetric measurements were made on all compounds in solvents dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile (AN) and propylene carbonate (PC) atn 25 oC. Analysis of the voltammograms provided fundamental electrochemical parameters (redox potentials, peak separation, peak <b>currents,</b> <b>half-wave</b> potential, peak width) which helped in the interpretation of role of solvents, role of structure and the effect of substituents. The redox behaviour of the compounds was examined first within a series and then a comparative analysis of the three series was made. It was found that substituents affect strongly the redox bahaviour of the compounds. The quinones with electron withdrawing groups were easily reduced than those with electron releasing groups. Among the three series the ease of reduction followed the order BQs>NQs>AQs. 2 -Hydroxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone behaved differently due to self protonation. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (ko) of the first and the second reduction steps were determined in the three solvents employing Nicholson and Kochi methods. The experimental results were compared with those calculated theoretically from the modified form of the Marcus theory. The solvent reorganization energy (λo) in the Marcus equation was calculated using the conventional spherical as well as multisphere models. Experimental rate constants in acetonitrile from the Kochi’s method for benzoquinones, naphthoquinones and anthraquinones were found in the range 1. 65 x 10 - 3 – 8. 47 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1, 7. 09 x 10 - 3 – 11. 16 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1, and 0. 19 x 10 - 3 – 7. 10 x 10 - 3 cm s- 1 respectively. The experimentally determined rate constants for quinones were found in close agreement with the theoretically calculated rate constants from the Kochi’s method. The effect of medium on electron transfer rates was rationalized in terms of solvent properties such as polarity, viscosity, density relaxation time. An increase in the solvent polarity and a decrease in viscosity favoured the heterogeneous iii electron transfer rate. Electron transfer rates were found inversely proportional to solvent longitudinal relaxation time. Electrochemical behaviour of quinones was also investigated in the presence of tert-butanol, 2 -propanol, ethanol and methanol (monoalcohols), ethylene glycol (a diol) and glycerol (a triol) as proton donors. The quinone-alcohol interaction was analyzed from changes observed in the shape and peak position of the redox waves in voltammograms as a result of change in concentration of the added alcohol. An estimate of the strength of the quinone-alcohol interaction which is hydrogen bonding in nature was obtained by calculating the thermodynamic association constants and the number of alcohol molecules attached to anion or dianion of quinones. The interaction with dianion was found much stronger than with the anion. The strength of the hydrogen bond depended upon the basicity of the quinone and acidity of the alcohol. The presence of α- hydrogens in the quinone structure strengthened the interaction. A comparison of the results for monoalcohols, diol and triol shows that the polyalcohols formed stronger hydrogen bonds. The strength of interaction increased with {{the increase in the number}} of OH groups. Homogeneous electron transfer rate constants of quinones in acetonitrile were determined from ESR spectroscopic measurements at 298 K. The anion radical of the quinone was generated in situ in a locally fabricated esr-electrochemical cell and the hyperfine spectrum recorded. The hyperfine coupling constants and the line widths were determined from the experimental and simulated ESR spectra. The electron self exchange rate constant was determined from the concentration depended chemical line broadening produced by the addition of neutral quinone. The rate constants were found in the range of 5. 2 x 108 - 4. 4 x 109 M- 1 s- 1. The strength of precursor complex is observed in terms of association constants (KA) calculated from the experimental electron transfer rate constants are in the range 0. 028 – 1. 023 M- 1. Theoretical values of KA were calculated using Eigen-Fuoss and reaction zone models. The values calculated with the reaction zone model agreed with the experimentally determined values. The ESR results support the observed trends in electrochemical behaviour of quinones...|$|R
