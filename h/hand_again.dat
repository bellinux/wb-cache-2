5|$|Oleśnicki {{gained the}} upper <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> and pursued his {{long-term}} objective of Poland's union with Hungary. At that time, the Ottoman Empire {{embarked on a}} fresh round of European conquests and threatened Hungary, which needed {{the assistance of the}} powerful Polish–Lithuanian ally. In 1440, Władysław III assumed the Hungarian throne. Influenced by Julian Cesarini, the young king led the Hungarian army against the Ottomans in 1443 and again in 1444. Like Cesarini, Władysław III was killed at the Battle of Varna.|$|E

25|$|The channel tried its <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> at live {{programming}} {{with the}} premiere of a half-hour program called The Seven in September 2010. The program counted down seven entertainment-related stories of interest to viewers (and included some interview segments among them), having aired weekdays at 5pm with a weekend wrap-up at 10am ET. Shortly after its debut, the show was slightly retooled as it dropped co-host Julie Alexandria but kept fellow co-host Kevin Manno; the Saturday recap show was eliminated as well. The Seven was cancelled on June 13, 2011. Manno's only assignment at MTV post-Seven was conducting {{an interview with a}} band which only aired on MTV.com. Manno is no longer employed with MTV and has since appeared as an occasional correspondent on the LXTV-produced NBC series 1st Look.|$|E

500|$|The issue {{concerned}} <b>Hand</b> <b>again</b> {{during the}} New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck {{down in this}} way. He viewed it as a judicial [...] "usurpation" [...] for the Supreme Court to {{assume the role of}} a third chamber in these cases. As far as he was concerned, the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.|$|E
2500|$|Hooker's {{response}} encouraging publication {{was welcomed}} by Darwin, who thought his suggestion [...] "that the Essay might supersede & take away all novelty & value from my future larger Book, is very true; & that would grieve me beyond everything. On the other <b>hand,</b> (<b>again</b> from Lyell’s urgent advice) I published a preliminary sketch of Coral Theory & this did neither good nor harm.— I begin most heartily to wish that Lyell had never put {{this idea of}} an Essay into my head." [...] On 14 May 1856 Darwin noted in his journal that he had begun his [...] "species sketch".|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, Franck {{tried his}} <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> at another opera, Ghiselle. [...] It was more sketched out than {{composed}} and Franck never completed it. In contrast, a massive String Quartet was completed and performed in April 1890, and was well received by public and critics. [...] There had been other recent successes, {{including his own}} performances as concert pianist in and around Paris, an enthusiastic reception of a revival of Psyché {{of a couple of}} years earlier, and performances of works by various of his pupils. [...] In addition, he was still playing Sunday improvisations to usually large congregations at Sainte-Clotilde. [...] He had in mind major works for organ and possibly a cello sonata.|$|E

2500|$|Apart from housing design, {{the period}} of Nordic Classicism is {{regarded}} as being fairly brief, surpassed by the more [...] "continental" [...] style - especially in banks and other office buildings - typified by Frosterus and Pauli E. Blomstedt (e.g. Liittopankki bank building, Helsinki, 1929). In reality, however, a synthesis of elements from various styles emerged. Nevertheless, but by the late 1920s and early 1930s there was already a significant move towards Functionalism, inspired most significantly by French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier, but also from examples closer to <b>hand,</b> <b>again</b> Sweden, such as the Stockholm Exhibition (1930) by Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. However, at the time, there were certainly architects who attempted to articulate their dissatisfaction with static styles, just as Sigurd Frosterus and Gustaf Strengel had criticised the National Romanticism. Pauli E. Blomstedt, who had certainly designed significant buildings in the Nordic Classicism style, then became a vehement critic, writing sarcastically in a 1928 essay [...] "Architectural Anemia" [...] about Nordic Classicism's sense of [...] "good taste", {{at a time when}} he had already endorsed the white Functionalism: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sulpicius Severus' Vita of Martin of Tours relates how Martin {{encountered}} a peasant funeral, carrying {{the body in}} a winding sheet, which Martin mistook for some druidic rites of sacrifice, [...] "because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of demons veiled with a white covering." [...] So Martin halted the procession by raising his pectoral cross: [...] "Upon this, the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavoured, with every possible effort, to move forward, but {{were not able to}} take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight, they set down the dead body." [...] Then discovering his error, Martin raised his <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> to let them proceed: [...] "Thus," [...] the hagiographer points out, [...] "he both compelled them to stand when he pleased, and permitted them to depart when he thought good." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opposition}} of the Senate, while it was more vocal than serious, was distinctly detrimental to Rivers's efforts since any assistance to his work was very sparingly granted. It was not until 1901, eight years after his appointment, that he was allowed {{the use of a}} small cottage for the laboratory, and given thirty-five pounds annually (later, and somewhat begrudgingly, increased to fifty) for purchase and upkeep of equipment. [...] For several years Rivers continued thus, and then, stimulated by him and others, the Moral Science Board stretched out a rather timid and tentative <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> and, in 1903, Rivers and his assistants and students moved to another small building in St Tibbs Row. These working spaces were characterised as being [...] "dismal", [...] "damp, dark and ill-ventilated" [...] but these poor working conditions did not seem to dishearten the Cambridge psychologists. Indeed, the effect was quite the contrary, psychology began to thrive: [...] "perhaps, {{in the early days of}} scientific progress, a subject often grows all the more surely if its workers have to meet difficulties, improvise their apparatus, and rub very close shoulders one with another." [...] It was not until 1912 that a well-equipped laboratory was built under the directorship of Charles S. Myers, one of Rivers's earliest and ablest pupils, who was wealthy and able to supplement the University grant with his own funds.|$|E

2500|$|Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) {{are going}} through Regina's stores of potions in her vault and cannot find {{something}} that will unfreeze Marian. [...] Henry surmises that Robin Hood is {{still in love with}} Regina because true love's kiss did not unfreeze her. Regina says that this time Henry may be too young to fully understand everything. Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left <b>hand</b> <b>again</b> acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about. Hook states he will do whatever it takes and Mr. Gold says that he loves it when people say that. He tells Hook to meet him on the docks in the morning.|$|E
