We assessed the reliability of such findings in chronic low back pain patients who were accepted candidates for disc prosthesis. Methods: On pretreatment MRI of 170 patients (mean age 41 years; 88 women), three experienced radiologists independently rated Modic changes, disc findings and <b>facet</b> arthropathy at <b>L</b> 3 /L 4, L 4 /L 5 and L 5 /S 1. Two radiologists rerated 126 examinations. For each MRI finding at each disc level, agreement was analysed using the kappa statistic and differences in prevalence across observers using a fixed effects model. Results: All findings at L 3 /L 4 and <b>facet</b> arthropathy at <b>L</b> 5 /S 1 had a mean prevalence < 10 % across observers and were not further analysed, ensuring interpretable kappa values. Overall interobserver agreement was generally moderate or good (kappa 0. 40 – 0. 77) at L 4 –S 1 for Modic changes, nucleus pulposus signal, disc height (subjective and measured), posterior high-intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour, and fair (kappa 0. 24) at L 4 /L 5 for facet arthropathy. Posterior HIZ at L 5 /S 1 and severely reduced subjective disc height at L 4 /L 5 differed up to threefold in prevalence between observers (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Vocabulary {{knowledge}} {{is the basis}} of language ability. For learners, increasing the number of words and phrases they know {{is the most important thing}} they can do to improve their ability. However, lexical competence involves much more than simply memorizing long lists. All words have various aspects of knowledge. Some examples are syntactic and semantic behavior, derivations, active and passive knowledge, collocations and the network of associations and knowledge of polysemy. (e. g. Richards, 1976; Melka, 1997) However, for a typical inter-mediate learner who knows several thousand head words, assessing the overall state of her vocabulary knowledge would be impossible if all these aspects were taken into account. Understandably, teachers often rely on one-time vocabulary tests of L 2 -L 1 translation knowledge. But since such tests constitute only a tiny fraction of known words and target only one facet of knowledge, they reveal little about the overall state of lexical development. Moreover, the development of lexical competence is not linear or monotonic. It progresses in spurts and regresses with disuse, as any committed language learner has experienced. Clearly, sensitive, practical testing tools are needed to assess the various <b>facets</b> of <b>L</b> 2 lexical ability. This paper will deal with the testing of L 2 word recognition ability...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} {{for the purpose of}} validating a Writing Apprehension Questionnaire (WAQ) that was developed for use in a doctoral study. The WAQ used items adapted from existing writing anxiety scales, which include the Daly-Miller Writing Apprehension Test (WAT, Daly & Miller, 1975 a), Second Language WAT (Gungle & Taylor, 1989) and Second Language Writing Apprehension Inventory (SLWAI, Cheng, 2004). The pilot test was conducted with 474 ESL students and Exploratory Factor analysis was employed to ascertain the multidimensional conceptualisation of the writing anxiety construct and to determine the final make-up of the WAQ. Specifically, the Principle Component Analysis extraction method was performed to examine the factor structure of the initial 38 -item WAQ. Repeated analyses were conducted and comparisons of the outputs were carried out with the aim of determining the number of factors to retain. The results of the analyses indicated that the scale has 32 items with four factors, i. e. Negative experience/belief about writing, Concern about form/content, Positive experience with writing, and Fear of evaluation. The reliability analyses demonstrated that the total scale and its subscales had good internal consistency reliability. Thus, this pilot study confirms the multidimensionality of the scale, which makes it appropriate for the investigation into the relationships between the different <b>facets</b> of <b>L</b> 2 writing apprehension and aspects of writing performance as set out in the main doctoral study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} sacralization of L 5 on radiological {{studies of}} degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 4 -L 5. Overview of Literature: Degenerative spondylolisthesis commonly develops at L 4 -L 5. Sacralization of L 5 {{is thought to}} cause stress concentration at this level, which accentuates degenerative changes and promotes development of degenerative spondylolisthesis. However, {{there has been no}} study dedicated to determining whether the presence of sacralization at L 5 influences the radiological findings in degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 4 -L 5. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 4 -L 5 were classified into two groups according to the presence of L 5 sacralization: with (n= 54) and without (n= 24). Four radiographic parameters were measured and compared between the two groups: anterior slippage of L 4 on L 5 (% slip), <b>facet</b> orientation of <b>L</b> 4 -L 5 (degrees), <b>facet</b> osteoarthritis of <b>L</b> 4 -L 5 by Fujiwara’s criteria (1 � 4 grades), and disc degeneration of L 4 -L 5 by Frymoyer’s criteria (grades 1 � 5). Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the degree of anterior slippage of L 4 on L 5 (17. 02 ± 6. 21 versus 16. 65 ± 4. 87, p= 0. 809), facet orientation (54. 99 ± 12. 18 versus 56. 23 ± 4. 35, p= 0. 642), facet osteoarthritis (3. 43 ± 0. 59 versus 3. 53 ± 0. 37, p= 0. 527), or disc degeneration (4. 50 ± 0. 51 versus 4. 35 ± 0. 61, p= 0. 340) between the two groups. Conclusions: Our study shows that the influence of sacralization of L 5 on radiological findings in degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 4 -L 5 may be less significant than previously expected. Further studies in large patient groups are needed to clarify the role of L 5 sacralization on the development of degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 4 -L 5.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritic (OA) {{degeneration}} of the lumbar facet joints {{has been}} implicated in low back pain. This study was undertaken to investigate the biologic links between cellular and structural alterations within facet joint components {{and the development of}} symptomatic chronic back pain. METHODS: We generated an animal model of facet joint degeneration by intraarticular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into <b>facet</b> joints (<b>L</b> 3 -L 4, L 4 -L 5, L 5 -L 6) of Sprague-Dawley rats. Pain sensation due to pressure, which mimics a mechanical stimulus for facet joint injury, was measured using an algometer. Pain response was also assessed in a straight leg raising test. Cartilage alterations were assessed by biochemical evaluation and microfocal computed tomography (micro-CT). Therapeutic modulation of chronic facet joint pain with the use of various pharmacologic agents was investigated. RESULTS: MIA injection resulted in severely damaged facet joint cartilage, proteoglycan loss, and alterations of subchondral bone structure. Micro-CT analyses suggested that the behavioral hyperalgesia from facet joint degeneration was not associated with foraminal stenosis. The biologic and structural changes in facet joints were closely associated with sustained and robust chronic pain. Morphine and pregabalin markedly alleviated pressure hyperalgesia, while celecoxib (a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 [COX- 2]) produced moderate antihyperalgesic effects and the effect of ketorolac (an inhibitor of COX- 1 and COX- 2) was negligible. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that MIA injection provides a useful model for the study of OA changes in the facet joint and indicate that facet joint degeneration is a major cause of chronic low back pain. The treatment results suggest that classes of drugs that are widely used to treat OA, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, may have limited efficacy once joint destruction is complete...|$|R

To reduce the risk from ionizing radiation, {{it is essential to}} minimize radiation dose. This prospective study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness in reducing radiation dose during facet joint injection in the lumbar spine and to evaluate the feasibility and possibilities of the new real time image guidance system SabreSource™. A total of 60 patients, treated with a standardized injection therapy of the <b>facet</b> joints <b>L</b> 4 –L 5 or L 5 –S 1, were included in this study. A total of 30 patients were treated by fluoroscopy guidance alone, the following 30 patients were treated using the new SabreSource™ system. Thus a total of 120 injections to the facet joints were performed. Pain, according to the visual analogue scale (VAS), was documented before and 6  h after the intervention. Radiation dose, time of radiation and the number of exposures needed to place the needle were recorded. No significant differences concerning age (mean age 60. 5  years, range 51 – 69), body mass index (mean BMI 26. 2, range 22. 2 – 29. 9) and preoperative pain (VAS 7. 9, range 6 – 10) were found between the two groups. There was no difference in pain reduction between the two groups (60 vs. 61. 5 %; P =  0. 001) but the radiation dose was significantly smaller with the new SabreSource™ system (reduction of radiation dose 32. 7 %, P =  0. 01; reduction of mean entrance surface dose 32. 3 %, P =  0. 01). The SabreSource™ System significantly reduced the radiation dose received during the injection therapy of the lumbar facet joints.

40|$|Owing to its completeness, the 1. 5 million {{year old}} Nariokotome boy {{skeleton}} KNM-WT 15000 is central for understanding skeletal biology of Homo erectus. Nevertheless, since Latimer and Ohman (2001, Axial dysplasia in Homo erectus. J Hum Evol 40 :A 12) reported on asymmetries and distortions of Nariokotome boy’s axial skeleton suggesting adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, possibly associated with congenital skeletal dysplasia, it is questionable whether it still {{can be used}} as reference for Homo erectus. Recently, however, the presence of skeletal dysplasia has been refuted. Here, we present a morphologic and morphometric reanalysis of the assertion of idiopathic scoliosis. We demonstrate that unarticulated vertebral columns of non-scoliotic and scoliotic individuals can be distinguished based on the lateral deviation of the spinous process, lateral and sagittal wedging, vertebral body torsion, pedicle thickness asymmetry and asymmetry of the superior and inferior articular facet area. A principal component analysis of the overall asymmetry of all seven vertebral shape variables groups KNM-WT 15000 within non-scoliotic modern humans. An anomaly of vertebrae T 1 -T 2 is compatible with a short left convex curve at the uppermost thoracic region, possibly due to injury or local growth dysbalance. Asymmetries of the <b>facet</b> joints <b>L</b> 3 -L 5 suggest a local right convex curve in the lower lumbar region that probably resulted from juvenile traumatic disc herniation. This pattern is incompatible with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis or other types of scoliosis, including congenital, neuromuscular or syndromic scoliosis. It is, however, consistent with a recent reanalysis of the rib cage that did not reveal any asymmetry. Except for these possibly trauma-related anomalies, the Nariokotome boy fossil therefore seems to belong to a normal Homo erectus youth without evidence for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis or other severe pathologies of the axial skeleton...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{perform a}} {{combined}} (retrospective and prospective) study to further characterize hypoplastic L 5, its correlation with spondylolysis and other associated abnormalities on routine Computed tomography and {{magnetic resonance imaging}}. MethodsWe studied the Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images of 29 patients with hypoplasia and posterior wedging of L 5 with bilateral spondylolysis at L 5. These cases were followed up retrospectively and prospectively. The anteroposterior diameter of L 4, L 5 and S 1 was calculated and compared. The percentage of posterior wedging of L 5 was calculated. Anterolisthesis, hypoplastic pedicle, <b>facet</b> joints, <b>L</b> 4 – 5 and L 5 –S 1 intervertebral discs, nerve roots and fragmentation of pars interarticularis were also studied. ResultsThe mean difference of anteroposterior diameter between L 4 and L 5 was 2. 75 mm and of L 5 and S 1 was 3. 78 mm. The mean percentage of posterior wedging was 31 %. Grade I anterolisthesis was present in 13 patients and grade II in 2 patients. Facet joint arthropathy was seen in 20 patients. In 24 patients, there was hypoplastic pedicle. Pars fragmentation was seen in 7 patients. L 5 –S 1 disc disease was seen in 21 patients out of whom 8 had exiting nerve root compression. L 4 –L 5 disc disease was seen in 10 patients of whom 5 had exiting nerve root compression. ConclusionsHypoplastic L 5 is a strong predictor of bilateral spondylolysis {{even in the absence}} of true anterior slippage. True anterior slippage and disproportionate adjacent disc disease result in varying degrees of exiting nerve root compression. Advances in knowledgeL 5 hypoplasia can simulate anterolisthesis and can predict the bilateral spondylolysis. L 5 hypoplasia can lead to early disc disease...|$|R
40|$|The PrfA protein of Listeria monocytogenes {{functions}} as a key regulatory factor for the coordinated expression of many virulence genes during bacterial infection of host cells. PrfA activity is controlled by multiple regulatory mechanisms, including an apparent requirement for either {{the presence of a}} cofactor or some form of posttranslational modification that regulates the activation of PrfA. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel PrfA mutation that results in constitutive activation of the PrfA protein. The PrfA L 140 F mutation was found to confer high-level expression of PrfA-regulated genes and to be functionally dominant over the wild-type allele. The presence of the PrfA L 140 F mutation resulted in the aggregation of L. monocytogenes in broth culture and, unlike previously described prfA mutations, appeared to be slightly toxic to the bacteria. High-level PrfA-dependent gene expression showed no additional increase in L. monocytogenes strains containing an additional copy of prfA L 140 F despite a > 4 -fold increase in PrfA protein levels. In contrast, the introduction of multiple copies of the wild-type prfA allele to L. monocytogenes resulted in a corresponding increase in PrfA-dependent gene expression, although overall expression levels remained far below those observed for PrfA L 140 F strains. These results suggest a hierarchy of PrfA regulation, such that the relative levels of PrfA protein present within the cell correlate with the levels of PrfA-dependent gene expression when the protein is not in its fully activated state; however, saturating levels of the protein are then quickly reached when PrfA is converted to its active form. Regulation of the PrfA activation status must be an important <b>facet</b> of <b>L.</b> monocytogenes survival, as mutations that result in constitutive PrfA activation may have deleterious consequences for bacterial physiology...|$|R

The clinical and pathologic appearance of myositis ossifi-cans varies depending on the time elapsed after heterotopic bone formation.

This paper reports a 63 -year-old male who sustained a 1 -week history of radiating pain to both lower extremities combined with lower back pain.

In this paper, we consider that problem from a polyhedral point of view. We give an integer programming formulation for the problem when L = 2, 3. An extension of this result to the more general case where the number of required paths is arbitrary and L = 2, 3 is also given. We discuss the associated polytope, P(G, L), for L = 2, 3. In particular, we show in this case that the linear relaxation of P(G, L), Q(G, L), given by the trivial, the st-cut, and the so-called L-path-cut inequalities, is integral. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial time cutting plane algorithm for the problem when L = 2, 3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{describe}} a new posterior minimally invasive method of facet stabilization for treatment of the degenerating lumbar motion segment. The biomechanics of this Percudyn (Interventional Spine; Irvine, CA) system are distinct from that of other interspinous dynamic stabilization systems as it acts bilaterally directly within the middle column of the spine. Based on biomechanical evalution, the paired prosthesis supports, cushions, and reinforces the facet complexes by limiting both extension and lateral bending thereby maintaining central and foraminal volumes. METHODS: the Percudyn device consists of a pedicle anchor upon which sits a cushioning polycarbonate-urethane stabilizer {{that serves as a}} mechanically reinforcing stop between the inferior and superior articular facets. A 1. 5 cm skin incision is made bilaterally over the lower pedicle of the treated segment through which a Jamshidi needle is percutaneously targeted under biplanar fluoroscopic guidance into the caudal aspect of the superior articular process directly underneath the lip of the inferior facet from the level above. Progressive onestep tubular dilation is then performed to secure a small disposable working portal. Through this access, the Percudyn stabilizers are then placed over the wire and anchored bilaterally into the inferior pedicles of the degenerated motion segment. RESULTS: three patients (ages 26 - 41, male) with significant low back pain as well as radiculopathy with lateral recess stenosis from a large disc herniation/ ligamentum and <b>facet</b> hypertrophy (<b>L</b> 4 - 5 and/or L 5 -S 1) underwent a minimally invasive decompression/ discectomy and bilateral Percudyn placement at each disease level. Each patient had significant relief of both his radiculopathy and axial back pain post-operatively and was discharged home within 18 hours without sequelae. CONCLUSION: this novel technique of percutaneous posterior facet augmentation allows for safe placement of bilateral middle column prostheses that act as mechanical cushions between the articulating facets thereby limiting extension and lateral bending and also preventing compression of the neural elements. As the Percudyn device serves to reinforce the middle column directly {{at the level of the}} facet, it represents a new class of posterior motionpreserving stabilization which may serve to mitigate segmental axial back pain as has been described for other posterior dynamic stabilization systems...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative {{intracellular}} {{bacterial pathogen}} that causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and neonates. Bacterial virulence is {{mediated by the}} expression of specific gene products that facilitate entry into host cells and enable bacterial replication; {{the majority of these}} gene products are regulated by a transcriptional activator known as PrfA. L. monocytogenes strains containing prfA E 77 K or prfA G 155 S mutations exhibit increased expression of virulence genes in broth culture and are hypervirulent in mice. To define the scope of the influences of the prfA E 77 K and prfA G 155 S mutations on L. monocytogenes pathogenesis, multiple aspects of bacterial invasion and intracellular growth were examined. Enhanced bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells was dependent on the expression of a number of surface proteins previously associated with invasion, including InlA, InlB, and ActA. In addition to these surface proteins, increased production of the hly-encoded secreted hemolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) was also found to significantly enhance bacterial invasion into epithelial cell lines for both prfA mutant strains. Although prfA E 77 K and prfA G 155 S strains were similar in their invasive phenotypes, the infection of epithelial cells with prfA E 77 K strains resulted in host cell plasma membrane damage, whereas prfA G 155 S strains did not alter plasma membrane integrity. Bacterial infection of human epithelial cells, in which the production of LLO is not required for bacterial entry into the cytosol, indicated that prfA E 77 K cytotoxic effects were mediated via LLO. Both prfA E 77 K and prfA G 155 S strains were more efficient than wild-type bacteria in gaining access to the host cell cytosol and in initiating the polymerization of host cell actin, and both were capable of mediating LLO-independent lysis of host cell vacuoles in cell lines for which L. monocytogenes vacuole disruption normally requires LLO activity. These experiments illuminate the diverse <b>facets</b> of <b>L.</b> monocytogenes pathogenesis that are significantly enhanced by the constitutive activation of PrfA via prfA mutations and underscore the critical role of this protein in promoting L. monocytogenes virulence...|$|R

The oscillating spectrum was defined by the Fabry-Perot modes of the uncoated SOA whose free spectral range was 65 GHz. At the output of the ring laser a I S m m SOA was used for amplification and a fiber Fabry-Perot for individual channel isolation and detection in an optical or electrical spectrum analyzer. Multi-wavelength operation is possible even by iising the reflection coated SOA alone considered as a linear, 500 um long, cavity, providing lasing lines determined by the Fabry-Perot modes that experience the highest gain. However, due to gain compression caused by the extreme low cavity losses, its performance as a multi...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the significance of}} facet joint arthropathy (FJA) {{and the role of}} discopathy in chronic mechanical lower back pain (CMLBP). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 732 patients with CMLBP who were treated between 1997 and 2007. All patients had received injections of methylprednisolone and bupivacaine into the <b>facet</b> joints of <b>L</b> 3 - 4, L 4 - 5, and L 5 -S 1. None had tumor, infection, or major trauma causing fracture of the spine, disruption of the major ligaments of the lumbosacral spine, or cauda equina syndrome. Patients were evaluated in the recovery room before discharge, 1 week after the procedure, and until the pain recurred. Charts were reviewed to evaluate the efficacy of facet joint injection (FJI) and the relevance of the CMLBP to FJA. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were reviewed for each patient to {{determine the}} role of discopathy in the outcomes of the patients who had had FJI. RESULTS: The overall success rate was 73. 2 %, with a mean duration of efficacy of 77. 9 days. In patients with PSE factors, the success rate was 67. 9 % with a mean duration of efficacy of 70. 3 days. In those without PSE factors, the favorable initial response to FJI was 86. 8 %, with a mean duration of efficacy of 88. 6 days. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that FJA {{plays a major role in}} triggering CMLBP.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthrosis is {{a common}} cause of low back pain. The {{diagnosis}} is clinical and can be confirmed by imaging studies. Pain treatment and confirmation of diagnosis are made by intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and by local anesthetic use, due to clinical improvement. A direct monitoring of the procedure can be done under fluoroscopy, a classic technique, or else by an ultrasound-guided procedure. CASE REPORT: Female patient, 88 years old, 1. 68 m and 72 kg, with <b>facet</b> osteoarthrosis at <b>L</b> 2 -L 3, L 3 -L 4 and L 4 -L 5 for two years. On physical examination, she exhibited pain on lateralization and spinal extension. We opted {{in favor of an}} ultrasound-guided facet joint block. A midline spinal longitudinal scan was obtained, with identification of the desired joint space at L 3 -L 4. A 25 G needle was inserted into the skin by the echographic off-plane ultrasound technique. 1 mL of contrast was administered, with confirmation by fluoroscopy. After aspiration of the contrast, 1 mL of solution containing 0. 25 % bupivacaine hydrochloride and 10 mg of methylprednisolone acetate was injected. Injections into L 3 -L 4, L 2 -L 3 and L 1 -L 2 to the right were applied. CONCLUSIONS: The visualization of the facet joint by ultrasound involves minimal risk, besides reduction of radiation. This option is suitable for {{a large part of the}} population. However, fluoroscopy and computed tomography remain as monitoring techniques indicated for patients with specific characteristics, such as obesity, severe degenerative diseases and anatomical malformations, in which the ultrasound technique is still in need of further study...|$|R
40|$|Oral Presentations: Session: Spine. Abstract no. 21855 - [URL] Facet joints are {{important}} in accommodating spinal motion and maintaining spinal integrity. It is believed that the anatomy and biomechanical behavior of the joints vary along the lumbar spine. The objective of current study is to develop an experimental method for tracking the in vitro facet joint motions with a motion analysis system. METHODS: Biomechanical tests were conducted on a human cadaveric lumbar spine specimen to study the facet joint kinematics. Pure moment of ± 7. 5 Nm was applied by MTS spine loading fixture to simulate the principal spinal motions. By using a commercial motion analysis system, the three-dimensional rotations and displacements of the <b>facet</b> joints at <b>L</b> 3 -L 4 and L 4 -L 5 levels were measured and calculated. RESULTS: Under flexionextension, the L 3 -L 4 and L 4 -L 5 facet joint rotations and displacements had maximum values of 1. 47 º and 3. 78 º, and 0. 88 mm and 1. 27 mm, respectively. It {{was found that the}} two sides showed similar values in both parameters. Similar results in the motion pattern were obtained for lateral bending. However, under axial rotation, there was an asymmetric behavior in the facet joint motions between right and left sides at the two levels, showing larger rotations on the right facets. DISCUSSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates the in vitro kinematics study of the lumbar facet joints and further investigation will be conducted with larger sample size. To study the relationship between the joint bio mechanics and anatomical structures, facet joint orientation and geometry are to be correlated with the motion data at different spinal levels.

40|$|Within the {{research}} project “Determinanten der Lesekompetenz (DELKO) ” (Determinants of Reading Comprehension), three studies {{were carried out}} to investigate linguistic determinants of listening comprehension as well as the effects of listening comprehension on reading competencies in first-language (L 1) and second-language (L 2) students. The studies aimed at analyzing the specific challenges students encounter in second-language listening. Furthermore, the separability and peculiarity of academic and everyday listening competencies in L 1 and L 2 students was tested empirically. 	Results from the first study indicate that listening comprehension in L 1 and L 2 adolescents is influenced by the same set of linguistic determinants, but that L 2 students show weaker listening comprehension skills than their L 1 peers. For all language groups, vocabulary and morpho-syntactic knowledge, i. e. determinants that are needed to generate a mental representation of a listening texts’ gist, had a strong impact on students’ listening skills. At the same time, especially L 2 students with Turkish as a first language exhibited poorer performance than L 1 students on measures of these determinants. Study 2 shows that performance differences between L 1 students and L 2 students who speak another language than Turkish as a first language mainly result from the lower socioeconomic background of the latter group. For L 2 students with Turkish as a first language, however, performance disadvantages persist even after controlling for students’ socioeconomic status. As listening comprehension is strongly associated with reading comprehension in all language groups, these performance disadvantages may also impact L 2 students’ reading skills. 	Study 3 shows that L 2 adolescents exhibit weaker academic as well as everyday listening skills compared to their L 1 peers. Contrary to what was expected, the performance differences were more pronounced for students’ everyday listening comprehension. Based on these results, study four explores the impact of academic and everyday vocabulary on listening comprehension. Findings indicate that L 1 and L 2 students differ more strongly in terms of everyday vocabulary than in academic vocabulary. These results may possibly explained by the differing exposure L 2 students have to the respective <b>facets</b> of <b>L</b> 2 vocabulary. 	The studies point out that the same set of linguistic determinants has effects on L 1 students’ and L 2 students’ listening comprehension while especially L 2 students with Turkish as a first language exhibit persistent weaknesses in terms of these determinants. The poorer performance of L 2 students not only pertains to their academic listening skills, but also to their everyday listening skills which teachers often assume to be well developed. The implications of these results for educational practice, especially in terms of fostering students’ listening comprehension skills, as well as for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Gram {{positive}} facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is both {{ubiquitous in}} the environment and is a facultative intracellular pathogen. A high degree of adaptability to different growth niches is {{one reason for the}} success of this organism. In this dissertation, two <b>facets</b> of <b>L.</b> monocytogenes, growth and gene expression have been investigated. The first portion examines the function and necessity of the nucleotide second messenger c-di-AMP, and the second portion of this dissertation examines the signal transduction network required for virulence gene regulation. Through previous genetic screens and biochemical analysis {{it was found that the}} nucleotide second messenger cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is secreted by the bacterium during intracellular and extracellular growth. Depletion of c-di-AMP levels in L. monocytogenes and related bacteria results in sensitivity to cell wall acting antibiotics such as cefuroxime, decreased growth rate, and decreased virulence. We devised a variety of bacterial genetic screens to identify the function of this molecule in bacterial physiology. The sole di-adenylate cyclase (encoded by dacA) responsible for catalyzing synthesis of c-di-AMP in L. monocytogenes could not be deleted by conventional methods. However, ∆dacA mutants could be obtained by flanking dacA with loxP sites and expressing the site-specific recombinase Cre. All of the ∆dacA mutants generated by this novel method on conventional medium harbored suppressor mutations that bypassed the essential functions of c-di-AMP in multiple ways. Characterization of ∆dacA suppressor mutations revealed cross-talk between c-di-AMP and (p) ppGpp, another nucleotide second messenger that slows growth in response to amino acid starvation as part of the stringent response. Depletion of c-di-AMP in rich media resulted in an increase in (p) ppGpp, which was toxic to the bacterium. Whereas (p) ppGpp is essential for growth in nutrient poor synthetic medium, c-di-AMP was found to be essential only in rich medium and genome sequencing of ∆dacA mutants constructed in synthetic medium revealed no suppressor mutations. Synthetic medium thus provided a tool for generating ∆dacA mutants in combination with targeted mutations identified from our suppressor analysis. These mutants were further analyzed for growth in rich medium or resistance to cefuroxime. Suppressor mutations in the oligopeptide permease and glycine betaine osmolyte importer showed that peptides from rich medium were toxic to ∆dacA mutants due to a dysregulation of osmotic pressure. These defects in osmotic pressure could be overcome by addition of salt to the medium, which allowed for recovery of ∆dacA on rich medium and ameliorated sensitivity of ∆dacA to cefuroxime. To identify how c-di-AMP regulated intracellular osmotic pressure, we screened for suppressor mutations that overcome growth on rich media and cefuroxime resistance. Suppressor mutations from this screen indicated that c-di-AMP inhibits pyruvate carboxylase in order to limit carbon flux into the TCA cycle when acetyl-CoA levels are high. Increased flux through the TCA cycle was only toxic when citrate synthase was present, implying that accumulation of citrate is toxic to ∆dacA mutants. These findings demonstrate a role of c-di-AMP in balancing central metabolism and TCA cycle intermediates for optimal growth on rich media, resistance to cefuroxime, and virulence...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates different <b>facets</b> of E. <b>L.</b> T. in Brazil as {{seen through}} the eyes of learners of English (pupils and student-teachers) and their teachers in the State of Parani. Terms of reference have been defined so as to concentrate this study on the analysis of the attitudes of teachers and pupils and their possible correlation with a complex of potentially influential factors - such as official policies, professional, pedagogic, social, economic and cultural factors, etc. - in an attempt to throw light on the reasons for the poor standards of E. L. T. in that country. The findings of this investigation indicate that the major reasons for this state of affairs are, according to the teachers themselves: their lack of proper training; the small number of English lessons per week; the 1971 Educational Reform itself; lack of a relevant and integrated syllabus, and of appropriate teaching resources; pupils' lack of exposure to English; and, above all, the teachers' excessive workload, which prevents adequate lesson-preparation or attention to individual pupils. Other findings related to teacher-training, and specifically to shortcomings in the training of L. F. L. teachers - many of whom are revealed as lacking a good command of the target language and even of the rudimentary skills of E. L. T. - and the major reasons for this. The three populations of this study showed themselves quite open towards English culture and civilisation, and strong evidence is presented to suggest that pupils, influenced by the importance English has achieved in the modern world, by its wide popularity with the young, and by consideration for their own careers, recognise a need for English. The interrelations of these attitudes {{with a wide range of}} factors from the pupils' backgrounds were also explored. Evidence was also forthcoming that despite such positive attitudes, pupils found their English lessons boring. Investigation linked this with the unsuitability of the materials used and, above all, with the stark discontinuities between the pupils' goals and interests, which centre around communicative skills, and those of their teachers, concentrating on grammar and reading. Some suggestions are offered towards defining a policy for E. L. T. in Brazil, the writing of a syllabus which will capitalise on the attitudes and forms of motivation identified by this study, and on strategies for the training and re-training of teachers...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWeakness of the gluteal muscles {{has been}} {{associated}} with altered lower extremity biomechanics, but the link between diminished hip muscle performance and the lumbopelvic region has not been convincingly established. The objectives outlined in this dissertation were developed to elucidate the effects of diminished hip muscle performance on lumbopelvic kinematics. To accomplish the objectives, experimentations utilizing in-vitro human cadaver lumbosacral spinal specimens and in-vivo lumbopelvic mechanics via three-dimensional motion analysis were conducted.; The purpose of the in-vivo experiment (study # 1) was to test the hypotheses that women with diminished hip extensor and hip abductor muscle performance will demonstrate greater rate and range of lumbopelvic motion as well as greater lumbopelvic muscle activity during a single-leg landing task when compared to subjects with stronger hip muscle performance. When compared to individuals with greater hip muscle strength, individuals with diminished muscle strength demonstrated increased lumbopelvic muscle activation, in addition to the greater rate and range of lumbopelvic motion. These findings indicate those with diminished hip muscle performance utilize a different neuromuscular control strategy which further supports the notion of increased spinal loading in weaker individuals.; The purpose of the in-vitro experiment (study # 2) was to test the hypothesis that the lumbar facet joint and intervertebral disc will experience greater loading with simulated combined frontal and transverse plane motion than motion in any of the anatomic planes. Loads on the L 4 -L 5 <b>facet</b> joint and <b>L</b> 4 intervertebral disc were measured under pure moments and simulated frontal plane pelvic obliquity loading conditions. Results of this study showed facet force was highest in combined loading conditions, whereas there was no increase in intradiscal pressure for the same two conditions. These findings demonstrate the imbalance of load sharing properties between the lumbar intervertebral disc and facet joints, and suggest that musculoskeletal conditions influencing frontal plane spino-pelvic alignment may increase loading to spinal tissues, especially the facet joints.; The results from this dissertation demonstrated that women with diminished hip muscle performance use a kinematic and muscle activation profile that may increase loading on the lumbar spine. Further, direct measurements of spinal loading showed that altered spino-pelvic frontal plane alignment increased facet joint loading. These combined results support the potential for diminished hip muscle performance affecting spinal loading and suggest potential mechanisms for the development of low back problems.

40|$|The {{abstract}} can {{be viewed}} at [URL] theme: The Intervertebral Disc - from Degeneration to Therapeutic Motion PreservationShort Talk SessionIntroduction Degenerative spondylolisthesis (dSpl) is translation of the vertebral body in relation to adjacent levels, mainly attributed to degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc and facet joint complexes, and primarily occurs at L 4 -L 5. Studies have suggested that more sagittal oriented <b>facet</b> joints at <b>L</b> 4 -L 5 are associated with dSpl. However, the role of facet joint tropism (i. e., asymmetry between facet joint orientations) in L 4 -L 5 dSpl remains inconclusive, in particular, in an Asian population and possibly attributed to nonstandardized definitions of tropism. As such, the following study addressed the role of facet joint tropism in relation to L 4 -L 5 dSpl in the Asia Pacific region. Materials and Methods A multinational, multiethnic cross-sectional image-based study was performed in 34 institutions in the Asia Pacific region. Lateral standing radiographs and axial MRIs and/or CT scans were obtained for patients diagnosed with lumbar dSpl. Imaging assessment consisted of the following: magnitude of slip displacement, level of spondylolisthesis, and left/right L 4 - <b>L</b> 5 <b>facet</b> joint angulations were noted on image assessment. Patients with single level dSpl were included. Patients were further stratified into those presenting with (Group A) or without (Group B) L 4 -L 5 dSpl. Facet joint tropismwas defined as 7 degrees difference (Grogan et al 1997) between left and right facet joints and also assessed on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to identify critical values for multivariate analysis. Gender, age, weight/height (body mass index [BMI]), and ethnicity were also noted. Results The study included 351 patients (36. 9 % males and 63. 1 % females) {{with a mean age}} of 61. 8 years (range: 24 - 90 years). The mean BMIwas 25. 6 kg/m 2 (range: 15. 4 - 43. 9 kg/m 2). There were 267 patients (76. 1 %) in Group A and 84 individuals (23. 9 %) in Group B (control). Sex type (p ¼ 0. 295) and BMI (p ¼ 0. 227) did not significantly differ between groups, but elevated age was more pronounced with L 4 -L 5 dSpl (p ¼ 0. 001). There was a statistically significant difference between right and left L 4 -L 5 facet joint angulations between Group A (right mean: 57. 5 degrees; left mean: 55. 4 degrees) and Group B (right mean: 48. 4 degrees; left mean: 46. 5 degrees) (p < 0. 001). Based on facet joint tropism of 7 degrees difference between facet angulations, there was no statistically significant difference between groups. ROC analysis identified high sensitivity and specificity of facet joint angulation difference of 15 degrees or greater associated with dSpl. Based on ageadjusted multivariate analysis, facet joint tropism with a critical value of 15 degrees or greater angulation difference noted an odds ratio of 2. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 17 - 4. 67; p ¼ 0. 016) associated with dSpl. Slippage was noted with increased facet joint tropism, but the effects could not be discerned. Conclusion Greater sagittal FJ orientationwas associated with dSpl, aswas joint tropism. A critical value of 15 degrees FJ angle difference produced a twofold increased likelihood of dSpl. Our study broadens the understanding of FJ morphology and its role in degenerative sagittal plane instability. Acknowledgments This study was funded by AOSpine Asia Pacific.
