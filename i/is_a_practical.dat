5|$|Hemlock Hoax, the Detective is an American short comedy film {{produced}} and distributed in 1910 by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The silent film features a detective named Hemlock Hoax {{who tries to}} solve a murder, which unbeknownst to him <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> joke being played on him by two young boys. It {{was one of many}} shorts designed to derive its humor from a sleuth whose name was similar to Sherlock Holmes.|$|E
5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

5|$|With {{the opening}} of its Whopper Bar {{locations}} in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported {{that it would be}} the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase. Although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout Europe, including Burger King, this is the first time a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the United States. The company will be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E

25|$|The sum {{of proper}} divisors gives various {{other kinds of}} numbers. Numbers where the sum {{is less than the}} number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant. These terms, {{together}} with perfect itself, come from Greek numerology. A pair of numbers which are the sum of each other's proper divisors are called amicable, and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable. A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> number.|$|E
25|$|Freeze {{distillation}} is {{an analogous}} method of purification using freezing instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a recrystallization where {{the product is}} the mother liquor, and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process {{is used in the}} production of ice beer and ice wine to increase ethanol and sugar content, respectively. It is also used to produce applejack. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A molecular sieve <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> method for production. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.|$|E

25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260°F (−162°C).|$|E
25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap is {{the premier}} autologous skin graft for {{the reconstruction of}} a nose, by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery (an ophthalmic artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an ophthalmic artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus {{in order to enhance}} the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the skin flap is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.|$|E
500|$|A {{mechanical}} resonator {{consists of}} both a mass element and a compliance element. [...] Mechanical resonators are analogous to electrical LC circuits consisting of inductance and capacitance. [...] Real mechanical components unavoidably have both mass and compliance so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> proposition to make resonators as a single component. [...] In fact, {{it is more difficult}} to make a pure mass or pure compliance as a single component. [...] A spring can be made with a certain compliance and mass minimised, or a mass can be made with compliance minimised, but neither can be eliminated altogether. [...] Mechanical resonators are a key component of mechanical filters.|$|E

500|$|... "Nana's Party" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the second series of the British dark comedy {{anthology}} television programme Inside No. 9. It was first broadcast on 23 April 2015 on BBC Two. Written and directed by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the episode starred Claire Skinner as the obsessive-compulsive and aspirational Angela, who is hosting a party for the 79th birthday of her mother Maggie, played by Elsie Kelly. Angela's husband Jim, played by Pemberton, is keen to play a prank on Pat, Angela's brother-in-law, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> joker. Pat is played by Shearsmith, while Carol, a recovering alcoholic who is Pat's wife and Angela's sister, is played by Lorraine Ashbourne. The episode also features Eve Gordon as Katie, Angela and Jim's teenage daughter, and Christopher Whitlow as a paramedic seen {{at the beginning and}} end of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The Evil Dead and its sequels {{have become}} one of the largest cult film trilogies in history. David Lavery, in his book The Essential Cult TV Reader, surmised that Campbell's [...] "career <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> guide to {{becoming}} a cult idol". The film launched the careers of Raimi and Campbell, who have since collaborated frequently. Raimi has worked with Campbell in virtually all of his films since, and Campbell has appeared in cameo roles in all three of Raimi's Spider-Man films, (as well as a very brief appearance at the end of Darkman), which have become some of the highest-grossing films in history. Though it has often been considered an odd choice for Raimi—a director known for his violent horror films—to direct a family-friendly franchise, the hiring was mostly inspired by Raimi's passion for comic books as a kid. Raimi returned to the horror-comedy genre in 2009 with Drag Me to Hell.|$|E
