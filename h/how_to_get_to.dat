Treant tells them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Moon People, and {{they make their way}} to Brownboo, a village unaffected by the Genie's attack, and home of the Moon People. Toan asks them if they can seal the Genie again, but they explain they have forgotten how to use magic. However, the Moon People who live on the moon can still use magic, and so they decide to head there, using the Moon Ship, which can be activated by the Moon Orb. However, they discover the Orb is missing, having been accidentally traded with a batch of Moon Fruits.|$|E
25|$|Tramlink route 5 is {{the only}} {{extension}} being formally developed, linking Harrington Road with Crystal Palace, and Crystal Palace with Beckenham Junction, both terminating at Crystal Palace Parade. There were three options on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two. Following recent consultation the off-street option is favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as Crystal Palace Station, and then round {{the western edge of}} Crystal Palace Park (within the park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade. TfL has stated that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward, but also says that it is committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to Government.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves {{different parts of the}} brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E

500|$|The {{completely}} revised {{second edition}} of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed {{in detail in}} the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. [...] Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted {{as one of the}} more [...] "fascinating" [...] parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations. [...] Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation Foundation and St. Catherines Island. [...] A subject index was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. [...] Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. [...] Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in [...] "on-the-fly species identification." [...] Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. [...] Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers. [...] It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the films}} are presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of Gone to Coney Island survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9, 1910. It states: [...] "Kate has been employed {{for a number}} of years as a maid in the home of Mrs. Greene. Her 'young man,' Henry, works down at Coney [...] He induces Kate to leave her place and take a situation as a ticket seller at Luna Park. Kate tries to tell her mistress of her intended departure, but Mrs. Greene is busy and refuses to listen. Mrs. Greene goes out, during her absence, Kate takes French leave, leaving a note saying she is going to Coney Island. Never having visited the Island, Mrs. Greene considers it a jungle place. When she gets Kate's note, she thinks that her duty to immediately start in pursuit of the misguided girl. Not knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the island, she appeals to her old friend, Professor Griggs. He also is ignorant of the ways of Coney, but in turn appeals to his friend Casey, a ward politician, who of course knows the Island, and consents to act as their escort. The three set out for Coney and start on their search for Kate. The hunt is almost forgotten in the joys of looping the loop, shooting the chutes and various other diversions of the Island. When they finally find Kate, she is at her post, selling tickets at Luna. She laughs at Mrs. Greene's fears for her safety and announces the fact that she is happily married, and presents the lucky man. In a cool Coney corner, Mrs. Greene confesses that she found Coney wasn't as bad as it was painted, and she is going to revisit it often." ...|$|E
