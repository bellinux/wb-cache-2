25|$|In {{some cases}} {{hydrocarbon}} lubricating oil may {{be drawn into}} the compressor's cylinder directly through damaged or worn seals, and the oil may (and usually will) then undergo combustion, being ignited by the immense compression ratio and subsequent temperature rise. Since <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> don't burn well - especially when not atomized properly - incomplete combustion will result in carbon monoxide production.|$|E

They also warn that higher oil prices might lead to the exploitation of high-carbon alternatives such as oil sands, oil shales, <b>heavy</b> <b>oils,</b> and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing emissions, unless {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies are employed.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the primary}} methods used to extract <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> in the Peace River area is cold <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> {{production}} with sand(CHOPS). The process depends on <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> that is viscous enough to flow under normal operating conditions such that the application of heat through steam injection is not required.

25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil, called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> {{are similar to}} those with lighter oils. However, they provide additional concerns, such as the need to heat <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> to pump them out of the ground. Extraction also requires large volumes of water.|$|E

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>oil</b> is {{a common}} fuel for {{industrial}} furnaces, boilers, marines and diesel engines. Previous studies showed that the combustion of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> involves not only the complete burning of volatile matters but also the burn-out of coke residues. Detailed knowledge about <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> combustion therefore requires {{an understanding of the}} different burning stages of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> droplets in the burner. This in turn, demands knowledge about the single droplet evaporation and combustion characteristics. This study measured the temperature and size histories of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> (C glass) droplets burning in microgravity to elucidate the various stages that occur during combustion. The elimination of the gravity-induced gas convection in microgravity allows the droplet combustion to be studied in greater detail. Noting that the compositions of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> are various, we also tested the fuel blends of a diesel light oil (LO) and a <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> residue (HOR) ...|$|R
25|$|Often called {{conventional}} <b>heavy</b> <b>oil,</b> this low-density oil can {{be recovered}} by conventional drilling techniques or by waterflood, a technique of injecting {{water into the}} reservoir to increase pressure, thus forcing the oil toward the well bore. When these techniques work, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> is like the more commercially attractive lighter grades of <b>oil.</b> But <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> can also be quite viscous. It can need some form of heat or solvent and pressure before it can flow into a well bore to be produced. When <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> requires these techniques to go into production, it is known as non-conventional <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that polymer flood is a promising technology for recovering <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> However, higher polymer concentration {{will be required to}} mobilize <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> As a result, the cost of polymer will be significantly higher when polymer flood is applied in <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> fields.|$|R

30|$|A study (Lapham 2012) {{reported}} that the global oil reserves are estimated to contain 35 % light oil, 29 % medium <b>oil,</b> 26 % <b>heavy</b> <b>oil,</b> and 10 % extra <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> Though the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reserve is potentially huge in the world, especially South America, the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> recovery factor still remains low (Meyer et al. 2003). In addition, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> in fractured carbonate reservoirs represents 25 %– 30 % of the total oil {{in place in the}} Middle East (Saidi 1988). The thermal EOR has a potential to enhance the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. The Wafra oil field in Oman already shows the huge potential for thermal EOR in at least a portion of the field. Lapham evaluated the extensive EOR projects and concluded that hybrid thermal EOR combining with other EOR is efficient to recover the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, thermal EOR with LSWI can be a promising hybrid EOR for <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs. When this hybrid EOR technology is developed and secures practical feasibility, it will expand the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> market. One of the great candidate thermal EORs for the hybrid EOR is hot water injection. It is a waterflood-based EOR similar to LSWI. The field tests and experiments already have confirmed that hot water injection reduces <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity and improves <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> production (Kovscek et al. 2000; Alajmi et al. 2009; Duval et al. 2015). Additionally, it potentially influences pore connectivity because of temperature-dependent mineral reactions (Kovscek et al. 2000). The geochemical reactions are known to be sensitive to both temperature and pressure (Appelo and Postma 2005), so hot water injection significantly affects geochemical reactions.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{high demand}} for energy and {{depletion}} of light oil, {{we have to}} investigate technically and economically feasible methods to produce <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>Heavy</b> <b>oil</b> presents great challenges to oil producers. The drastic viscosity difference between <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> and water causes injected water to finger through the reservoir, leaving large quantities of oil behind. As a result, recovery of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> was often less than 20 % or even less than 10 % (Meyer 2003).|$|R

With depletion of light oil, {{we have to}} face the technical and economical challenges of developing <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> fields. Due to severe viscous fingering, the recoveries of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs are often below 20 % or even 10 %. Thermal methods have been successfully applied in many <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> fields. However, reservoirs at great depth or thin pay zones are not good candidates for thermal methods.|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} ultrasonic velocity as {{a function}} of temperature for several <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> sand samples from shallow depth. Initial measured results suggest that both P-and S-wave velocities of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> sands decrease significantly with increasing temperature. The main contributors to the decrease of velocity are: 1. Transition of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> properties from quasi-solid phase to the liquid phase with decrease modulus. 2. Change in the role of oil in the interaction between <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> and sand grains: from as part of the matrix transiting to as a pore fluid. 3. Frequency dependence of these properties. We have examined the applicability of the Gassmann’s equation for the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> saturated samples...|$|R
40|$|The oil {{industry}} is turning {{its attention to}} the more complex development of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> fields {{in order to meet}} the ever increasing demands of the manufacturing sector. The current thermal recovery techniques of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> developments provide an opportunity to benefit from the geothermal energy created during the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> production process. There is scope to improve the current recovery factors of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, and there is a need to investigate the associated geothermal energy potential that has been historically neglected. This paper presents a new concept of harnessing the geothermal energy potential of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs with the co-production of incremental reserves...|$|R
50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>oils,</b> oil sands, bitumen and biodegraded oils (as {{bacteria}} cannot assimilate asphaltenes, but readily consume {{saturated hydrocarbons}} and certain aromatic hydrocarbon isomers - enzymatically controlled) contain much higher proportions of asphaltenes than do medium-API oils or light oils.

50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>oils</b> can {{be found}} in shallow, young {{reservoirs}}, with rocks from the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene (younger than 25 million years).

40|$|With {{the growing}} demand for energy and the {{depletion}} of conventional crude <b>oil,</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> in huge reserve has attracted extensive attention. However, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> cannot be directly refined by existing processes unless they are upgraded due to its complex composition and high concentration of heteroatoms (N, S, Ni, V, etc.). Of the variety of techniques for <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> upgrading, supercritical water (SCW) is gaining popularity because of its excellent ability to convert <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> into valued, clean light oil by the suppression of coke formation {{and the removal of}} heteroatoms. Based on the current status of this research around the world, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> upgrading in SCW is summarized from three aspects: Transformation of hydrocarbons, suppression of coke, and removal of heteroatoms. In this work, the challenge and future development of the orientation of upgrading <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> in SCW are pointed out...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, an {{amphiphilic}} cobalt complex catalyst was synthesized {{and applied}} to reduce the viscosity of Shengli <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> The ligand is dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), which provides interfacial activity to the compound, and the active metal Co 2 +. The catalyst was cobalt dodecylbenzenesulfonate, CoDBS. The catalytic aquathermolysis of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> {{was carried out in}} a high pressure autoclave at 250  °C. The viscosities of the <b>heavy</b> crude <b>oil</b> and the cracked <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> samples were determined at both 80 and 50  °C after dehydration strictly to avoid the influence of wax, and/or the effect of dilution and emulsification of water. The changes of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> compositions, SARA (saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene) compositions, and average molecular structures were studied to investigate the mechanism of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity reduction during catalytic aquathermolysis.|$|R
50|$|Shale oil {{produced}} by some technologies, {{such as the}} Kiviter process, can be used without further upgrading as an oil constituent and {{as a source of}} phenolic compounds.

50|$|Larger engines (from about 3 MWe to 30 MWe) {{sometimes}} use <b>heavy</b> <b>oils,</b> essentially tars, {{derived from}} the end of the refining process. The slight added complexity of keeping the fuel oil heated to enable it to flow, whilst mitigating the fire risks that come from over-heating fuel, make these fuels unpopular for smaller, often unmanned, generating stations.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} steam locomotives, coal fired tugboats {{fell out of}} favor when <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> became {{dominant}} as an industrial fuel. The reason BEDT operated their steam locomotives later than any other railroads, is that their tugs were fired by Bunker C fuel as well.

30|$|As Fig.  10 shows, {{there is}} an obvious {{discrepancy}} between the temperature of water and <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> saturated samples compared to the dry ones. The temperature for the water saturated samples {{is less than the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> saturated ones because the vaporisation point of water is higher than the oil. Moreover, the thermal capacity of water is more than the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> and so vaporisation of water needs less temperature. Another reason for this difference is the higher absorption of the laser energy of <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> compared to that of water.|$|R
