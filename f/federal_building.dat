The <b>Federal</b> <b>Buildings</b> Supplemental Survey (FBSS) was conducted by EIA in conjunction with DOE`s Office of Federal Energy Management Programs (OFEMP) {{to gain a better understanding}} of how <b>Federal</b> <b>buildings</b> use energy. This report presents the data from 881 completed telephone interviews with <b>Federal</b> <b>buildings</b> in three <b>Federal</b> regions. These <b>buildings</b> were systematically selected using OFEMP`s specifications; therefore, these data do not statistically represent all <b>Federal</b> <b>buildings</b> in the country. The purpose of the FBSS was threefold: (1) to understand the characteristics of <b>Federal</b> <b>buildings</b> and their energy use; (2) to provide a baseline in these three Federal regions to measure future energy use in <b>Federal</b> <b>buildings</b> as required in EPACT; and (3) to compare building characteristics and energy use with the data collected in the CBECS...|$|R

On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated {{on the site of the}} Murrah <b>Federal</b> <b>Building,</b> commemorating the victims of the bombing.

The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant Rocky Flats, the Denver Federal Center, Byron G. Rogers <b>Federal</b> <b>Building</b> and United States Courthouse, the Denver Mint, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah <b>Federal</b> <b>Building,</b> killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E

Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited {{and locked the}} truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped {{the keys to the}} truck a few blocks away.|$|E
