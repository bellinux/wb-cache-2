5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became an absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially <b>for</b> <b>older</b> aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|This study takes {{a unified}} {{approach}} {{to assess the}} roles of preferences and expectations on preparation <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age in France. Our sample {{is representative of the}} customers of a large notfor-profit insurance company (“mutuelle”) and contains 1231 individuals aged 50 year and above. We use information on the general feeling to prepare <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age, specific preparation activities in various domains (e. g. the purchase of long-term care insurance or home adaptation), risk and time attitudes, family and social altruism, and expected disability and longevity. Half of the sample reports preparing <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age. Time preference emerges as an important predictor of preparation: indeed, making plans in general increases preparation <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age by 8. 5 percentage points. Family altruism is positively associated with preparation in the finances and housing domains, whereas social altruism is not. While risk attitudes and altruism matter <b>for</b> preparation <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age, their effect may be less systematic across outcomes than that of time preference. Individuals who expect to become disabled or to live longer are more likely to prepare <b>for</b> <b>old</b> age. Policies promoting healthy aging should include messages targeting present-oriented individuals and try to make people more future-oriented...|$|R

5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly <b>for</b> <b>older</b> sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued <b>for</b> <b>older</b> versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications <b>for</b> <b>older</b> adults.|$|E

In 1952 the boys moved to the newly opened Abbotsfield School and Swakeleys became a girls' secondary modern school. The girls' school moved from Ickenham to share the site of Abbotsfield School for Boys in Hillingdon in 1973. Vyners School opened as a grammar school on 12 January 1960 and later became a comprehensive. Delays in building work meant the first intake of pupils were taught at St Mary's Grammar School in Northwood Hills from 9 September 1959.|$|E
