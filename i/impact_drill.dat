30|$|One of {{the current}} goals of {{the oil and gas}} {{industry}} is to minimize the environmental <b>impact</b> during <b>drilling</b> operations. This is because an effective management of the environmental <b>impacts</b> during <b>drilling</b> operation has proven to lead to a greater access of reserves in environmentally sensitive areas, particularly those classified as ‘off-limits’ [1, 2, 3]. As a consequence, a significant number of Environmentally Friendly Drilling (EFD) technologies continue to emerge, but these have not been integrated into a decision-making method capable of combining them to define an optimal drilling system for specific conditions on a given site. In practice, the major challenge is to select the best combination of EFD technologies based on a set of competing evaluation criteria. In this paper, a ‘system’ will be defined as a set of EFD technologies.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Particle <b>Impact</b> <b>Drilling</b> {{technology}} (PID) {{is a new}} drilling technology, {{which is}} designed especially to solve {{the oil and gas}} exploration under hard terrane. In PID system, the steel particles were added in the <b>drilling</b> fluid to <b>impact</b> rock. The particles would be recycled and put to use again, thus it is of great significance to adjust proper drilling fluid flow rate for steel particle’s reflux. The flow rate of drilling fluids carrying particles is influenced by the fluid viscosity, the annular gap between drill pipe and wellbore, the particle volume fraction and particle size, etc. This paper mainly studied the influence of the annular gap and the flow rate, while the other factors keep constant. Both experimental method and dimension theory were employed in the research. Furthermore, empirical formula was proposed to describe the mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Particle <b>Impact</b> <b>Drilling</b> is an {{efficient}} drilling technology for deep-well hard formation which cuts rock mainly by high-speed spherical particle impacting rock {{with the help}} of hydraulic action and mechanical action. In order to determine main influence factors and their order of priority, the orthogonal experiment was designed and the experimental data was analyzed with both the general method and the variance method. The analysis indicates that the order of priority of the main influence factors of particle water jet rock-cutting performance is pump pressure ps, impacting range S, particle mass concentration ω, confining pressure P and particle diameter dp. Moreover, ps is highly important and S and ω are important. In addition, high ps, moderate S, moderate ω, moderate dp and low P could effectively promote particle water jet to impact and cut rocks.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, various methods have been {{proposed}} to evaluate drilling cost and complexity, {{but because of the}} large number of factors and events that <b>impact</b> <b>drilling</b> performance, predictive models are difficult to construct.

Drill rates are often constrained by factors that the driller does not control and in ways that cannot be documented. The Joint Association Survey and Mechanical Risk Index the most popular methods used to evaluate drilling cost and complexity in the Gulf of Mexico, and specialized indices have been introduced to characterize are the complexity of drilling directional and extended reach wells.

40|$|Particle <b>Impact</b> <b>Drilling</b> (PID) {{is a novel}} {{method to}} improve the rate of {{penetration}} (ROP). In order to further improve the performance of PID, {{an investigation into the}} effect of single and double particles: (1) diameter; (2) initial velocity; (3) distance; and (4) angle of incidence was undertaken to investigate their effects on broken volume and penetration depth into hard brittle rock. For this purpose, the laboratory experiment of single particle impact rock was employed. Meanwhile, based on the LS-DYNA, a new finite element (FE) simulation of the PID, including single and double particles impact rock, has been presented. The 3 -dimensional (3 D), aix-symmetric, dynamic-explicit, Lagrangian model has been considered in this simulation. And the Elastic and Holmquist Johnson Cook (HJC) material behaviors have been used for particles and rocks, respectively. The FE simulation results of single particle impacting rock are good agreement with experimental data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project thesis is to {{investigate}} shallow hazards that pose drilling and rig placement risks in Kwanza Basin (offshore Angola). These risks are naturally occurring and are widespread in offshore Angola. The project work of shallow hazard permits us to identify near geology features that may <b>impact</b> <b>drilling</b> operations and improve future well planning, also can serve as an analogue for understanding the geology of the study area. By using the 3 D seismic data and seismic attribute allows us to analyze the features to be recognized and mapped. To interpret geological feature through the 3 D cube, {{it was necessary to}} do a combination of surface horizons maps, seismic attributes such as RMS amplitudes, variance map and geobodies extraction for better understanding subsurface geological features. As result of the interpretation, an analysis of isolated and strong reflector was made on the seismic data by using different attributes along of the subsurface; hence, this strong reflector might be gas accumulation due to reverse polarity relative to the seabed. In addition, some depression zones called pockmarks were identified throughout are associated to the fault of upward fluids migration. This event shows the overpressure zones. Therefore, these can pose stability concerns and implications to drilling operations for offshore installations and field development. </p...|$|R
