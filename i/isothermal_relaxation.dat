40|$|Abstract. Recent {{studies have}} shown that the Cu/cap layer {{interface}} is the dominant diffusion path for electromigration (EM) in Cu interconnects, making it important to develop effective methods to evaluate the effect of passivation layer on interfacial mass transport and EM lifetime for Cu interconnects. This work shows that a set of <b>isothermal</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> tests together with appropriate modeling analysis can be used to evaluate the kinetics of interface and grain boundary diffusion and the effects of passivation layer. Thermal stresses in electroplated Cu films with and without passivation were measured using a bending beam technique, subjected to thermal cycling and isothermal annealing at selected conditions. Thermal cycling experiments provide information to select the initial stresses and temperatures for isothermal stress measurements. A kinetic model coupling grain boundary diffusion with surface and interface diffusion was developed and found to account well for the <b>isothermal</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> experiments within a certain range of temperatures and stresses. Based on the kinetic model, both the grain boundary diffusivity and the Cu/SiN interface diffusivity were deduced from <b>isothermal</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> measurements.

The cooling scan allows and measures the material as the molecules lose mobility, so it is going from an equilibrium state and gradually moving away from equilibrium as the cooling rate exceeds the relaxation rate.

40|$|Volume {{relaxation}} and related phenomena {{in the glass}} transition of polymers are discussed. During volume relaxation, the molecular transport mobility changes. First, this in principle implies non-linearity of the volume relaxation process itself. The apparent contradiction of this fact with the linearity domain found experimentally by Goldbach (1) could be explained. Secondly, during volume relaxation the viscoelastic processes change their location in time scale, due to the change in molecular transport mobility. This is demonstrated by experimental results for poly(styrene). The change of mechanical properties during volume relaxation strongly increased with a decrease in frequency of the mechanical deformation. Consequently one should also be careful with mechanical measurements in the glass transition range, especially when performed at lower frequencies.

The evaluation procedure of the curvature data is explained in detail and has been tested {{with the help of}} passivated SiO_ 2 -lines in which the stresses can be calculated elastically. The comparison to elastic Finite-Element-Method results show excellent agreement. The used capacitive determination of the wafer curvature is especially suitable for stress relaxation measurements at constant temperature with high resolution in time (15 s) and stress change (< 1 MPa). The main results are: Blanket films of Au, Al and Al(1 %) Si(0. 5 %) Cu show very similar behaviour: The flow stress in tension and compression vary linearly with temperature and about inversely with film thickness. The logarithmic stress relaxation rate - i. e. the logarithmic derivation of the stress relaxation curve - shows the same dependence on temperature and film thickness. This behaviour can be described by a dislocation glide model including thermally activated overcome of obstacles at the film surface and at the interface. In AlSiCu-films hardening is observed by #THETA#-Al_ 2 Cu-precipitates below 200 C. In unpassivated AlSiCu-lines with aspect ratio near a= 1 (a=thickness/width) a nearly uniaxial stress distribution in the direction parallel to the lines has been observed, because the stresses perpendicular to the lines are nearly zero. This is attributed to elastic stress relaxation due to the nearly free side surfaces and the free top surface. Passivated AlSiCu-lines (a#approx# 1) behave nearly completely elastically during thermal cycling, i. e. within the experimental errors neither relief of hydrostatic stress due to voiding nor of the shear stress has been observed. In agreement with the Eshelby theory the stress component parallel to the lines is larger than those perpendicular to the lines which should be equal. This indeed was shown by independent stress determination with X-ray diffractometry. The <b>isothermal</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> depends strongly on the temperature with a maximum relaxation at 250 C. The time and temperature dependence could be explained by stress induced void growth controlled by grain boundary diffusion.
