In particular, the low-field free-flux-flow resistivity turns out to obey the law of corresponding states discovered in conventional superconductors, while the high-field resistivity reveals a noticeable effect of the s-wave coupling on lifting the effective upper critical field. The flux flow near and above the depinning current in the presence of a twin boundary or random impurities also assumes a conventional behavior: The current dependence of the flux-flow resistivity can be well described by an overdamped model for a particle subject to <b>driving</b> and <b>pinning</b> forces.

40|$|International audienceTransport in {{unsaturated}} macropores or fractured porous media displays intermittent water fluxes and preferential flow pathways [1]. Front instabilities play {{an important}} role in these dynamics. However, in porous media the modeling of the surface has to take into account chemical heterogeneities and/or topographic roughness. In fact, micro-or mesoscale heterogeneities are expected to affect the macroscopic movement of drops. For instance, they are responsible for contact angle hysteresis, the roughening of contact lines and the stick-slip motion of weakly driven contact lines [2]. The present contribution focusses on the spatio-temporal patterns of capillary-and wettability-dominated flow resulting from the interplay between <b>driving</b> and <b>pinning</b> forces. In particular, we consider a thin free-surface liquid film/drop on a substrate striped by defects driven by gravity. The defects are modeled using a spatially variable wettability leading to an evolution equation for the film height [3]. This approach enables one to (i) study the depinning transition employing tools from dynamical systems theory and bifurcation theory, and (ii) investigate the dynamics of the stick-slip motion that occurs after depinning on substrates with many defects. Recently, a specific numerical code has been developed to perform these tasks for a 3 D system [4]...|$|R

40|$|In {{the mixed}} state of type II superconductors, {{vortices}} penetrate the sample {{and form a}} correlated system due to the screening of supercurrents around them. Interestingly, we can study this correlated system {{as a function of}} density and driving force. The density, for instance, is controlled by the magnetic field, B, whereas a current density j acts as a driving force F=jxB on all vortices. The free motion of vortices is inhibited by the presence of an underlying potential, which tends to pin the vortices. Hence, to minimize the pinning strength we studied a superconducting glass in which the depinning current is 10 to 1000 times smaller than in previous studies, which enables us to map out the complete phase diagram in this new regime.
