5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa {{as well as most}} other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed {{standard}} for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, {{and was later}} {{employed}} for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E

5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define {{how much of the}} household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E

5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
