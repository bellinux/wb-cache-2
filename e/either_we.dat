5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. <b>Either</b> <b>we</b> {{are at the}} center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
5|$|The pilots' smaller stories {{actually}} make a bigger point, {{which is that}} we're all {{together in the same}} robot … <b>Either</b> <b>we</b> get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E

25|$|On two occasions, {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} cosmologist Stephen Hawking has argued for space colonization {{as a means}} of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space. In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: <b>either</b> <b>we</b> colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, or we will face the prospect of long-term extinction.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation {{by other}} teams through {{additional}} high-precision RVs {{would be most}} welcome. But if GJ 581g is confirmed by further RV scrutiny, {{the mere fact that}} a habitable planet has been detected this soon, around such a nearby star, suggests that η could well be on the order of a few tens of percent, and thus that <b>either</b> <b>we</b> have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery.|$|E

25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on <b>either.</b> <b>We</b> cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007). Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, {{we need to do}} it for a new set of reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And we wanted to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} <b>either.</b> <b>We</b> wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Junqueira felt {{he could}} have won the race had a caution flag not been displayed. Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because I really think we had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, <b>either.</b> <b>We</b> were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E

2500|$|Clearly, this is {{a matter}} of walking the {{reachability}} graph defined above, until <b>either</b> <b>we</b> reach the requested marking or we know it can no longer be found.

2500|$|The New York Times {{was even}} less kind. [...] Although {{reviewer}} Mark Kamine noted that [...] "Keenan gets off some decent one-liners" [...] and that references to Los Angeles landmarks were [...] "made sparingly {{and used to}} good effect", he felt the book engaged in [...] "incessant name-dropping," [...] {{that many of the}} jokes were too topical, and that Keenan's humor was too blunt.

2500|$|Palin opposes New START, a {{bilateral}} nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. She {{argued that the}} treaty is [...] "one-sided" [...] because it [...] "actually requires the U.S. to reduce our nuclear weapons and allows the Russians to increase theirs." [...] Palin further stated that the treaty's link between offensive and defensive weapons [...] "virtually guarantees that <b>either</b> <b>we</b> limit our missile defenses or the Russians will withdraw from the treaty." ...|$|E
2500|$|In education, the {{ethic of}} care speaks of {{obligation}} to do something right and {{a sense that we}} must do something right when others address us. The [...] "I must" [...] response is induced in direct encounter in preparation for response. [...] We respond because we want to; <b>either</b> <b>we</b> love and respect those that address us or we have significant regard for them. As a result, the recipients of care must respond in a way that demonstrates their caring has been received.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Weatherspoon, {{one of the}} Tomcat {{fighter pilots}} later {{recalled}} that the nighttime intercepts were not overly difficult [...] "It wasn't a big deal.
