5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E
5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between {{the owners of the}} Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E

5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> plate girder bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge {{were said to have}} been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E
