They considered implementing a system similar to DayZ in which players who kill other players get unique outfits that identify them as 'bandits', or possibly a rating or color-coded system. However, the developers ultimately rejected all of these, as they felt it would detract from player freedom. Instead, they found to their surprise that the implementation of voice chat had a noticeable effect on player behavior. With the ability to communicate, many players would no longer kill each other on sight out of fear.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{methods that}} {{directly}} observe behaviors avoid the attitudinal fallacy {{as a matter}} of course. However many <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> are not easily observed. Ethnography can make rich observations and descriptions <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> and allow for comparison between behavior and attitude. Unfortunately, in general ethnographic data cannot be used to draw statistically generalizable conclusions about behavior in a population.Ethnographers can still commit the attitudinal fallacy if they rely on quotations as evidence for behaviors. Experiments in laboratories make it possible to observe behavior, with the limitations that come from the laboratory situation. Internet research makes it possible to study a wide array <b>of</b> <b>behaviors</b> that leave traces online. Data from the Internet of things and sensors that record behavior like from location tracking may make it possible to measure more <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> that avoids the attitudinal fallacy.

2500|$|The {{terminology}} of the MBTI {{has been}} criticized as being very [...] "vague and general", so as to allow any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> to fit any personality type, which may result in the Forer effect, where people give a high rating to a positive description that supposedly applies specifically to them. [...] Others argue that while the MBTI type descriptions are brief, they are also distinctive and precise. Some theorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions, providing even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey's descriptions of his four temperaments, which he correlated with the sixteen MBTI personality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use, intellectual orientation, educational and vocational interests, social orientation, self-image, personal values, social roles, and characteristic hand gestures.|$|E
