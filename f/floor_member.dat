40|$|Robust frames {{subjected}} to earthquakes and other hazards such as explosions require relatively weak beams, but strong connections and columns. The reason {{is to avoid}} collapse of the structure without producing significant energy absorption, which is demanded by exceptional events like those under consideration in current paper. In particular, for earthquake design, when moment resisting frames are of concern, {{it is necessary to}} apply design rules aimed at obtaining dissipative collapse mechanisms of the structure, which re-quire the formation of ductile plastic hinges at the beam ends rather than in the columns (to avoid partial sto-rey mechanisms) {{as well as in the}} beam-to column connections (to avoid brittle failures). On the other hand, robust design due to explosion hazards has to be related to the capability of the structure to avoid progressive collapse due to the loss of a column. In such a case alternative load paths must be present if disproportionate collapse is to be avoided. These can be in for form of bracing systems, or more commonly, alternative load paths can be found through catenary action of the <b>floor</b> <b>members.</b> In this case the connections to the <b>floor</b> <b>members</b> must be designed to accommodate the large sagging deformations that develop in the beams. This creates an exceptional situation whereby the remaining part of the structure should be able to support such an overloading. Also for steel constructions, a robust structural design cannot be easily achieved, since there are several factors - including strain hardening, the routine supply of over strength steel and high rates of strain - that can cause a brittle behavior of some components, e. g. the beam-to-column connections, which have to be intended as key elements for achieving a successful design. These factors are investigated in this paper, pro-viding useful issues that can guide to a correct design of robust steel frames to avoid premature collapse due to extreme loadin...|$|R
25|$|Galeus is a genus of catshark, {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae, commonly known as sawtail catsharks in reference to a distinctive saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles, found along the upper edges of their caudal fins. They {{are found in the}} Atlantic, the western and central Pacific, and the Gulf of California, inhabiting deep waters at or close to the sea <b>floor.</b> <b>Members</b> of this genus are rather small, slim sharks with firm bodies and thick, rough skin. Their heads are usually fairly long and pointed, and have large mouths with well-developed furrows at the corners. They have large pectoral and anal fins, and two similar dorsal fins placed well back. Many species are ornately patterned with dark saddles and/or blotches. Sawtail catsharks feed on various invertebrates and fishes, and may be either egg-laying or live-bearing. These harmless sharks are sometimes caught as bycatch but are of minimal commercial value.|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. This paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} contribution of floor brokers and local <b>floor</b> <b>members</b> (locals) towards the price discovery process. Using detailed Share Price Index (SPI) futures contract {{data from the}} Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE), we construct 1 - and 5 -min series of volume weighted average prices for both floor brokers and locals. Estimates of Gonzalo and Granger [J. Bus. Econ. Stat. 13 (1995) 27] plus Hasbrouck [J. Finance 50 (1995) 1175] information shares reveal that trades initiated by locals account for approximately one-third of all price discovery within the market. Also, {{it is found that}} the locals' share of price discovery is higher than their share of trading activity. However, when there is high volatility or when observation intervals are lengthened, locals' contribution to price discovery declines. We conclude that although floor brokers are the main contributors, locals do play a significant role within the price discovery process. Kingsley Fong and Ralf Zurbruegg[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Minimizing floor-to-floor {{heights in}} mid- to {{high-rise}} buildings {{is a concern}} held by both engineers and architects. Many {{attempts have been made}} in steel construction to adopt design philosophies that utilize structural <b>floor</b> <b>members</b> with high span/depth ratios. These designs, however, have been limited to floor systems that predominantly span in one direction. The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the structural feasibility of interlocking open-web steel joists to form a panelized two-way steel floor system. This thesis includes a detailed discussion of the fabrication of the proposed floor system. A complete description of a proposed construction sequence is also presented. Finally, the structural behavior of the floor system is demonstrated under static loading. Conclusions were made discussing the benefits of this new system as well as recommendations for the direction of further investigation. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Chris Foley, for his time, guidance, and willingness to listen as my proposed floor system design evolved.

40|$|For {{deformation}} {{analysis of}} partially cracked <b>floor</b> <b>members</b> of reinforced concrete, a procedure with some modifications to our earlier system is proposed. Instead of its having relied on that concept of {{average for the}} oft-cited effective member stiffness long used thus far at least in ancillary form by the ACI Code, the present system can afford {{to account for the}} detail of steel arrangement along a member by treating all its sections assumed attendant on finite difference subdivision for beam analysis. In a consistent attempt, the whole lengthwise sectional variation is considered as well in the long-time case of analysis. Then, a long standing notion of increased modular ratio is adopted, alternatively to the ACI 2 ̆ 7 s time-dependent multiplier which is given also in average form by way of direct inclusion of the effect of the creep resistant compression steel. Relative adequacy of the proposed procedure is discussed in comparison of many cases of earlier test results in the literature with deflection estimates by our method and commonly available code methods...|$|R
