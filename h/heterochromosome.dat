50|$|An {{allosome}} (also {{referred to}} as a sex chromosome, heterotypical chromosome, <b>heterochromosome,</b> or idiochromosome) is a chromosome that differs from an ordinary autosome in form, size, and behavior. The human sex chromosomes, a typical pair of mammal allosomes, determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction. Autosomes differ from allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex.|$|E
40|$|The {{karyotype}} of the isopod crustacean Asellus aquaticus {{does not}} normally display any heteromorphic sex chromosome pair. Some {{of the males}} in a wild population of A. aquaticus collected in the Sarno river near Naples do display a heteromorphic chromosome pair. The heteromorphism {{is due to the}} presence of two intercalary heterochromatic areas on one chromosome. This chromosome is inherited through the male line as a normal Y chromosome. The heteromorphic pair has retained the capacity to recombine during meiosis. In-situ hybridization of ribosomal probes, labelled with digoxigenin—dUTP, reveals that ribosomal sequences are associated with both intercalary heterochromatic areas of the <b>heterochromosome.</b> The ribosomal genes are normally telomeric and associated with heterochromatin. After digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI, EcoRl and HindIII restriction endonucleases and hybridization with ribosomal probes, the hybridization patterns of the males with the <b>heterochromosome</b> differ from those of the males without the <b>heterochromosome,</b> as well as from those of the females, which are identical. The possible origin of the morphological differentiation of the <b>heterochromosome,</b> and the causes of the differences in the ribosomal DNA restriction patterns linked to the presence of this chromosome, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Chromosome {{behaviour}} during male meioses {{has been}} studied in two bisexual amphimictic populations of two tardigrade species, namely Richtersius coronifer and Macrobiotus richtersi (Eutardigrada, Macrobiotidae). Both bisexual populations exhibit a diploid chromosome number 2 n = 12 and no sex chromosomes were identified. DAPI staining and C-banding data indicate that all chromosomes of the bisexual population of R. coronifer are acrocentric. In both species, at male meiotic prophase, all six bivalent homologous chromosomes are aligned side by side along their length and show no evidence of chiasmata. However, in the oocytes of both species a chiasma is generally present in each bivalent at diplotene stage. Lack of recombination is previously unknown in tardigrades, but is a well known phenomenon in many other metazoans where it is always restricted to the heterogametic sex. In tardigrades {{there is no evidence}} of <b>heterochromosomes,</b> but it does not mean that in tardigrades, the heterogametic sex does not exist.

Myoxus glis shows 2 n= 62; comparison of our specimens from different localities shows complete correspondence between karyotypes, both for the autosomes and the heterochromosomes. Diyomys nitedula shows 2 n= 48. All populations we studied, show the same karyotypic pattern, except for the NOR-bearing chromosomes. Myomimus roachi, here studied for the first time, shows 2 n= 44. All the autosomes are biarmed of decreasing size. The X-chromosome is a medium size metacentric, while the Y-chromosome is the smallest one. All the three species we studied, show one pair of NOR-bearing chromosomes, Ag-NORs always correspond to the secondary constriction.

40|$|Cellular {{autoradiography}} {{was used}} to measure relative rates of chromosomal RNA synthesis and to examine the regulatory phenomenon of X-linked dosage compensation in Drosophila miranda, a species containing two distinct, nonhomologous X chromosomes (X 1 and X 2). The X 1 chromosome was found to be dosage-compensated, since the rate of RNA synthesis along the single X 1 chromosome in males equaled that of both X 1 chromosomes in females. Unlike other sex chromosomes that have been studied, the more recently evolved X 2 <b>heterochromosome</b> exhibited regional differences in transcriptional activity when males and females were compared. The distal 10 % of the X 2 was not dosage-compensated, whereas the majority of an interior segment, representing 30 % of the X 2 chromosome's length, was found to be dosage-compensated. Our data are consistent with the idea that the evolution of X 2 dosage compensation has paralleled the differentiation of the X 2 sex chromosome. In addition, gene rearrangement seems to have accompanied the acquisition of a dosage-compensory mechanism in the X 2...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) mapping of reproductive isolation traits between Ostrinia nubilalis (the European corn borer) and its sibling species O. scapulalis (the Adzuki bean borer), focusing on two traits: mating isolation (mi) and pheromone production (Pher). Four genetic maps were generated from two backcross families, with two maps (one chromosomal map and one linkage map) per backcross. We located 165 - 323 AFLP markers on these four maps, {{resulting in the}} identification of 27 - 31 linkage groups, depending on the map considered. No-choice mating experiments with the offspring of each backcross led to the detection of at least two QTLs for mi in different linkage groups.

40|$|Triatoma klugi is a Chagas {{disease vector}} in the Rio Grande do Sul State. Triatominae {{chromosomes}} are holocentric and sex chromosomes segregation is post-reductional. In this paper {{we describe the}} karyotype of male T. klugi and a meiotic analysis including the nucleolar behavior during spermatogenesis. Testis cells were analyzed after lacto-acetic orcein and silver nitrate staining. Two autosomes and the <b>heterochromosomes</b> presented nucleolar activity (Ag-NORs) during diplotene-diakinesis. The analysis of metaphase I and II revealed a karyotype with 2 n = 20 +XY. In metaphase I a prominent nucleolar mass was observed in the cell periphery and small silver grains were detected in metaphase II. During anaphase, the chromosomes segregated in parallel and a typical holocentric late migration behavior was observed. The restoration of the nucleolus was an important feature in this phase.

40|$|Triatomines are {{of great}} concern in public health because they are vectors of Chagas' disease. This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of the}} species Triatoma melanosoma. The cytogenetic characteristics of triatomines include holocentric chromosomes, post-reductional meiosis in the sex chromosomes and nucleolar fragmentation in the meiotic cycle. The methodology utilized consisted of the techniques of lacto-acetic orcein staining and silver ion impregnation. The organs analyzed were adult testicles. The results enabled to classify the chromosomes by number and size, being three large, eight medium and one small <b>heterochromosome.</b> The three largest chromosomes and the heterochromosomes showed heteropyknotic chromatin in meiosis. The heterochromosomes in 8. 05 % of the cells in metaphase I behaved as pseudobivalents, contrasting with 91. 95 % of the cells with individualized sex chromosomes, confirming the achiasmatic nature of these chromosomes. However, the pseudobivalents occurred prominently in metaphase II (78. 38 %), this fact probably is related to the post-reductional nature of the sex chromosomes. The nucleolus in T. melanosoma persisted until the diplotene phase after which it began to fragment. Nucleolar corpuscles were observed in metaphases I and II and during anaphases I and II, these characteristics being related to the phenomenon of nucleolar persistence. In the initial spermatids, peripheral silver ion impregnation occurred, which could be analogous to the pre-nucleolar corpuscles observed after fragmentation. Thus, this study extends our knowledge of the characteristics of triatomines, in particular, heteropyknotic degree, kinetic activity, formation of sex chromosome achiasmatic pseudobivalency, confirmation of the fragmentation phenomenon, and post-meiotic nucleolar reactivation. ©FUNPEC-RP...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was a {{molecular}} and cytogenetic analysis of three cases of caprine freemartinism. The objects of the study were three White Improved goats culled due to infertility. The SRY gene was treated as a marker of presence (or absence) of the Y chromosome in the population of the blood nuclear cells carrying XY <b>heterochromosomes,</b> which occurs in a female organism originating from a heterosexual twin birth. In order to confirm cellular chimaerism that had been diagnosed basing on the presence of SRY gene, additional chromosomal analyses were carried out. Our studies have revealed that all three animals had the SRY gene linked with the Y chromosome. Bearing in mind that goats are genetically predestined to twin births, as well as due to a small incidence of clinically or molecularly diagnosed cases of freemartinism, it seems important to carry on studies in this scope, which can create a basis for wider characterisation of this syndrome in the domestic goat. Infertility, freemartinism, goats Freemartinism is a condition occurring in twins of different sexes, where an imperfect masculinised sterile female twin is born with a male.

40|$|Genetic {{differences}} both {{between individuals}} and populations are studied for their evolutionary relevance {{and for their}} potential medical applications. Most of the genetic differentiation among populations are caused by random drift that should affect all loci across the genome in a similar manner. When a locus shows extraordinary high or low levels of population differentiation, this may be interpreted as evidence for natural selection. The most used measure of population differentiation was devised by Wright and is known as fixation index, or F(ST). We performed a genome-wide estimation of F(ST) on about 4 millions of SNPs from HapMap project data. We demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of F(ST) values between autosomes and <b>heterochromosomes.</b> When we compared the F(ST) values obtained in this study with another evolutionary measure obtained by comparative interspecific approach, we found that genes under positive selection appeared to show low levels of population differentiation. We applied a gene set approach, widely used for microarray data analysis, to detect functional pathways under selection. We found that one pathway related to antigen processing and presentation showed low levels of F(ST), while several pathways related to cell signalling, growth and morphogenesis showed high F(ST) values. Finally, we detected a signature of selection within genes associated with human complex diseases. These results can help to identify which process occurred during human evolution and adaptation to different environments.

Inserts cloned in a plasmid vector were individually tested on Southern blots of DNA {{of males and females}} for sex specificity. No sex-specific insert was obtained from trout, but two out of ten inserts cloned from L. elongatus showed sex-specific patterns in this species: one corresponds to a sequence present on both Z and W chromosomes, while the other is W specific. Sequences of these two inserts show neither clear homology with other known sequences, nor an open reading frame. They cross-hybridize with the genomic DNA of Leporinusfriderici, but without sex-specific patterns. Twenty-four L. elongatus adults were sexed by gonadal observation, chromosomed examination and Southern hybridization with one or the other insert. Ten males and 11 females had chromosomes and hybridization patterns typical of their sex. One ZW female was recognized as a male with the W-specific probe. This was also the case for two unusual ZW males, one having a male hybridization pattern with the other probe. These three atypical individuals may result from single genetic exchanges between four regions of the Z and the W, giving rise to three atypical W chromosomes.

40|$|In {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the {{acknowledged}} sex-determining system is genetic sex determination (GSD) with female homogamety (_XX-_XY). Subsequently, mitotic gynogens are all {{expected to be}} females. Unexpected maleness was fortuitously observed in a mitotic gynogenetic family of rainbow trout (13 males out of 27). An equal ratio {{of males and females}} suggested the possible segregation of some Mendelian sex-influencing factor. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis of the inheritance and expression of the factor involved, the transmission of maleness was studied across the next three generations, using both conventional and/or meiotic and mitotic gynogenetic offspring. On the whole, males as well as intersexes were observed in crosses between two expected carrier parents, and in gynogenetic offspring of expected carrier females, but not in crosses between one expected carrier parent and one normal XX control. Sex ratios in the different crosses often fitted Mendelian proportions, but not always. Both excess and lack of maleness were observed. The simplest hypothesis consistent with most results is a one-locus model, assuming the existence of a mutation (termed mal) of a sex-determining gene, which is able to override the primary XX mechanism of sex determination and to induce the development of testicular tissue in the gonads of expected XX individuals. The one-locus model requires that the mal mutation usually, but not systematically, behave as a recessive mutation and have a limited penetrance, that is, heterozygous (mal/_) may be sex reversed, homozygous (mal/ mal) may remain female, and carrier individuals may undergo partial masculinization alone (many intersexes were recorded). Inconsistency in sex ratios among offspring of parents expected to respond the same way was recorded, indicating that other modifier loci may also be involved. Finally, the occurrence of both males and females in clonal progenies showed that epigenetic factors also likely influence the expression of maleness. The effects of the mal mutation are compared to similar mutations recently described in other fish species. The nature and location of the mal gene (carried by <b>heterochromosomes</b> or an autosomal pair) is briefly discussed in view of the knowledge recently acquired on the subject...|$|R

In this work we report the {{characterization of the}} Gymnothorax tile karyotype by conventional chromosome bandings and FISH. Gymnothorax tile (Hamilton, 1822) is an Anguilliform fish belonging to family Murenidae, it lives in brakish waters of Pacific and Indian Oceans. The knowledge on this species is very few and refers only its maintenance in captivity: it has a commercial importance as aquarium fish. We analized eleven females by blood cell culture. More than eighthy metaphases plates have been analyzed by Wright’s staining, C- and CMA 3 - bandings, silver staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (F. I. S. H.). The relative length and centromeric index of each chromosome pair has been measured by the Cromowin System software (TESI imaging) and Levan et al. (1964) chromosome morphology classification has been applied. A 42 chromosomes karyotype was determined, chromosomes have been arranged in two group of pairs: the first comprises 17 meta-submetacentric of decreasing length and the second 4 acrocentric pairs; <b>heterochromosomes</b> were not identified. Telomeric C-bands were present on all acrocentrics but one, and peculiar intercalary bands characterized some biarmed pairs. One Ag-NOR was localized on the p-arm of pair 12, this was also the only region positive both to 45 S rDNA F. I. S. H. and to CMA 3 staining. Karyological studies on the Muraenidae family are very sparse and the karyotype is known only in seven species out of 200 (Nelson, 1994) belonging to 15 genera, present in tropical and temperate seas. Most of the species have 2 n= 42 but with a different karyotype structure; heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported in Gymnothorax eurostus. Within the family, Muraena helena and G. unicolor genomes are the most studied both at a cytogenetic and molecular level; recently replication banding techniques have pointed out numerous chromosomal homeologies and the chromosome rearrangements that occurred {{in the evolution of the}} karyotype between these species.
