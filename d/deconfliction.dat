25|$|As of 2013 three {{international}} naval {{task forces}} operated in the region, with numerous national vessels and task forces entering {{and leaving the}} region, engaging in counter-piracy operations for various lengths of time. The three international task forces which compose the bulk of counter-piracy operations are Combined Task Force 150 (whose overarching mission is Operation Enduring Freedom), Combined Task Force 151 (which {{was set up in}} 2009 specifically to run counter-piracy operations) and the EU naval task force operating under Operation Atalanta. All counter-piracy operations are coordinated through a monthly planning conference called Shared Awareness and <b>Deconfliction</b> (SHADE). Originally having representatives only from NATO, the EU, and the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) HQ in Bahrain, it now regularly attracts representatives from over 20 countries.|$|E
25|$|NATO’s {{success in}} the area was {{due in part to}} the {{cooperation}} of other foreign states with interests in the reason. A lot of these informal connections took place at SHADE meetings.(Shared Awareness and <b>Deconfliction)</b> These meetings allowed for shared tactics among a large of international entities, including China, Indian, Japan, Russia, India and South Korea but is definitely not limited to them. With NATO promoting co-operation amongst these foreign entities, Operation Ocean Shield could effectively protect the area. They also developed this innovative electronic network called Mercury which shared anti-piracy tactics with other task forces and operations. Since this was an informal system, it wasn’t weighed down with bureaucracy and could be spread amongst other coalitions and governmental organizations and could effectively help anyone that needed precise information in the area.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 2008, Chinese {{authorities}} deployed People's Liberation Army Navy {{vessels to}} escort Chinese shipping in the Gulf of Aden. This deployment {{came after a}} series of attacks and attempted hijackings on Chinese vessels by Somali pirates. Reports suggest two destroyers (Type 052C 171 Haikou and Type 052B 169 Wuhan) and a supply ship are the ones being used. This move was welcomed by the international community as the warships complement a multinational fleet already operating along the coast of Africa. Since this operation PLAN has sought the leadership of the ‘Shared Awareness and <b>Deconfliction</b> (SHADE)' body, which would require {{an increase in the number}} of ships contributing to the anti-piracy fleet. This is the first time Chinese warships have deployed outside the Asia-Pacific region for a military operation since Zheng He's expeditions in the 15th century.|$|E
40|$|The Air Force minute sensor {{technology}} integration (MSTI- 3) satellite's primary {{mission is to}} characterize Earth's atmospheric background clutter. MSTI- 3 will use three cameras for data collection, a mid-wave infrared imager, a short wave infrared imager, and a visible imaging spectrometer. Mission science objectives call for the collection of over 2 million images within the one year mission life. In addition, operational constraints limit camera usage to four operations of twenty minutes per day, {{with no more than}} 10, 000 data and calibrating images collected per day. To balance the operational constraints and science objectives, the mission planning team has designed a planning process to e event schedules and sensor operation timelines. Each set of constraints, including spacecraft performance capabilities, the camera filters, the geographical regions, and the spacecraft-Sun-Earth geometries of interest, and remote tracking station <b>deconflictions</b> has been accounted for in this methodology. To aid in this process, the mission planning team is building a series of tools from commercial off-the-shelf software. These include the mission manifest which builds a daily schedule of events, and the MSTI Scene Simulator which helps build geometrically correct scans. These tools provide an efficient, responsive, and highly flexible architecture that maximizes data collection while minimizing mission planning time...|$|R
