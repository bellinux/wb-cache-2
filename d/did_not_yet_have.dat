On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter Michiko Yamamotoknown for films such as Magnifico (2004) and Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros (2006)came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.|$|E

He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. His first task, the level editor Fezzer, was coded from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. Bédard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles ("triles") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D platformer. Bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space.|$|E

At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> a route number were assigned one.

At the time, NY18 entered the hamlet of Morton on Kenmore Road and followed Morton, Redman, and Church Roads and Lake Road West Fork into Hamlin, where it overlapped with NY63 (modern NY19) south along Lake Road to rejoin its modern alignment at Hamlin Center Road. By the following year, NY360 was assigned to what is now NY18 between NY272 and Lake Road (then-NY63) in Hamlin. The alignments of NY18 and NY360 between Morton and Hamlin were flipped , placing both highways on their modern routings.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{surviving}} theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion {{from any of}} the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by Lucas de Heere in 1565 and Karel van Mander in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include Cyriacus Ancona in 1449, Bartolomeo Facio in 1456, and Giovanni Santi in 1482.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford was Premier, {{but had not}} yet {{faced the}} people in an {{election}} and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> a legislature to which he could propose legislation. Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9. The Conservatives, the young province's only other political party, had already selected R. B. Bennett as their leader. Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources {{in the hands of}} the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of separate schools. He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act. The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year. They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular Canadian Pacific Railway, which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth movers were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a concrete bridge over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish the job as it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation of The Bronx was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> a designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E
