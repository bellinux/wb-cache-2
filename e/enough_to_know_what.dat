500|$|Gabe (Zach Woods) {{is taking}} Erin's (Ellie Kemper) public breakup badly. [...] He makes several threats against Andy, who had dated Erin before she dated Gabe, and follows Erin into the women's {{bathroom}} {{to make his}} case. Michael advises Erin {{that she does not}} necessarily need to choose Andy or Gabe, telling her that she is smart <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do.|$|E
500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] was Joss Whedon's {{first attempt}} at writing music, which he {{had always wanted to}} do. He learned how to play guitar to write several songs. Christophe Beck, a regular {{composer}} for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed [...] "Dawn's Ballet". Whedon is a fan of Stephen Sondheim, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode's ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, [...] "Some of Joss' music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it's a Beatles thing. He doesn't know <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he can't do and he's smashing rules." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{was born}} in Bowling Green, Warren County Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He has written and talked {{extensively}} about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues. He is a gay man, and has said, [...] "Ever since I was old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens {{to have been born}} in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from." [...] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a [...] "nonoperative transsexual", Martin would not insist on a pedantic label, writing [...] "I'm just me". In August 2010, he began the process of gender reassignment, and, in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bill Harney {{is a good}} <b>enough</b> guide <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] put in John Barrow. [...] "He {{will pull}} them through somehow--that is, if he <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> remain sober." ...|$|R
60|$|Charles, though {{filled with}} rising fury, was sober <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in <b>what</b> danger he stood, and forcing {{a smile to}} his face, shook hands {{and went out to}} his carriage--alone.|$|R
2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> his {{intentions}} were. Are {{or are not}} our interests conflicting? Tell--me--that!" [...] says Richard, accompanying his last three words with three raps on his rock of trust.|$|E
6000|$|The Major {{understood}} her. [...] "Don't be uneasy, Mrs. Romayne," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{know your}} husband well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you mean. Besides, the news I bring is good news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Times are changed. They were unenlightened {{in those}} old days. My {{grandfather}} was a preacher and, though my father served in the navy, I don't hold with war. Sinful the old gentleman called it--and I think so, too. Unless with Chinamen, or niggers, or such people as must be kept in order and won't listen to reason; having not sense <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> good for them, when it's explained to them by their betters--missionaries, and such like au-tho-ri-ties. But to fight ten years. And for a woman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As usual, Chebron, {{your tongue}} outruns your discretion. This youth understands <b>enough</b> Egyptian <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are saying, {{and it is}} not courteous to speak of a person's {{characteristics}} to his face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be glad that I've <b>enough</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> my rights are," [...] {{retorted}} the Head. [...] "In this cupboard I am leading a simple life, peaceful and dignified, and when a mob of people in whom I am not interested disturb me, they are the disagreeable ones; not I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, boys, {{have your}} own way; you are old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are doing." [...] And now Mr. Rover sank back in the chair, for even this brief {{conversation}} had almost exhausted him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, John, I don't {{think that}} would do any good. In fact, it might do {{a great deal of}} harm," [...] {{declared}} the wife. [...] "Grace is old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she is doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever you do, {{you will}} always be dear to me--that you know. But one thing I {{have a right to}} say, which is, that at my age I am old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is best for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{said this}} in the German language. Mr. George {{understood}} <b>enough</b> of German <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they meant; {{but he could not}} reply in that language. So he said, in French,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Beside--and {{it is an}} honour to Elsley Vavasour, {{amid all}} his weakness, that he had justice and chivalry <b>enough</b> left <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> nine men out of ten ignore--behind all, let the worst come to the worst, lay one just and terrible rejoinder, which he, {{though he had been}} no worse than the average of men, could only answer by silent shame,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Now, it so {{happened}} that John {{was sitting at}} an open window above, and heard occasional snatches of this conversation quite sufficient to impress him disagreeably. He had not heard <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> had been said, but <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> feel that a set of coarse, low-minded men were making quite free with the name and reputation of his Lillie; and he was indignant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} ask you one or two things," [...] she began, not very steadily. [...] "As perhaps you may know, I was brought up in this church, baptized and {{confirmed}} in it. I've come to fear that, when I was confirmed, I wasn't old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I was doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I'll bet {{you would}} {{if you had}} me alone. But these outlaws--these sheep-thieves--these tools you hire are better than you and Riggs.... What do you suppose Carmichael will do to you? Carmichael! He's my sweetheart--that cowboy. You {{know what he did}} to Riggs. Have you brains <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he'll do to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop it!" [...] said Sir Percival, rudely {{turning his}} back on us. [...] "If you haven't sense <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is best for {{yourself}} other people must know it for you. The arrangement is made {{and there is an}} end of it. You are only wanted to do what Miss Halcombe has done for you---" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She seems a very {{sensible}} young lady," [...] {{he declared}} slowly. [...] "I {{should have thought}} {{that she would have}} been old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> for herself <b>what</b> she wanted and what was best for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have tried}} not <b>to!</b> You said <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>what</b> had caused it. I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness, my poor Jude! And I am glad you have come!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "The {{whole idea}} {{is that you have}} that nostalgic night out, so people who are older can listen to it too. None of us are naive <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> kids do. It’s {{important}} not to patronise the youth of today, we’re not gonna be writing about ‘oh let’s just hold hands for a while’ you know? They need their music to connect. A lot of songs are about sex {{and you have to be}} realistic about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sick {{of being}} disbelieved," [...] he said impatiently, and {{suddenly}} unbuttoning his wretched coat {{he pulled out}} a little canvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown pebble. [...] "I wonder if you know <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> that is?" [...] He handed it to me.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{the love}} of woman! That is a hard saying. What love can pass that? Yet David doubtless spoke truth. He {{was a man who}} must have had reason <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> woman's love was like; and when he said that {{the love of}} Jonathan for him passed even that, he {{bestowed}} on his friend praise which will be immortal.|$|E
6000|$|The knight laughed. [...] "Wages, poor lad, {{what should}} he do with them? He is but a slave, I tell you. Meat, clothes, and fire, that is all he needs, and I will so deal with him that he will serve you in all {{faithfulness}} and obedience. He can speak English <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you bid him do, but not enough for chatter with the servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [51] I do {{not speak}} of the true dome, because I have not studied its [...] {{construction}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> at <b>what</b> largeness of scale it begins to [...] be rather {{a tour de force}} than a convenient or natural form of [...] roof, and because the ordinary spectator's choice among its various [...] outlines must always be dependent on æsthetic considerations only, [...] and can in no wise be grounded on any conception of its infinitely [...] complicated structural principles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you suppose}} I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the toll is?" [...] {{said the woman}} in the carriage. [...] "I'm sure I've {{traveled}} over this road often <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that. But <b>what</b> I'm thinkin' about is the difference between what I thought the captain's niece was and what she really is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some one get cheated!" [...] he exclaimed, laughing. [...] "Every {{one gets}} cheated, {{as you call}} it, if they haven't <b>enough</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> their property's worth, {{and how to use}} it to the best advantage. It's a case," [...] he announced, [...] "of the {{survival}} of the fittest. Which reminds me that if I'm going to be fit to-morrow I'd better go to bed. Mr. Wing's to take me to New York on his yacht, and you've got to have your wits about you when you talk to the old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I take it {{that people}} are bright <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are doing," [...] {{returned}} Matt. [...] "We are too busy to talk about our neighbors. We are here to show what we have and sell goods--if we can. We do not misrepresent, and if any one is dissatisfied with his purchase he can return it and get his money back. Isn't that fair enough?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The other stopped {{buttoning}} Lemuel's trousers round him to slap {{himself on}} the thigh. [...] "Why, mate! don't you know <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a sea voyage is? Why, I've been down to the Island {{for the last six}} months! Hain't you never heard it called a sea voyage? Why, we always come off from a cruise when we git back! You don't mean to say you never been one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Gibault," [...] whispered Bounce, [...] "you'll have {{to remain}} here. Get into a hiding-place {{as fast as you}} can, and keep close. You're clever <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do, and when to do it. Only, lad, come near and have your knife handy when the row is at the loudest, and see that ye don't let the squaws cut out our livers when we're tied up." ...|$|E
60|$|And it did. I say it {{with all}} modesty, but it did. Of course, it all seems obvious <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> you who <b>know</b> <b>what</b> occurred, {{but it was not}} so very clear when {{everything}} was new. But it came on me suddenly with the full force of absolute conviction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why has she {{not some}} of her family with her, poor thing!" [...] my wife continued. [...] "She perishes in that solitude. Her husband {{prevents}} her, I think--and--oh--I <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> of him <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> his life is. I shudder, Arthur, to see you take the hand of that wicked, selfish man. You must break with him, do you hear, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how can I?" [...] {{she asked}} plaintively. [...] "I cannot {{go to see}} these people, nor can I have them come here. I don't {{know how much money}} they want. You know I haven't a penny of my own, and {{although}} my husband is generous <b>enough,</b> he likes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I want money for. I have spent my allowance for the whole of the year already. I believe I am even in debt." ...|$|R
