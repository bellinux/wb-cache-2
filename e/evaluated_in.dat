5|$|Doxorubicin and {{daunorubicin}} together can {{be thought}} of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been <b>evaluated</b> <b>in</b> the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{vehicles}} were <b>evaluated</b> <b>in</b> the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). The four primary vehicles {{included in the}} AOA were the M2A3 Bradley II, a modernized Stryker, an M2A3 Bradley variant used in Iraq, and a XM1230 Caiman Plus MRAP. The five secondary vehicles included two unnamed foreign-made platforms, the M1126 Stryker Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M1A2 SEP TUSK Abrams, and a modernized M1 Abrams. Vehicles included the AOA were determined to be inferior to the planned GCV.|$|E
