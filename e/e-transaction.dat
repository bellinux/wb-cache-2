40|$|E-commerce, {{especially}} <b>e-transactions,</b> {{is hardly}} exploited in Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka's literacy rate is high, <b>e-transactions</b> usage lags way behind Asian countries with comparable literacy. Its potential to benefit society and improve {{quality of life}} has not been realized. The reasons are not clear. Low {{public awareness of the}} benefits of ecommerce is no doubt a major factor, but even the people who have initiated are not without reservations. Lack of confidence and trust in internet security and the merchants, delays in delivery and poor infrastructure are among their concerns. Perceived risk is likely to depend on their cultural and educational background, age, income level etc. The objectives of this research were to assess Sri Lankans' readiness for <b>e-transactions,</b> determine the seminal factors, and develop an appropriate model to predict social readiness. A conceptual framework was developed with social readiness for <b>e-transactions</b> as the dependent variable and perceived benefit, perceived risk, ICT trust, internet access and internet experience as independent variables. A specially designed questionnaire was used to gather data from a random sample of IT professionals in Colombo district, with internet access. A very high correlation was observed between social readiness for <b>e-transactions</b> and perceived benefit, ICT trust, internet experience and internet access. A model with very high predictability was developed to predict social readiness for <b>e-transactions.</b> Findings clearly establish that social readiness for <b>e-transactions</b> is positively related to perceived benefit and ICT trust, and importantly, perceived risk was not an influencing factor. Lowe-transactions usage is evidently due to inadequate knowledge and points to the need to educate the general public about internet security measures and benefits of <b>e-transactions.</b> A concerted effort from government, banks, commercial establishments etc. is necessary to promote business over the internet.

40|$|An <b>e-Transaction</b> is {{one that}} executes exactly-once despite failures. This paper {{describes}} a distributed protocol that implements the abstraction of e-Transactions in three-tier architectures. Three-tier architectures are typically Internet-oriented architectures, where the end-user interacts with front-end clients (e. g., browsers) that invoke middle-tier application servers (e. g., web servers) to access back-end databases. We implement the <b>e-Transaction</b> abstraction using an asynchronous replication scheme that preserves the three-tier nature of the architecture and introduces a very acceptable overhead with respect to unreliable solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} {{reliability}} issues in three-tier systems with stateless application servers. For these systems, a framework called <b>e-Transaction</b> has been recently proposed, which specifies {{a set of}} desirable end-to-end reliability guarantees.

Differently from existing proposals coping with the <b>e-Transaction</b> framework, our protocol does not rely on any assumption on the accuracy of failure detection. Hence, it reveals suited for a wider class of distributed systems. To achieve such a target, our protocol exploits an innovative scheme for distributed transaction management (based on ad hoc demarcation and concurrency control mechanisms), which we introduce in this paper. Beyond providing the proof of protocol correctness, we also discuss hints on the protocol integration with conventional systems (e. g., database systems) and show the minimal overhead imposed by the protocol...|$|E

Zulaikha, M. Si., Akt, Advisor II : DR. Drs. Agus Purwanto, M. Si. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to test empirically the influence of collaborative technologies on firm performance through intranet use orientation (e-information, e- communication and <b>e-transaction).</b> Whereas the application of collaborative technologies consisted of two groups; they were electronic communicatioin system (ECS) and teamwork system (TS). From those two groups, the researh was focused on four categorizes, consisting of discussion forum, share database, repositories and workflow. Whereas the field research, was obtained by mail survey method, and was sent to services and manufactures company in Java, which had been implementing intranet technologies. The respondent’s choice was focused on the Director (CEO) or the branch chief, Operational Manager, Personal Manager, Finance Manager and IT/EDP manager. Analytical tools used in {{this research}} were ANOVA and Regression. The result showed that only discussion forum, share databased, and workflow variable had significantly the relationship with the intranet use orientation variable (e- information, e-communication and <b>e-transaction).</b> Whereas repositories variable was not related directly to the intranet use orientation variable. Partially the t-test result, showed that the e-information and e-communication variable did not significantly influence the firm performance. However, the <b>e-transaction</b> had significant influence at 0. 05 with the probability of 0. 07.

Abstract—Previous studies on <b>E-transaction</b> time-series have mainly focused on finding temporal trends of transaction behavior. Interesting transactions that are time-stamped and situation-relevant may easily be obscured in {{a large amount of}} information. This paper proposes a visual analytics system, Visual Analysis of <b>E-transaction</b> Time-Series (VAET), that allows the analysts to interactively explore large transaction datasets for insights about time-varying transactions. With a set of analyst-determined training samples, VAET automatically estimates the saliency of each transaction in a large time-series using a probabilistic decision tree learner. It provides an effective time-of-saliency (TOS) map where the analysts can explore a large number of transactions at different time granularities. Interesting transactions are further encoded with KnotLines, a compact visual representation that captures both the temporal variations and the contextual connection of transactions. The analysts can thus explore, select, and investigate knotlines of interest. A case study and user study with a real E-transactions dataset (26 million records) demonstrate the effectiveness of VAET. Index Terms—Time-Series, Visual Analytics, <b>E-transaction...</b>|$|E
40|$|International and {{regional}} organizations and governments are increasingly interested in regulation of information technology. Laws {{are needed for}} <b>e-transactions</b> to combat electronic crimes and address issues related to cyberspace and Internet users. There has been an acceleration in the issuance of legislation governing this area. The laws are aimed at dealing with legal issues, removal of barriers, and increasing consumer confidence in such technology. This research is primarily designed to evaluate Law No. 20 of 2014 Concerning <b>E-transactions</b> in Kuwait. The aim is to study how effective the law has been in achieving its objectives. The analysis is conducted through an exploration of e-commerce and transactions as addressed in Kuwaiti law. This law and its executive by-law were the first laws regulating <b>e-transactions</b> which emerged after an absence of any special laws regulating such matters. The main objective of this research defines the concept of e-commerce, its importance, {{its relationship to the}} law and the obstacles it confronts. The analysis also covers several legal issues arising from the emergence of e-commerce. There are legal issues for <b>e-transactions</b> listed in Law No. 20 of 2014, which includes e-contracts, e-signatures, privacy and data protection. Thus, it is important to identify shortcomings in the law affecting its required role. Finally, recommendations are put forward {{for the development of a}} legal framework. This research utilizes a comparative study approach to evaluate Law No. 20 of 2014. A comparison is done with relevant laws in the United Kingdom, which is more established in this area. Other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) laws are also considered whenever necessary. There are several laws in the UK that cover similar relevant issues to those addressed by Law No. 20 of 2014. Given the novelty of the law, judicial consideration cannot be assessed until a reasonable period has passed after application of its articles. The recent issue of laws related to <b>e-transactions,</b> including related technical terms, need be given attention at all levels of the judiciary. This must be done to ensure proper application of the law, public awareness, and knowledge in academic and educational circles. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed abstraction, called <b>e-Transaction</b> (exactly-once Transaction), specifies a set {{of properties}} capturing end-to-end reliability aspects for three-tier Web-based systems. In this {{paper we propose a}} distributed protocol ensuring the <b>e-Transaction</b> properties for the general case of multiple, autonomous back-end databases. The key idea underlying our proposal consists in distributing, across the back-end tier, some recovery information reflecting the transaction processing state. This information is manipulated at low cost via local operations at the database side, with no need for any form of coordination among asynchronous replicas of the application server within the middle-tier. Compared to existing solutions, our protocol has therefore the distinguishing features of being both very light and highly scalable. The latter aspect makes our proposal particularly attractive for the case of very high degree of replication of the application access point, with distribution of the replicas within infrastructures geographically spread on public networks over the Internet (e. g., Application Delivery Networks), namely, a configuration that also provides the advantages of reduced user perceived latency and increased system availability...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to determine the influence of culture on e-government (electronic government) acceptance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Citizens' transactional interactions (electronic transactions or e-transactions) with the government via the Internet are examined. Multiple models and theories in extant literature were referred to in identifying the research context requirements that enabled the analysis of <b>e-transaction</b> acceptance. A new research model that fits the research context was developed to predict and explain how acceptance is affected. A sample of 671 Saudi citizens was recruited using an online survey. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the impact on intention to use e-transactions. Preference for using e-transactions as a communication method, perceptions of the compatibility of e-transactions with values and citizens' needs, communicability of the results of using e-transactions, trust in the Internet as a medium of communication with the government, and conservation values are positive significant determinants of <b>e-transaction</b> acceptance. Conversely, the influence of trust in government agencies and motivation towards gaining prestige and possessing dominance over people and resources was negative.
