5000|$|Purple-K, {{also known}} as PKP, is a dry-chemical fire {{suppression}} agent used in some dry chemical fire extinguishers. It {{is the second most}} effective dry chemical in fighting class B (flammable liquid) fires after Monnex (potassium allophanate), and can be used against some energized electrical equipment <b>fires</b> (USA <b>class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fires).</b> It has about 4-5 times more effectiveness against <b>class</b> B <b>fires</b> than carbon dioxide, and more than twice that of sodium bicarbonate. Some fire extinguishers are capable of operation in temperatures down to −54 °C or up to +49 °C. Dry chemical works by directly inhibiting the chemical chain reaction which forms one of the four sides of the fire tetrahedron (heat + oxygen + fuel + chemical chain reaction = fire). To a much smaller degree it also has a smothering effect by excluding oxygen from the fire. [...] "Dry chemical" [...] extinguishers, such as Purple-K, are different from [...] "dry powder" [...] extinguishers that are used to fight Class D flammable metal fires.|$|R

These <b>fires</b> (<b>Class</b> B in the American system; <b>Classes</b> B and <b>C</b> in the European and Australian systems) include the burning of gasoline, oil, propane, and natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{extinguishers}} - There {{are five}} different classes of fires; A, B, C, D, and K. Class A consists of burning paper, wood, cloth or other combustible solids. Class B consists of liquids and gasses such as propane. <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fires</b> consist of electrical <b>fires.</b> While <b>class</b> D <b>fires</b> (which is less common) consists of burning metal and <b>class</b> K <b>fires</b> (the most common) consists of kitchen type materials, i.e., grease and oil.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Class</b> B <b>fires</b> are {{distinguished}} from the other <b>fire</b> classes: <b>Class</b> A <b>fires</b> ("ordinary combustibles" [...] such as wood, paper, or rubber); <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fires</b> (in which the burning material is energized electrical equipment) and <b>Class</b> D <b>fires</b> (in which the burning material is combustible metals).

In Montana, <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> athletics have a complex structure due to {{the large number of}} schools and the extensive geographic distances involved. <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> play is organized into divisions, with each division having two or more districts: Eastern Division (districts 2 and 3), Southern Division (districts 4 and 6), Northern Division (districts 7, 8, 9, and 10), and Western Division (districts 11/12, 13, and 14). Each district (which contains six to 11 schools) holds a district tournament, sending two or four winners (depending on the number of schools in the district) to the divisional tournament. [...] Each division holds a divisional tournament, sending two teams to the state tourney. Great Falls is located geographically in the <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> Northern Division.

40|$|SummaryPlasmid-mediated <b>class</b> <b>C</b> β-lactamases are {{reported}} from Enterobacteriaceae with increasing frequency. They likely originate from chromosomal AmpC of certain Gram-negative bacterial species and subsequently are mobilized onto transmissible plasmids. There {{are reports of}} unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients infected with these organisms and treated with broad-spectrum cephalosporins. However, unlike class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), no screening and confirmatory tests have been uniformly established for strains that produce <b>class</b> <b>C</b> β-lactamases. Reduced susceptibility to cefoxitin is a sensitive but not specific indicator of <b>class</b> <b>C</b> β-lactamase production. Simple confirmatory tests including tests using boronic acid compounds as specific <b>class</b> <b>C</b> β-lactamase inhibitors have recently been developed. Their utilization will enable clinical microbiology laboratories to report those strains producing plasmid-mediated <b>class</b> <b>C</b> β-lactamases as being resistant to all broad-spectrum cephalosporins, thus allowing physicians to prescribe appropriate antimicrobial therapy...|$|R
