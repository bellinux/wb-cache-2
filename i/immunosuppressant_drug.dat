25|$|Globally, {{pioneering}} {{experimental studies}} in the surgical technique of human organ transplantation {{were made in the}} early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, and successful transplants starting spreading worldwide after the Second World War. China herself began organ transplantation in the 1960s, which grew to an annual peak of over 13,000 transplants in 2004; and, despite some deaths from infection and hepatitis, the transplant programme has been successful in saving many lives. Though the number of transplants fell to under 11,000 annually by 2005, China still has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world. China explores innovative surgery, such as the world's first flesh and bone face transplant, performed by Professor Guo Shuzhong. Organ donation, however, has met resistance, and involuntary organ donation is illegal under Chinese law, as it is against Chinese tradition and culture, which attach symbolic life affirming importance to the kidney and heart. China is not alone in encountering donation difficulties; demand outstrips supply in most countries. The world-wide shortage has encouraged some countries—such as India—to trade in human organs. Reports of organs being removed from executed prisoners in China for sale internationally had been circulating since the mid-1980s, when a 1984 regulation made it legal to harvest organs from convicted criminals with the consent of the family or if the body goes unclaimed. Development of an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug,</b> cyclosporine A, made transplants a more viable option for patients.|$|E

50|$|Prednisone is a {{synthetic}} corticosteroid drug {{that is particularly}} effective as an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug.</b> It is used to treat certain inflammatory diseases (such as moderate allergic reactions), some autoimmune diseases, and (at higher doses) some types of cancer, but it has significant adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Muromonab-CD3 (trade name Orthoclone OKT3, marketed by Janssen-Cilag) is an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> {{given to}} reduce acute {{rejection}} {{in patients with}} organ transplants.

50|$|First-line {{treatment}} for CIDP nowadays is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) {{and other treatments}} include corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) which may be prescribed alone or in combination with an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug.</b> Recent controlled studies show subcutaneous immunoglobin (SCIG) appears to be as effective for CIDP treatment as IVIG in most patients, and with fewer systemic side effects.|$|E

30|$|Management of {{patients}} by using <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs</b> after BC diagnosis {{is a matter}} of concern. The therapeutic benefit of reducing the dose of <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs</b> in patients with solid organ tumors is controversial (Self et al. 2006). In some studies, CNI use was not a risk factor of any type of malignancy (Marcen et al. 2003). Moreover, the overall amount of immunosuppressant may not lead to an increased incidence of BC (Buell et al. 2002). These findings suggest that decreasing the dose or discontinuation of immunosuppressants may be unnecessary for the KTRs with BC after diagnosis. In our cases, the dose of immunosuppresants remained unchanged after BC diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Mycophenolic acid, less {{accurately}} called mycophenolate, is an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> used {{to prevent}} rejection in organ transplantation. It inhibits an enzyme needed {{for the growth of}} T cells and B cells. It was initially marketed as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to improve oral bioavailability. More recently, the salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Mycophenolate mofetil is marketed under the trade name CellCept and mycophenolate sodium as Myfortic.|$|E
5000|$|Voclosporin is an {{experimental}} <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> {{being developed by}} Aurinia Pharmaceuticals. It is being studied as a potential treatment for lupus nephritis (LN) and uveitis. [...] It is an analog of ciclosporin that has enhanced action against calcineurin and greater metabolic stability. [...] Voclosporin was discovered by Robert T. Foster and his team at Isotechnika in the mid 1990s. [...] Isotechnika was founded in 1993 and merged with Aurinia Pharmaceuticals in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Chlorambucil is a {{chemotherapy}} drug {{normally used}} to treat leukemia as it is often used as an <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug,</b> and prednisone is a steroid that has also {{been found to be}} particularly effective as an immunosuppressant. This combination of drugs has minimal to no benefits in most patients, but a small number do see small improvements such as decreased tremors. This combination has not been very effective in more severe cases, though, and is not considered a long term therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Immunodeficiency {{is also a}} {{potential}} adverse effect of many <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> in this sense, {{the scope of the}} term immunosuppression in general includes both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system ...|$|R
50|$|Transplant {{rejection}} {{occurs when}} transplanted tissue is {{rejected by the}} recipient's immune system, which destroys the transplanted tissue. Transplant rejection can be lessened by determining the molecular similitude between donor and recipient and by use of <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs</b> after transplant.|$|R
30|$|Nine {{patients}} (9.9  %) {{were under}} <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> including cyclophosphamide and azathioprine; six patients (6.6  %) with CNS involvement were under antiepileptics. However, 20 patients (21.9  %) were without any medication {{as they were}} referred to the eye department to rule out any contraindication before starting hydroxychloroquine.|$|R
50|$|Tolypocladium inflatum is an ascomycete fungus {{originally}} {{isolated from}} a Norwegian soil sample that, under certain conditions, produces the <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> ciclosporin. In its sexual stage (teleomorph) it is a parasite on scarab beetles. It forms a small, compound ascocarp that {{arises from the}} cadaver of its host beetle. In its asexual stage (anamorph) it is a white mold that grows on soil. It is much more commonly found in its asexual stage {{and this is the}} stage that was originally given the name Tolypocladium inflatum.|$|E
50|$|The <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> {{cyclosporin}} A blocks a calcium-dependent {{signal from}} the T-cell receptor (TCR) that normally leads to T-cell activation. When bound to cyclophilin B, cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signaling intermediate calcineurin. The protein encoded by this gene functions similarly to cyclosporin A, binding to cyclophilin B and acting downstream of the TCR and upstream of calcineurin by causing an influx of calcium. This integral membrane protein {{appears to be a}} new participant in the calcium signal transduction pathway, implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signaling, {{even in the absence of}} cyclosporin.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013, federal {{prosecutors}} filed two lawsuits against Novartis under the False Claims Act for off-label marketing and kickbacks; in both suits, prosecutors are seeking treble damages. The first suit [...] "accused Novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drug</b> Myfortic {{in exchange for}} kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts". In the second, the Justice Department joined a qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over off-label marketing of three drugs: Lotrel and Valturna (both hypertension drugs), and the diabetes drug, Starlix. Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia and Chicago and New York also joined.|$|E
50|$|The {{cornerstone}} of therapy is reduction in immunosuppression. A recent surge in BKVAN correlates {{with use of}} potent <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Studies have not shown any correlation between BKVAN and a single immunosuppressive agent but rather the overall immunosuppressive load.|$|R
25|$|Hygiene {{becomes more}} {{important}} in everyday living due to the <b>immunosuppressant</b> <b>drugs</b> which are required every day to prevent transplant rejection. Lack of a strong immune system leaves transplant recipients vulnerable to infections. Care {{must be taken into}} food preparation and hygiene as gastroenteritis becomes more of a risk.|$|R

Analgesia must {{be good enough to}} avoid increasing oxygen consumption of myocardium. In addition, intravenous fluids must be well maintained, and urine output monitored.|$|R
