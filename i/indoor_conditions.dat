In fact, residential and non-residential buildings, become a subject to significant cooling necessities due to the high intensity of heat passing from building external envelope, the rely on mechanical cooling systems to provide best <b>indoor</b> <b>condition</b> was directed to increase the energy consumption. Due to this fact, many designers highlighted the potential influence of courtyards as a natural cooling technique to enhance indoor comfort for building users and consequently minimize space-cooling conditioning. This research investigates the courtyard attributes as a natural cooling technique in tropical climates, to provide <b>indoor</b> thermal <b>condition</b> at single, double and three-story buildings; furthermore, to achieve low energy office buildings in Kuala Lumpur and Johor. The research objectives are to investigate the history of the courtyard in Malaysia, to evaluate <b>indoor</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> at office buildings and finally to assess, the effectiveness of a courtyard on conserving energy in office buildings in Malaysia. The research method is a combination of literature review, environmental measurement, post occupancy evaluation and energy consumption data. To achieve the first objective of this research previous study assessed to gain information of the courtyard at vernacular architecture, contemporary vernacular and modern architecture in Malaysia, it started before independence in 1957 and transformed through time until the dawn of the new millennium. Furthermore, several environmental aspects such as air temperatures, relative humidity, and air velocity were measured using a portable instrument (Lutron LM 8000) and thermal comfort station (BABUC A).

In present paper, the cooling and dehumidification abilities of an air-conditioning unit are integrated to a capacity chart of a surface air cooler in air conditioning. This new chart shares several parameters such as dry-bulb temperature (DB), humidity ratio, relative humidity (RH), specific enthalpy of air and capacity coordinates as well as sensible and latent heat load (cooling and dehumidification capacity). The sensible and latent heat loads of indoor air, the transient air-conditioning processes and the equilibrium state of indoor air given by a surface air cooler in different indoor sensible and latent heat loads are illustrated on the capacity chart of a surface air cooler. Taking a six rows JW 20 - 4 type surface air cooler for example to introduce how to obtain the cooling and dehumidification chart and how to use the chart. If the required <b>indoor</b> <b>condition</b> DB is 27 ± 1 °C and RH is 50 ± 5 %, the appropriate operating range can be found by using the cooling and dehumidification chart...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to model a TEG in COMSOL Multiphysics and study the characteristic of thermal energy harvesters and the influence of environment variables on thermal energy harvesters in <b>indoor</b> <b>condition.</b> The results of the thesis show that higher air flow speed at the same temperature gradient or bigger temperature difference at the same air flow speed both can lead to obtain better output performance of the TEG with 1. 6 ohm purely resistive load. Using heat sinks also can lead to obtain better output performance of TEG. Different heat sink geometries have been investigated and it is shown that the square angled fin has better performance for cooling down than squared fin and pin fin when comparing the influence of different heat sink structures. Compering the influence of different air flow directions, the direction of air flow has negligible influence on the pin fin heat sink, but has great influence on the square angled fin heat sink and the squared fin heat sink. Compering the influence of different heat sink materials, the copper heat sink has an almost negligible influence on performance for cooling down than the aluminum heat sink, it is obvious that it has been improved by 4 %. For the pin fin heat sinks investigation, with the same size of pin in the same area, the air gap between two pins properly increases, the cooling down performance of pin fin heat sink can be improved by 30 %...|$|R
