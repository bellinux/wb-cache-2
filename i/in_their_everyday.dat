5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 and {{especially}} in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became {{a focal point for}} the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting Will He Round the Point?. Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn's art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives and making full use of colour. Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing {{the other members of the}} group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.|$|E

25|$|Even when {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} correctly applied, {{the results can}} be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise.

25|$|While the Abbasids {{originally}} gained {{power by}} exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, ironically during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized. As knowledge was {{shared in the}} Arabic language throughout the empire, people of different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} serious {{theological}} differences emerged between the Sadducees and Pharisees.

Unlike the Sadducees, the Pharisees also believed in (and introduced) the concept of the Resurrection of the Dead in a future, Messianic Age or World to Come. These beliefs seem to have influenced Christians' belief in a resurrected Jesus.|$|E
40|$|Food {{quality has}} become an {{important}} topic in the food market. Thus, suppliers have started offering conventional products including additional quality attributes, such as “free from GMO” or “free from additives”. We analysed the preferences and buying behaviour regarding such conventional “low-input” products in competition with conventional and organic product alternatives in consumer choice experiments in Germany and Switzerland. In the experiments, we tested milk, yogurt and apples. The choice experiments were combined with face-to-face interviews in order to collect information about the participating consumers, which might explain the buying behaviour observed in the choice experiment. We found that low-input products rather compete with conventional than with organic products, because the low-input alternative was mainly chosen by consumers, who also <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday’s</b> life buy the respective product in conventional quality. Furthermore, variances in the buying behaviour observed mainly depend on consumers’ attitudes of food quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present project is to inquire into the {{everyday}} life of refugees in Danish society. Such an inquiry is of immediate interest {{in the context of the}} ongoing refugee crisis and the resulting political debate. The project will be based on two qualitative interviews, and the refugees’ experience of everyday life (hverdagsliv) in Danish society is investigated using critical psychology and first person perspective (første-persons perspektiv). The empirical data will be related to concepts introduced by the critical psychologists, Klaus Holzkamp and Ole Dreier; these concepts include among others day-to-day way of life, consistency of actions (handlesammenhænge), context (kontekst), and participation (deltagelse). In the study of these concepts, themes like language, education, and employment have been found relevant. In addition to the concepts originating from critical psychology, the concepts of inclusion, exclusion, and integration are applied in the analysis of the interviewees’ experience of life in the Danish society. Furthermore, the relevant themes are discussed in relation to established criteria of good integration in order to relate the experiences of the interviewees within a broader societal context. It is concluded in the project that the everyday life of refugees <b>in</b> <b>their</b> new country is influenced by <b>their</b> earlier <b>everyday</b> life <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective home countries. The day-to-day way of life, the consistency of actions, and the contexts they entered into <b>in</b> <b>their</b> home country affect the way in which the refugees organise <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> life <b>in</b> Denmark. <b>In</b> addition, <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> life is influenced by the societal conditions they face as refugees. It is, however, important to note that, despite these conditions, the refugees take an active part <b>in</b> creating <b>their</b> own life while manoeuvring between earlier consistency of actions (handlesammenhænge) and societal conditions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> current <b>everyday</b> life...|$|R
25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E
25|$|Malayan tapirs {{have very}} poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their {{excellent}} {{sense of smell}} and hearing to go about <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises {{on either side of}} their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E
25|$|The {{largest single}} {{category}} of hate {{crimes in the}} United States are committed against African Americans: of the 8,208 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2010, 48% were race related – with 70% of those having an anti-black bias. This {{is believed to be}} based on the history of African slavery in this country. One of the largest waves of hate crimes took place during the Civil Rights Movement. During the 1950s and 1960s, both violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this social class faced violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining segregation. At the time, civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the Civil War, and the humiliation of this social class was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin. At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.|$|E

40|$|With the {{invention}} and rapid improvement of data-capturing devices, such as satellite imagery and digital cameras, {{the information that}} archaeologists must manage <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday’s</b> activities has rapidly grown in complexity and amount. In this work we present Indiana Finder, an interactive visualization system that supports archaeologists in the examination of large repositories of documents and drawings. In particular, the system provides visual analytic support for investigative analysis such as the interpretation of new archaeological findings, the detection of interpretation anomalies, and the discovery of new insights. We illustrate the potential of Indiana Finder {{in the context of}} the digital protection and conservation of rock art natural and cultural heritage sites. In this domain, Indiana Finder provides an integrated environment that archaeologists can exploit to investigate, discover, and learn from textual documents, pictures, and drawings related to rock carvings. This goal is accomplished through novel visualization methods including visual similarity ring charts that may help archaeologists in the hard task of dating a symbol in a rock engraving based on its shape and on the surrounding symbols...|$|R

500|$|Early cricketers played <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> {{clothes and}} had no {{protective}} equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes {{with the addition of}} a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to [...] "give the ball air" [...] by pitching it. As a result, [...] "the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre-modern phase".|$|E
500|$|Nocturne {{expanded}} on {{the general}} Megami Tensei theme of people lacking excitement <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> lives, with Nocturne focusing on the extraordinary events people could not experience in real life. The team wanted Nocturne {{to feel like a}} [...] "journey into hell" [...] comparable with Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Kaneko was mainly responsible for creating the inverted bubble structure of the Vortex World. This design choice was primarily inspired by similar ideas in Gnostic traditions, early science fiction, and the Heart Sutra, an important scripture within Mahayana Buddhism. In contrast to previous games which offered three routes for the cast, Chaos was the only affiliation of the characters. This was due to the fact the staff saw the Chaos route offered more to the player, {{and that it would be}} boring to have the same designs as previous games. It also gave the team more development freedom. Another reason was that Shin Megami Tensei II had already explored a world governed by Law, so it seemed natural to swing the other way and depict a world ruled by Chaos. In addition, Kaneko stated that Nocturne was part of a movement to create a single unified mythos for the Megami Tensei series. One of the main aspects of incorporating this theme were discussions about the nature of chaos.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to complicate and {{raise questions about}} Black masculinity and hip hop. It contains information gathered for ethnographic interviews conducted with rap artists. In these interviews, one can see that issues of performance of gender and gender authenticity are central. This thesis addresses how interview subjects negotiate the internal differences between their rap persona and <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> identity. As both a teacher, student and a rap artist, these are questions I am attempting to reconcile for myself; thus, I am not absent from the research. This thesis concludes that artists are reluctant to call their own rap persona a performance, for fear {{that it would be}} acknowledging that it was somehow an 'act' or not 'real'. My informants describe their rap identity with words like "aggressive" and <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> persona as "patient". When asked about what characterizes a 'real' man, they nearly always use the same words they used <b>in</b> describing <b>their</b> <b>everyday</b> persona.
