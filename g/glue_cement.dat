During the last 24 Conferences at least 170 papers have been presented by International Experts on these simple devices that range in length from 30 -inches to 20 ft and from 5 / 8 to 2 inches in diameter. Roof bolts are primarily mechanically anchored, <b>glued,</b> <b>cemented,</b> or driven. Bolts are placed vertically, angled, or tied together with special fixtures (trusses and slings).

The use of force may also be used, such as with magnets, vacuum (like suction cups), or even friction. Some types of woodworking joints make use of separate internal reinforcements, such as dowels or biscuits, which in a sense can be considered fasteners within the scope of the joint system, although on their own they are not general purpose fasteners. Furniture supplied in flat-pack form often uses cam dowels locked by cam locks, also known as conformat fasteners. Fasteners {{can also be used to}} close a container such as a bag, a box, or an envelope; or they may involve keeping together the sides of an opening of flexible material, attaching a lid to a container, etc. There are also special-purpose closing devices, e.g. a bread clip.|$|R

25|$|Other {{materials}} used, were Tonkin bamboo Calcutta reed, ash wood, hickory, ironwood, maple, lancewood, or malacca cane. These {{products were}} light, tough, and pliable. Rods were generally made in three pieces called a butt, midsection, and tip. The butts were frequently made of maple, with bored bottom; this butt outlasted several tops. Midsections were generally made from ironwood {{because it was}} a thicker, strong wood. Tips were generally made from bamboo for its elasticity which could throw the bait further and more accurately. Handles and grips were generally of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Many different types of glue held these sections together, most commonly Irish glue and bone glue. This was until hilton <b>glue,</b> or <b>cement</b> <b>glue,</b> was introduced because of its waterproof qualities. Even today, Tonkin split-bamboo rods are still popular in fly fishing.|$|R

CS and other stratum corneum lipids were extracted from the palm and the upper arm (n = 22) by a cup method and determined by our improved high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Despite a great difference in the magnitude of cohesion (p < 0. 01), CS levels and ratios of CS to ceramides and CS to cholesterol in the stratum corneum showed {{no significant differences between}} the palm and the upper arm.

The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive.

40|$|AbstractIntrinsically disordered {{proteins}} (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) {{are important}} constituents of many protein complexes, playing various structural, functional, and regulatory roles. In such disorder-based protein complexes, functional disorder is used both internally (for assembly, movement, and functional {{regulation of the}} different parts of a given complex) and externally (for interactions of a complex with its external regulators). In complex assembly, IDPs/IDPRs serve as the molecular <b>glue</b> that <b>cements</b> complexes or as highly flexible scaffolds. Disorder defines the order of complex assembly {{and the ability of}} a protein to be involved in polyvalent interactions. It {{is at the heart of}} various binding mechanisms and interaction modes ascribed to IDPs.

The composite specimens are composed of cement paste connected to plywood using epoxy <b>glue.</b> The <b>cement</b> paste is subjected to autogeneous shrinkage and the wood is subjected to imbibition test. Plywood is used so that the swelling deformations due to the imbibition process are parallel to the connection plane.

Global strains above and below the glue interface have been measured and have been compared to the free strains. We showed that there are restrained deformations at the glue interface and that the cement paste is damaged. Local strains have been characterized by means of the digital image correlation technique. We showed in particular that the deformations in wood are related to the microstructure of the layers of plywood and that the restrained deformations at the glue interface lead to a bending of the cement paste. In the case of strong adhesion properties, this bending induces cracking in cement paste...|$|R

The probable explanation is that the eggs developing in the female uterus are pumped by the female or sucked by the male to the cloacal opening and from this point to the intestine and ejaculatory duct. The male probably does not have the ability to expel the eggs and for this reason a large number were found in these organs. On the other hand, this could be an important adaptation for the parasite, i. e. male worms expelled by the host can carry a large number of eggs and spread them to intermediate hosts when ingested by these hosts.
