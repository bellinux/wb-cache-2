5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperature</b> falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

25|$|Also, a net {{condensation}} {{of water}} vapor occurs on surfaces {{when the temperature}} of the surface is at or below the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperature</b> of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} water vapor in an {{atmosphere}} is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. <b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice {{on top of a}} mountain. The balance between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure.|$|E
25|$|Water vapor {{will only}} {{condense}} onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{or when the}} water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). The dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.|$|E
50|$|Drought intensifies through {{positive}} feedback. A lack of rain decreases soil moisture, which kills plants and/or {{causes them}} to release less water through transpiration. Both factors limit evapotranspiration, {{the process by which}} water vapor is added to the atmosphere from the surface, and add dry dust to the atmosphere, which absorbs water. Less water vapor means both low <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperatures</b> and more efficient daytime heating, decreasing the chances of humidity in the atmosphere leading to cloud formation. Lastly, without clouds, there cannot be rain, and the loop is complete.|$|R

40|$|When {{natural gas}} is taken from the {{reservoir}} {{it needs to be}} refined by removing liquid and other impurities in order to prevent hydrate formation in the pipelines and to keep the gas within sales specifications. Scrubbers, vertical separators, are used to remove the liquid and the efficiency of the scrubber has a great impact {{on the quality of the}} gas. To control the gas specifications and the efficiency of the scrubber, a <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> meter can be used. This tool will ideally provide the real <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> curve of the gas, which can prevent poor gas quality and damage on the equipment. In this thesis, a manual chilled mirror <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> unit developed by the Bureau of Mines is thermally analysed using the simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> meter is operated by circulating a gas sample past a cold mirror to identify the temperature where condensate forms. The reason for this study is to get a deeper understanding on the thermal and thermodynamic phenomena in the unit and to study the need for modeling mass transfer and compositional gradients. The objective of this thesis is to improve fundamental understanding of the unit, decrease the uncertainties associated with the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> test method and to provide results that can lead to future improvements. A simplified 3 D model of the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> unit has been used for the simulations. The parameters used are based on the experimental test rig at Statoil in Trondheim. Six different cases have been studied, where one or more parameters have been changed for each case to see how the changes affect the temperature in the unit. The simulations confirm that the coldest temperature is in the center of the mirror, and this is where the dew first will appear. The actual temperature at the center of the mirror surface has been found to be between 0. 15 to 1. 62 K higher than the temperature measured by the thermometer, depending on pressure, difference in chamber temperature and the velocity of the gas. Effects of compositional gradients due to thermal diffusion have shown to be present. New <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>temperatures</b> have been calculated based on the new composition at the cold mirror.
