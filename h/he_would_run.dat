5|$|On September 4, 2013, Baker {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> again for Governor of Massachusetts in 2014 when incumbent Governor Deval Patrick, {{to whom he}} lost in 2010, retired. On November 25, 2013, Mark Fisher, a businessman and Tea Party member {{announced that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> against Baker in the Republican primary.|$|E
5|$|Others who {{expressed}} {{their interest in}} running included Texas representatives Bill Flores and Michael McCaul, Georgia representative Lynn Westmoreland, Montana representative Ryan Zinke, and California representative and former Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. However, several candidates made clear that they would only run if Ryan chose not to, including Issa, McCaul, and Minnesota representative John Kline. On October 12, Flores confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Speaker, but stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> only if Ryan {{stayed out of the}} contest.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Arizona Governor on January 9, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run</b> against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but <b>would</b> {{contemplate}} a <b>run</b> if Kohl retired. Ryan later {{stated that}} he was [...] "95 percent sure" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cox {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run</b> for reelection in 2013.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 2009, Gregg reaffirmed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run.</b>|$|R
5|$|In November 2009, Gibbs {{announced}} that, {{rather than}} {{running for re-election}} to the state senate in fall of 2010, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for the Summit County Commissioner seat being vacated by Bob French. Gibbs's retirement opened up a seat that Republicans viewed as a pickup opportunity.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2010, Chico {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> {{for mayor of}} Chicago in 2011. He was one of six candidates on the ballot. Chico raised $4.4million in campaign funds.|$|E
5|$|Following Brown's {{defeat in}} the 2012 U.S Senate race there was wide {{speculation}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> again in 2013 due to John Kerry resigning from the other Massachusetts Senate seat to become Secretary of State. However, on February 1, 2013, he ruled out undertaking a third U.S. Senate campaign {{in less than four}} years.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run</b> for reelection in 2013.|$|R
25|$|In June 2012 he {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run</b> for re-election.|$|R
25|$|On 14 January 2012 ElBaradei {{declared}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>run</b> for president.|$|R
5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she would be like out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E
5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run.</b> Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Sherman {{was active in}} {{politics}} as a perennial candidate. In 2006, he unsuccessfully ran for the 53rd district in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 2008, after meeting Green Party gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, Sherman joined the party. That same year, he ran as a Green for the same seat. He ran unsuccessfully for Buffalo Grove Village Clerk in 2011, for Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2016 as a Green – receiving 4.7% of the vote – and he had announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Illinois's 12th congressional district in 2018. He served as the Cook County Green Party chairman in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2012, Booker {{announced}} that he would explore running for the U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run.</b> Roughly one month after declaring his interest in running for the Senate, incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E

5|$|Since {{retiring}} as a player, Barkley has had {{a successful}} career as a television NBA analyst. He works with Turner Network Television (TNT) alongside of Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games and is a spokesman for CDW. In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, he announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Governor of Alabama in 2014, but {{he changed his mind}} in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Governor of Ohio, {{prompted by}} {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|E
5|$|On a {{cold day}} the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting {{as well as}} his mother's {{resulting}} protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.|$|E

5|$|The filing {{deadline}} {{to appear on}} the Democratic primary ballot was March 12, 2013, at 5:00 PM EDT. At this point, seven candidates had formally filed petitions to run for Mayor of Pittsburgh: Jim Ferlo, Darlene Harris, Michael Lamb, Bill Peduto, A. J. Richardson, Jake Wheatley and Jack Wagner. Allegheny County Councilman Bill Robinson stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Mayor despite not meeting the deadline for petitions {{to appear on the}} ballot. Jim Ferlo, despite filing to run, dropped out of the race three days later, on March 15. On March 27, Darlene Harris dropped out of the race. On the same day, Jack Wagner received endorsements from Pittsburgh police and firefighter unions, as well as former candidate and State Senator Jim Ferlo. Also on March 27, Bill Peduto was endorsed by State Representative Ed Gainey.|$|E
5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> {{for election}} to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much {{of the campaign}} revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time began thinking about running for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he {{explained}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>run</b> for Speaker if he could be guaranteed {{an overwhelming majority of}} the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E
