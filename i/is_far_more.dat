5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece.

5|$|Thallium {{tends to}} oxidize to the +3 and +1 {{oxidation}} states as ionic salts. The +3 state {{resembles that of}} the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, which <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fast Fourier {{transform}} (FFT) -based computations can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> {{accurate than}} the slow transforms suggest. Discrete Fourier transforms computed through the FFT <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accurate than slow transforms, and convolutions computed via FFT <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accurate than the direct results. However, these results depend critically on {{the accuracy of}} the FFT software employed, which should generally be considered suspect. Popular recursions for fast computation of the sine/cosine table (or twiddle factors) are inaccurate due to inherent instability. Some analyses of these recursions that have appeared heretofore in print, suggesting stability, are incorrect. Even in higher dimensions, the FFT is remarkably stable...|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> than in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often {{be the result of}} an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> common.|$|E

5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E
5|$|Red maple <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> {{abundant}} {{today than}} when Europeans {{first arrived in}} North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur.
