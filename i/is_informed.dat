40|$|We {{examined}} {{the degree to}} which newly diagnosed patients with advanced lung cancer wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> and involved in medical decision-making, and whether the patients felt their preferences were met. Patients from 13 hospitals in Flanders were interviewed with a standard questionnaire. A total of 128 patients (68 %) participated. Of the patients who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about life expectancy, half (53 %) reported they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> and of those who wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about palliative care and end-of-life decisions, 25 % and 31 % said they <b>were</b> <b>informed,</b> respectively. With regard to participation in medical decision-making (in general, about treatment, transfer or end-of-life), patients who preferred the doctor to make decisions or those who preferred to make the decision themselves often achieved this (in their perception), while patients who wanted an in-between position with some involvement, often did not. To conclude, preferences of patients with lung cancer for information concerning delicate topics and for shared decision-making with the physician were not well met...|$|R
