40|$|The Norwegian Seafood Federation (FHL) {{has applied}} for {{approval}} of a new alternative method for processing of category 2 animal by-products (ABP) of fish origin. The processing method is characterized by fish raw material that is grinded before mixing with formic acid at pH ≤ 4 and stored for ≥ 24 hours before heat treatment of the silage with a particle size ≤ 10 mm at a temperature ≥ 85 °C for ≥ 25 minutes. The method was assessed by EFSA (BIOHAZ-panel) who concluded that the risk related to pathogens present in fish ABP’s from aquaculture would be adequately reduced by the proposed process if {{the requirements of the}} HACCP-plan could be achieved in a full scale plant. The production trials verified the feasibility of the HACCP-plan under real processing conditions in a full scale plant. Another purpose of the production trials was to demonstrate that relevant pathogens are inactivated by the proposed process. For each of 20 batches produced, 5 samples of silage and 5 of end product were analyzed for Salmonella and Enterobacteriaceae. All results were negative, confirming earlier lab scale experiments showing that the formic acid treatment alone inactivate those bacteria. One composite sample of silage and one of end product for each batch were analyzed for C. perfringens. All results were negative, confirming a low prevalence of C. perfringens in <b>fish</b> <b>silages,</b> as also demonstrated in earlier surveys. Anaerobic sulfite-reducing bacteria were analyzed in the same composite samples. The concentration in silage ranged from 1. 100 to 130. 000 per gram, while heat treatment provided on average more than 3 log reductions. This reduction rate is comparable to that found in earlier lab scale inactivation experiments with C. perfringens and C. sporogenes spores. All batches of end product met the microbiological requirements used to assess inactivation effect of new processing methods according to method 7 in Regulation (EC) 1774 / 2002.

Increasing the level of either feeding or fish meal increased rates of empty body weight gain linearly (P 0 ? 01). Consequently, in terms of whole body composition, animals given fish meal were leaner than animals offered silage alone. Fish-meal supplementation had no significant effect on the composition of the carcass but increased the concentration of protein in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. The increase in nitrogen intake associated with feeding fish meal resulted in a reduction in the efficiency of nitrogen utilization as level of fish meal increased. Nitrogen intake required for maintenance was estimated to be 1 ? 054 g/kg LW 0 ? 75. In spite of marked differences in the composition of the empty body-weight gain, there was no evidence to support an effect of fish meal on the efficiency of metabolizable energy (ME) utilization for growth (kf) which was estimated to be 0 ? 346 on the basis of data scaled by LW 0 ? 75.

The middle intestine of Oreochromis niloticus showed differences in the neutral mucus glicoproteic, acid glicoproteic and glicoconjugated secretion pattern, depending on the protein origin and the percentage used in the diet, demonstrating that this species can adapt its secretion system {{for the protection of the}} digesting apparatus during the absorption of different protein sources...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to produce <b>fish</b> <b>silage</b> by lactic acid {{fermentation}} and evaluate its use in feeding of quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica). An oven-dried mixture of <b>fish</b> <b>silage</b> and soybean meal (1 : 1 w/w) was used to prepare the diets with different levels of inclusion (0, 10, 20 and 30 %) and evaluate its effect on the performance and meat quality of 160 quails. The inclusion level did not affect the growth and feed conversion ratio. The carcass yield (70. 3 %) and sensory quality of breast meat were not significantly different among the treatments (p> 0. 05). However, the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic (C 18 : 1 n 9 C), linoleic (C 18 : 2 n 6 C), linolenic (C 18 : 3 n 3), arachidonic (C 20 : 4 n 6), cis eicosapentaenoic (C 20 : 5 n 3) and cis docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n 3) increased in quail breast meat with the inclusion of fish silage:soybean mixture in the diet (p< 0. 05). <b>Fish</b> <b>silage</b> and its use in quail diets could offer a good alternative for fish waste utilization as feedstuff component for the improvement of fatty acid composition in its breast meat...|$|E
30|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>silage</b> {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} protein source in the formulation of rations for monogastrics. However, due to lipid oxidation that can compromise the nutritional value of the ration, removal of the lipid fraction is required. This additional step can be avoided since the cultures were also found to possess good antioxidant properties, thereby protecting the lipid layer from auto-oxidation. Lipid oxidation can provoke the formation of peroxides, which form physical and covalent bonds from proteins. Covalent bonds between oxidised products and proteins can destroy amino acids, such as tryptophan, oxidise methionine and bind lysine to other compounds, making these amino acids unavailable. Hence, through the usage of these cultures, there is no requirement for the additional inclusion of antioxidants in the preparation of <b>fish</b> <b>silage.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY – In {{order to}} reduce {{reliance}} on fishmeal in fish feed formulations, several alternative protein sources or supplements were tested in Egypt. Feeding trials on Nile and blue tilapias, Oreochromis niloticus and O. aureus, gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax, and mullet, Mugil cephalus, were conducted. The main target was the efficient utilization of waste animal and plant resources, such as trash fish and macroalgae, for fish feed production. Acid and fermented <b>fish</b> <b>silage,</b> a mixture of <b>fish</b> <b>silage</b> and soybean meal, green and red macroalgae Ulva and Pterocladia meals were all investigated.

CT supplementation on protein trash <b>fish</b> <b>silage</b> was on control proportion (0), under optimum level (2. 0 %), at optimum level (4. 0 %), and above optimum level (6. 0 %) of g TFS); of protein precipitation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with CT from L. leucocephala; and under optimum level (1. 5 %), at optimum level (3. 0 %) and above optimum level (4. 5 % of g TFS), BSA protein precipitation with CT from C. calothyrsus. The effect on degradation in ruminal fluid and ruminal fluid followed by incubation in HCl-pepsin was evaluated using a modified two-step in vitro method. The CT level of L. leucocephala and C. calothyrsus was 4 % and 6 %, respectively with protein precipitation BSA was 26. 25 and 31. 77 g BSA/g CT, respectively. CT supplementation to trash <b>fish</b> <b>silage,</b> ruminal fermentation product (NH 3 -N, C 2, C 3, and total VFAs) and digestibility (DM and OM) decreased (P< 0. 01) and increased (P< 0. 01) total CP digestibility (in HCl-pepsin). The difference was attributed to CT source without affecting ruminal microbial protein synthesis. CT of L. leucocephala was better in increasing total protein digestibility (70 %) than that of C. calothyrsus  (15 %).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the nutritional value of four protein sources (soyabean meal, <b>fish</b> <b>silage,</b> sardine fish and fishmeal) using commercial broiler and local poultry strains. Four experimental diets were formulated; representing four different proteins sources and was evaluated using six replicates of eight birds per cage at 21 day of age. Cages were located in an environmentally controlled room maintained under conditions suitable for birds at this age with a photo-period of 23 h in every 24 h. Diets and water were offered on ad libitum basis. On the fourth day after the adaptation to the experimental diets, feed troughs were removed from every cage for 1 h and then reintroduced for 2 h. Then the birds were killed to allow for sampling of ileal digesta, from Meckels diverticulum to the ileal-caecal-colonic injunction. Broiler birds showed significantly (p< 0. 001) higher digestibility coefficients and digestible content of amino acids across all the protein sources than the local birds. Out of the four protein sources evaluated in this study, fishmeal had the lowest amino acids digestibility coefficient for the two bird breeds (p< 0. 001). The digestibility coefficient and digestible content of amino acids estimates for <b>fish</b> <b>silage</b> was the highest across the two strains (p< 0. 001). The lower digestibility of amino acids for soyabean meal is related to the presence of; antinutritional factor, trypsin inhibitor. <b>Fish</b> <b>silage</b> shows a great potential to be used as protein supplements for poultry feeding. The results suggest that the class of chickens and protein source significantly influenced the apparent ileal digestibility and digestible contents of amino acids in the nutrient assessed in this study...|$|E
