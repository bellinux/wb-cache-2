The latter was extended to Bodø Airport and Tromsø Airport from 1 April 1967, and upgraded to a fourth daily service. Some Oslo services were provided using a Douglas DC-6.

25|$|In July 1987, a {{distance}} measurement in the <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> equipment failed, terminating all scheduled and night flights {{until it was}} replaced in September.

The latter allowed the airport status as an international airport, which allowed charter flights to Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom, which were often done on a weekly basis by foreign companies involved in the heavy industry. However, the airport did not have status as a permanent border control and the airport therefore had to cover these costs themselves. The Ministry of Justice stated that the airport was too close to Flesland, Haugesund and Sola to have permanent status, but allowed the chief-of-police to give dispensations for individual flights from 1988.

There exist some theoretical results that asymptotically guarantee the classification accuracy of k-nearest neighbor when the sample size grows larger. These results hold true under the assumption that the <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> is a metric. The results still hold for pseudometrics up to some technicality. Whether the results are valid for the non-subadditive <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> is still left unanswered. Pseudometric is also practically appealing. Once we have a subadditive <b>distance</b> <b>measure,</b> the measure will have at least one significant advantage over the non-subadditive; one can directly plug such <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> into systems which exploit the subadditivity to perform faster nearest neighbor search techniques.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a further {{generalization}} of differential evolution based data classification method is proposed, demonstrated and initially evaluated. The differential evolution classifier is a nearest prototype vector based classifier that applies a global optimization algorithm, differential evolution, {{for determining the}} optimal values for all free parameters of the classifier model during the training phase of the classifier. The earlier version of differential evolution classifier that applied individually optimized <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> for each new data set to be classified is generalized here so, that instead of optimizing a single <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> for the given data set, we take a further step by proposing an approach where <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> are optimized individually for each feature of the data set to be classified. In particular, <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> for each feature are selected optimally from a predefined pool of alternative <b>distance</b> <b>measures.</b> The optimal <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> are determined by differential evolution algorithm, which is also determining the optimal values for all free parameters of the selected <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> in parallel. After determining the optimal <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> for each feature together with their optimal parameters, we combine all featurewisely determined <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> to form a single total <b>distance</b> <b>measure,</b> {{that is to be}} applied for the final classification decisions. The actual classification process is still based on the nearest prototype vector principle; A sample belongs to the class represented by the nearest prototype vector when measured with the above referred optimized total <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> During the training process the differential evolution algorithm determines optimally the class vectors, selects optimal distance metrics for each data feature, and determines the optimal values for the free parameters of each selected <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> Based on experimental results with nine well known classification benchmark data sets, the proposed approach yield a statistically significant improvement to the classification accuracy of differential evolution classifier.
