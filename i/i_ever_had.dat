The first PBR <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
500|$|After his death, McGinnity was eulogized as [...] "hard player" [...] and [...] "a fighter with brains" [...] {{who hated}} to lose. Jennings {{described}} him as an even better fielder than he was a pitcher. McGraw said that McGinnity was [...] "the hardest working pitcher <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> on my ballcub". Connie Mack called him a [...] "magician".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, former President Clinton {{referred}} to Hsu as [...] "our friend Norman". After the scandal went public, Bill Clinton remarked in colloquial language, [...] "You could have knocked me {{over with a}} straw". Democrats are continuing to try to reconcile positive personal impressions of Hsu with his criminal behavior. Mark Gorenberg, who sat on President Barack Obama campaign's national finance committee, remarked, [...] "Despite it all, I still love the guy, despite everything you read, every experience <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> with him was nothing but delightful, and I just scratch my head." ...|$|E

500|$|Harvey {{is also an}} {{accomplished}} sculptor who has had several pieces exhibited at the Lamont Gallery and the Bridport Arts Centre. In 2010, she was invited to be the guest designer for the summer issue of Francis Ford Coppola's literary magazine [...] The issue featured Harvey's paintings and drawings alongside short stories by Woody Allen. Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011, Harvey said: [...] "the first opportunity <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to show any work was in this magazine. They were drawn while I was writing and recording the record (Let England Shake). It does relate to the record {{in the way the}} cycle keeps happening." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing {{look on her face}} was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E
500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 {{is because he}} took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E

[...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, {{and that was really}} amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in the experience of a show." [...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|Baker {{was finally}} {{sent to the}} front in April and {{assigned}} to the 103d Aero Squadron, formed from {{former members of the}} Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps in January 1918. [...] Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane {{for the first time in}} his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given credit for it. In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the [...] "biggest thrill <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in my life", and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E

500|$|Hershey {{once said}} that {{starring}} in Boxcar Bertha (1972) [...] "was the most fun <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> on a movie." [...] The film, co-starring Hershey's domestic partner, David Carradine, and produced by Roger Corman, was Martin Scorsese's first Hollywood picture. Shot in six weeks on a budget of $600,000, Boxcar Bertha {{was intended to be}} a period crime drama similar to Corman's Bloody Mama (1970) or Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Although Corman publicized it as an exploitation piece with plenty of sex and violence, Scorsese's influence made it [...] "something much more." [...] Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote of the film's direction, [...] "Martin Scorsese has gone for mood and atmosphere more than for action, and his violence is always blunt and unpleasantnever liberating and exhilarating, as the New Violence is supposed to be." [...] A spread recreating sexually explicit scenes from the movie appeared in Playboy magazine in 1972.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, {{with little}} {{work to be}} found in the comic book field due to a {{downturn}} in the industry, he went to work as an assistant to John Prentice on the Alex Raymond-created comic strip Rip Kirby for a three-year period. According to Williamson: [...] "The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac , John's prior assistant, didn't want to go... The deal was: would I be willing to go to Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..." [...] It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: [...] "...he was terrific. He's the best guy <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> by far." [...] During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise.|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E

Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game I look back on more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> playing football." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Brown, {{the coach}} of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E
500|$|A {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} of the Dino De Laurentiis' film, Flash Gordon, written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Al Williamson, was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats {{to coincide with the}} film's release. A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones, who played Flash Gordon, was pasted into the original cover art. It was serialized in three issues of Whitman's Flash Gordon comic book, #31–33, March–May 1981. Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages. [...] According to Williamson, [...] "It was the hardest job <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to do in my life." [...] He then began drawing the Star Wars comic strip in February 1981 following Alfredo Alcala's tenure, with Goodwin writing. [...] He drew the daily and Sunday feature until March 11, 1984, when the strip was canceled. [...] Williamson's daily strips on this series were completely reprinted in Russ Cochran's three-volume slipcase edition in 1991.|$|E

500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it.

Vedder said that [...] "Gone" [...] is about a man [...] "needing to find a new life without his past, without his possessions, and not really looking for more possessions." [...] Damien Echols, one of the three members of the West Memphis 3, co-wrote the lyrics to [...] "Army Reserve". For the first time McCready contributed lyrics to a Pearl Jam album, writing the lyrics to the closing track [...] "Inside Job". McCready said that he wrote the lyrics while touring in São Paulo as he [...] "want this song to happen" [...] despite Vedder not having done the lyrics yet, and added that the lyrical inspiration was the realization that [...] "I had to go inside myself first before I could be open to outside ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April7, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. [...] " [...] it's a funny bunch of people", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV..." [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. [...] "You can't do anything {{for the first time at}} this point", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". [...] "I gotta say, this was the most fun <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> working on an episode", he said in the episode's DVD commentary.
