500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the <b>gala</b> <b>dinner</b> scenes in Episode 6.

The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E
