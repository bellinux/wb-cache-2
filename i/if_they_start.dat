There is no strict time limit, but Rome will run a caller <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> rambling too long. The winning criteria is subjective, as there are no set rules or criteria. However, the winning call is typically the person who comes up with some original smack for the other top callers, mixes in some sports takes, and brings something new to the event.|$|E

And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E

2500|$|Televangelist Pat Robertson {{weighed in}} during August 2010, telling his TV audience, [...] "You mark my word, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> {{bringing}} {{thousands and thousands}} of Muslims into that relatively rural area {{the next thing you know}} they're going to be taking over the city council." [...] Murfreesboro's mayor, Ernest Burgess, called Robertson's claims [...] "so ridiculous they do not deserve a response." [...] Opposition was also fanned by a local newspaper, the ultra-conservative Rutherford Reader, which published numerous anti-Islamic articles. After protests from readers over these, some of its advertisers boycotted the newspaper. As the barrage of criticism from right-wingers continued, the ICM received a series of threatening and offensive anonymous telephone messages.|$|E
2500|$|One {{comment that}} drew {{criticism}} from the blogosphere, as well as fellow conservatives, was made during {{a speech at the}} Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2006, where she said, referring to the prospect of a nuclear-equipped Iran, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> having one of these bipolar episodes with nuclear weapons? I think our motto should be, post-9-11: Raghead talks tough, raghead faces consequences." [...] Coulter had previously written a nearly identical passage in her syndicated column: [...] "... I believe our motto should be, after 9/11: Jihad monkey talks tough; jihad monkey takes the consequences. Sorry, I realize that's offensive. How about 'camel jockey'? What? Now what'd I say? Boy, you tent merchants sure are touchy. Grow up, would you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Of his {{direction}} of the film, Bakshi stated, [...] "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's {{not the type of}} picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> walking down the street singing." [...] Bakshi wanted the film to be the antithesis of any animated film produced by the Walt Disney Company. Accordingly, Fritz the Cat includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Donald Duck are shown cheering on the United States Air Force as it drops napalm on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the [...] "Pink Elephants on Parade" [...] sequence from Dumbo. A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in Hey Good Lookin'.|$|E

2500|$|Full-backs usually {{position}} themselves several metres behind the back line. They field any deep opposition kicks {{and are often}} {{the last line of}} defence should an opponent break through the back line. On attack, they can enter the back line, usually near the centres or wings, with the aim of providing an extra person and overlapping the defending players. Three of the most important attributes of a good full-back are good catching ability under a high kick, the ability to punt the ball a long distance with accuracy and the speed and skill to join in back line attacking moves, especially counter-attacks. The full-back is the player most likely to field the high ball or [...] "up and unders" [...] kicked by the opposition. Good hands are needed to ensure the ball is caught cleanly to deny the opposition the chance to regain possession. As the full-back will inevitably catch the ball deep in their own territory with little support from their own players, they should either kick the ball downfield or run forward to link up with their backs to start a counter-attack. If the full-back kicks the ball out, the opposition have the line-out whereas <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>start</b> a counter-attack they have a number of options.|$|E

I will go over to Michael Cross, and engage him to come behind on his swift nag, and keep a bright lookout on the road, and warn us if any company of men come on. Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses; and he could shoot ahead and let us know, if there were any danger. I am going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and to see about the horse. We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us.
