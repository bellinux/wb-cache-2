According to the estimate of the weight of the mixed gas before adopted (791.), this volume is equal to 2.3535544 grains, which therefore is the weight of water decomposed; and this quantity is to 8.45, the quantity of zinc oxidized, as 9 is to 32.31. Now taking 9 as the equivalent number of water, the number 32.5 is given as the equivalent number of zinc; a coincidence sufficiently near to show, what indeed could not but happen, that for an equivalent of zinc oxidized an equivalent of water must be decomposed[A].|$|E
50|$|Crease {{formation}} in woven or knitted fabric composed of cellulose during washing or folding {{is the main}} drawback of cotton fabrics. The molecular chains of the cotton fibers are attached with each other by weak hydrogen bonds. During washing or folding, the hydrogen bonds break easily and after <b>drying</b> new <b>hydrogen</b> bonds form with the chains in their new position and the creases are stabilized. If crosslinking between the polymer chains can be introduced by crosslinking chemicals, then it reinforces the cotton fibers and prevents the permanent displacement of the polymer chains when the fibers are stressed.

We discuss the most appropriate constitutive models for their simulation and choose the cohesive fracture model for quasi-brittle materials. Successively we show governing equations for a thermo-hydro-mechanical problem, which is representative for multifield problems. Possible extensions to more fields are addressed. Then methods for numerical modeling of multifield fracturing are presented and the most representative ones, i. e., interface and embedded discontinuity elements, X-FEM, thick level set and phase field models, and discrete crack approach with adaptive remeshing are discussed in some detail. After incorporating this last method in the governing equations, their numerical solution is shown together with the necessary adaptivity in time and space. This solution is validated. Successively applications to thermomechanical fracture; hydraulic fracturing {{in case of a}} pumped well and of 2 D and 3 D dams; fracturing of drying concrete and of a massive concrete beam and finally mechanical effects of chemical processes in concrete are shown. In the case of the pumped well with constant pumping rate, a comparison between an Extended Finite Element solution and that of the discrete crack approach with adaptive remeshing is made which allows for interesting considerations about the nature of hydraulic fracturing. The examples permit to conclude that with increasing complexity of the multifield problems that of the employed fracture models decreases, i. e., advanced fracture models have to date only been applied to problems with a limited number of fields, mainly displacement, thermal and/or pressure fields.

The dry polyimide has good adhesion to silicon substrate but not to the dry FOx- 16, so we can separate the polyimide from the dry FOx- 16 and get the air gap.
