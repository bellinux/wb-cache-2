Such a <b>helical</b> <b>field</b> can be generated by adding a toroidal field (traveling around the torus in circles) and a poloidal field (traveling in circles orthogonal to the toroidal field).

These lines of force quickly reconnect into a low arcade of loops leaving a helix of magnetic field unconnected {{to the rest of the}} arcade. The sudden release of energy in this reconnection is the origin of the particle acceleration. The unconnected magnetic <b>helical</b> <b>field</b> and the material that it contains may violently expand outwards forming a coronal mass ejection.

5000|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} the Soviets had been quietly {{developing}} the tokamak device. In configuration, the tokamak is largely {{identical to the}} z-pinch devices like ZETA, consisting of a ring of magnets surrounding a toroidal vacuum tube, with a large transformer used to induce current into the plasma. The magnetic field of the two sources mixed to produce a single <b>helical</b> <b>field</b> that winds around the plasma. Where the two systems differed was primarily in {{the ratio of the}} power of the fields; ZETA's field was generated almost entirely by the transformer current, while the tokamak used more powerful ring magnets to balance the two more closely.

5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{was a way}} to modify the torus layout so that it {{addressed}} Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the drift caused by the magnet windings being too close together {{on one side of the}} device would be counteracted by them being too far apart on the other. The particles would alternately drift one way and then the other. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross-sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ...

We investigate the Faraday screen properties and its location with respect to the jet emitting region. Given that the 43 GHz radio core flux density and the RM time evolution suggest a similar trend, we explore the possible connection between the RM and the accretion rate. Among the various scenarios that we explore, the jet sheath is the most promising candidate for being the main source of Faraday rotation. During the one-year observing period the RM trend shows two sign reversals, which may be qualitatively interpreted {{within the context of the}} magnetic tower models. We invoke the presence of two nested helical magnetic fields in the relativistic jet with opposite helicities, whose relative contribution produce the observed RM values. The inner <b>helical</b> <b>field</b> has the poloidal component (B_ p) oriented in the observer's direction and produces a positive RM, while the outer <b>helical</b> <b>field,</b> with B_ p in the opposite direction, produces a negative RM.

We report the detection of 15 -GHz parsec-scale CP in two more AGN (3 C 345 and 2231 + 114), and confirm the MOJAVE detection of CP in 1633 + 382. It is generally believed that the most likely mechanism for the generation of this CP is Faraday conversion of linear polarization to CP. A helical jet magnetic-field (B-field) geometry can facilitate this process - linearly polarized emission from {{the far side of}} the jet is converted to CP as it passes through the magnetised plasma at the front side of the jet on its way toward the observer. In this case, the sign of the generated CP is essentially determined by the pitch angle and helicity of the <b>helical</b> B <b>field.</b> We have determined the pitch-angle regimes and helicities of the <b>helical</b> jet B <b>fields</b> in 8 AGN for which parsec-scale CP has been detected, and used them to predict the expected CP signs for these AGN if the CP is generated via conversion in these <b>helical</b> <b>fields.</b> We have obtained the intriguing result that our predictions agree with the observed signs in all eight cases, provided that the longitudinal B-field components in the jets correspond to South magnetic poles.
