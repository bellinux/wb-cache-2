40|$|Long range {{movement}} of the iron-sulfur protein (ISP) between the cytochrome b (cyt b) and cyt c 1 redox centers {{plays a key role}} in electron transfer within the cyt bc 1 complex. A series of 21 mutants in the cyt b ef loop of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cyt bc 1 were prepared to examine the role of this loop in controlling the capture and release of the ISP from cyt b. Electron transfer in the cyt bc 1 complex was studied using a ruthenium dimer to rapidly photooxidize cyt c 1 within 1 μs and initiate the reaction. The rate constant for electron transfer from the iron-sulfur center [2 Fe 2 S] center to cyt c 1 was k 1 = 60, 000 s− 1. <b>Famoxadone</b> binding to the Qo site decreases k 1 to 5, 400 s− 1, indicating that a conformational change on the surface of cyt b decreases the rate of release of the ISP from cyt b.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modified}} Q cycle mechanism {{accounts for}} the proton and charge translocation stoichiometry of the bc 1 complex, and is now widely accepted. However the mechanism by which the requisite bifurcation of electron flow at the Qo site reaction is enforced is not clear. One of several proposals involves conformational gating of the docking of the Rieske ISP at the Qo site, controlled by {{the stage of the}} reaction cycle. Effects of different Qo-site inhibitors on the position of the ISP seen in crystals may reflect the same conformational mechanism, in which case understanding how different inhibitors control the position of the ISP may be a key to understanding the enforcement of bifurcation at the Qo site (Table  1). Here we examine the available structures of cytochrome bc 1 with different Qo-site inhibitors and different ISP positions to look for clues to this mechanism. The effect of ISP removal on binding affinity of the inhibitors stigmatellin and <b>famoxadone</b> suggest a “mutual stabilization” of inhibitor binding and ISP docking, however this thermodynamic observation sheds little light on the mechanism. The cd 1 helix of cytochrome b moves {{in such a way as}} to accommodate docking when inhibitors favoring docking are bound, but it is impossible with the current structures to say whether this movement of α-cd 1 is a cause or result of ISP docking. One component of the movement of the linker between E and F helices also correlates with the type of inhibitor and ISP position, and seems to be related to the H-bonding pattern of Y 279 of cytochrome b. An H-bond from Y 279 to the ISP, and its possible modulation by movement of F 275 in the presence of <b>famoxadone</b> and related inhibitors, or its competition with an alternate H-bond to I 269 of cytochrome b that may be destabilized by bound <b>famoxadone,</b> suggest other possible mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract: Flowers are {{frequently}} treated with pesticides and, as a result, florists handling daily {{a large number}} of flowers can be exposed to pesticide residues. A study was conducted among twenty volunteer florists located in Namur Province and in the Brussels Capital Region of Belgium in order to assess their potential dermal exposure to dislodgeable pesticide residues transferred from flowers to hands. Two pairs of cotton gloves were worn during two consecutive half days while handling flowers and preparing bouquets (from min 2 h to max 3 h/day). The residual pesticide deposits on the glove samples were extracted with a multi-residue Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed by a combination of gas and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) by an accredited laboratory. A total of 111 active substances (mainly insecticides and fungicides) were detected, with an average of 37 active substances per sample and a total concentration per glove sample of 22. 22 mg/kg. Several predictive levels of contamination were considered to assess the risk. The potential dermal exposures (PDE) of florists were estimated at the average, for different percentiles, and at the maximum concentration of residues in samples. At the PDE P 90 and at the PDEMAX (or worst case) values, three and five active substances respectively exceed the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL), indicating risk situations. For the systemic exposure (SE), one active substance (clofentezine) exceeds the AOEL at the P 90 predictive level. In the worst case, SEMAX (at the maximum concentrations), four active substances (clofentezine, <b>famoxadone,</b> methiocarb, and pyridaben) exceed their respective AOEL values. Among the 14 most frequently detected active substances, two have SEMAX values exceeding the AOEL. Exposure could be particularly critical for clofentezine with an SEMAX value four times higher than the AOEL (393 %). The exposure of florists appeared to be an example of a unique professional situation in which workers are exposed regularly to both a very high number of toxic chemicals and rather high concentration levels. Therefore the priority should be to raise the level of awareness among the florists who must change their habits and practices if they want to minimize their exposure. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Analysis of surangin B 2 ̆ 7 s inhibition of complex I 1 used submitochondrial particles. Surangin B displayed noncompetitive kinetics when either succinate or decylubiquinone were used as substrates. indicating that it binds to a site which is distinct from both the succinate binding site and the domain responsible for interacting with ubiquinone. Difference spectra of reduced complex I 11 equilibrated with surangin B closely parallelled those of antimycin A, but were very different {{to those of the}} selective Q, site inhibitors myxothiazol and <b>famoxadone.</b> Other experiments used the electron acceptor 2 -nitrosofluorene, which intercepts electrons specifically from the Qi site. These experiments confirmed that like antimycin A, surangin B selectively blocks electron diversion to 2 -nitrosofluorene through Qi within complex 111. Surangin B causes presynaptic release of both neurotransmitter and nonneurotransmitter amino acids from mouse brain synaptosomes. The stimulatory effect of surangin B and other complex 111 -specific inhibitors on amino acid release was inhibited by N,N,N 1,N 2 ̆ 7 -tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine suggesting that complex I 11 blockade in mitochondria of the nerve ending is an important mechanism causing release. Surangin B also inhibited in vitro mycelial growth and spore germination in several species of fungi. As an inhibitor of mycelial growth surangin B showed strongest activity against Rhizoctonia solani (ICSo = 3. 8 pM) and Botrytis cinerea (IC 50 = 11. 2 pM), but inhibitory effects were less pronounced in Alternaria dauci, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium sp. (IC 50 s > 30 pM) and absent in Trichoderma harzianum. Surangin B reduced the level of spore germination in Fusarium oxysporum (IC 5 o = 2. 3 pM) and Botrytis cinerea (IC 50 = 1. 4 pM), although Alternaria dauci was considerably more tolerant of this coumarin (IC 5 o = 500 pM). The activity of surangin B compared favorably with certain commercial fungicides indicating that coumarins of this type may have potential as an antifungal agents...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, <b>famoxadone</b> fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
