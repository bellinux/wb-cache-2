5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal <b>interphalangeal</b> joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal <b>interphalangeal</b> joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|In smaller joints, {{such as at}} the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called Heberden's nodes (on {{the distal}} <b>interphalangeal</b> joints) or Bouchard's nodes (on the {{proximal}} <b>interphalangeal</b> joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit {{the movement of the}} fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of bunions, rendering them red or swollen.|$|E
25|$|It {{presents}} with monoarthritis {{affecting the}} large joints {{such as the}} knees and sacroiliac spine causing pain and swelling. An asymmetrical inflammatory arthritis of <b>interphalangeal</b> joints may be present but with relative sparing of small joints such as the wrist and hand.|$|E
25|$|The large, fleshy phalangeal foot pads, {{the small}} <b>interphalangeal</b> foot pads, the {{presence}} of only reticulate scales {{on the underside of}} the foot (which increases flexibility), and curved foot claws of Confuciusornis are all traits shared with modern tree-dwelling, perching birds, suggesting that Confuciusornis itself may have had a similar lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} nodal osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, {{also called}} inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA {{is a much}} less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal <b>interphalangeal</b> joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on x-ray.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeleton}} of the thumb {{consists of the}} first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with the carpus at the carpometacarpal joint and distally with the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This latter bone articulates with the distal phalanx at the <b>interphalangeal</b> joint. Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones at the metacarpophalangeal joint.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{fluorescence}} of two Confuciusornis specimens revealed {{additional details}} of their soft-tissue anatomy. The propatagium of Confuciusornis was large, likely relatively thick, and extended from the shoulder to the wrist, as in modern birds; {{the extent of the}} postpatagium is also similar to modern birds. Reticulate scales covered the underside of the foot, and the phalanges and metatarsals supported large, fleshy pads, although the <b>interphalangeal</b> pads were either small or entirely absent.|$|E
25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the <b>interphalangeal</b> articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E

After Kenshin defeats him and breaks his zanbatō, Sanosuke decides to focus on unarmed combat. When the criminal Shishio Makoto tries to conquer Japan, Sanosuke helps Kenshin {{in the fight against}} him. While on his trip to Kyoto to aid him, Sanosuke was trained in kenpo from a warrior monk named Yūkyūzan Anji. Anji taught Sanosuke a secret technique called [...] Futae no Kiwami is a special art in which the user performs two hits in quick succession with any part of his body. The first hit with the proximal <b>interphalangeal</b> joint neutralizes the hardness of the target, then the second blow, struck with the proximal phalanx, breaks the target before it recovers from the force of the first blow. Using his mastery from this art with the his right hand allows him to defeat the third most powerful opponent in Shishio's army: Anji.|$|E
