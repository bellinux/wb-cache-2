5|$|Crime author Ann Rule {{covered the}} case in her book Bitter Harvest: A Woman's Fury, a Mother's Sacrifice, which {{provided}} extensive detail on both the case's development and Green's personal biography. The book was a New York Times Bestseller, though one reviewer felt that Rule failed to address Green's motivation for her crimes and that she <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> Green unsympathetically and Farrar over-sympathetically.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the fury {{of one of his}} former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E
5|$|For a time, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was {{the only}} Australian {{presence}} on the Western Front, but in April 1916, Australian Army units began arriving from the Middle East in large numbers. The Australian Voluntary Hospital's site in Wimereux {{was taken over by}} No. 3 Australian General Hospital, AIF in June 1916. The Australian Voluntary Hospital was then absorbed into the British Army as No. 32 Stationary Hospital, with Eames remaining in command. By 1 May 1919, the hospital <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> 73,868 patients.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign.

5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation for the way he <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E

In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> June. Ferguson said she was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis was a mistake and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E

Harrison later apologised for {{the way that he}} and Lennon <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of Transcendental Meditation to at-risk students.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{domestic}} {{peace was}} shattered when Hogg's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, {{the son of}} Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union. Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> Percy Shelley years earlier, but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a single}} fatality, 31-year-old Mosotho man Leshomo Makhaola, who died when a wall of an old mining house {{collapsed}} on him in Kanana, North West. An ER24 spokesperson said that miners had reportedly been trapped in 11 mine shafts at a mine in Orkney; however, subsequent inspections revealed that the miners at that location were safe. All 3,300 AngloGold Ashanti miners underground at its Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines near Orkney {{had been brought to}} the surface by 19:30 SAST on 5August, including 34 who had been injured. All 34 miners were treated for minor injuries, including lacerations, contusions and a broken leg, and discharged from hospital on 6August. AngloGold Ashanti management had proceeded with the evacuation after their temporarily interrupted power supply was mostly restored, mine management had contacted the mine crew underground by telephone and mine engineers had ensured that the shaft infrastructure was in working order. AngloGold Ashanti emergency medical staff <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> injured miners, and counsellors <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> some employees for shock. Mining operations at their Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines were subsequently suspended pending safety checks.|$|E

Seventy-eight out of 95 (82 %) participants considered {{having to deal with}} infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria {{in the intensive care unit}} where they work was a major or significant problem. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and third-generation cephalosporinresistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently reported antibiotic-resistant bacteria with 69 (73 %) and 67 (71 %) participants reporting <b>having</b> <b>treated</b> at least one patient with such an infection during the preceding six months, respectively. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae, were more frequently reported than any selected antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, with the exception of MRSA. Fifty (53 %) participants declared <b>having</b> <b>treated</b> at least one patient infected with a bacterium totally or almost totally resistant to available antibiotics during the past six months, with 8 participants <b>having</b> <b>treated</b> more than 10 such patients and 13 <b>having</b> <b>treated</b> from 3 to 10 such patients...|$|R

5|$|After a stay of six weeks, Hogg had {{to return}} to the conveyancer's office in York, and the Shelleys decided to {{accompany}} him back to his home in that city. In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle. Harriet remained with Hogg, who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her. Harriet's mother soon learned that Hogg and her daughter were living together, and sent Harriet's sister to stay with them. Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated. In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love, but had left to calm Harriet. Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters {{over the course of the}} following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.|$|E
5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E

In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans to participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents.

5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
5|$|They reached Spanish Guinea in February and {{surrendered}} to the unaligned representatives of Spain under the Restoration. The Spanish government of Álvaro Figueroa Torres gave the Beti land to settle and agreed to transport the Germans to the nearby island of Fernando Po. Atangana and {{members of his family}} accompanied them. In 1918, the Germans sent Atangana and six other chiefs to Spain, where they would witness if necessary that the Germans <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> their African subjects humanely. In September 1919, Atangana had an audience with King Alfonso XIII of Spain and urged him to support the Germans in these proceedings. Atangana remained in Madrid for two years and stayed a month in Barcelona to retrieve money he had deposited through the Basel Mission.|$|E
5|$|When the Christian Alfonso VI of Castile retook the Kingdom of Toledo {{from the}} Moors in 1085, an Arabic {{translation}} of Aristotle's works, with commentaries by Avicenna and Averroes emerged into European medieval scholarship. Michael Scot translated much of Aristotle's biology into Latin, c. 1225, {{along with many}} of Averroes's commentaries. Albert of Cologne commented extensively on Aristotle, but added his own zoological observations and an encyclopedia of animals based on Thomas of Cantimpré. Later in the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas merged Aristotle's metaphysics with Christian theology. Whereas Albert <b>had</b> <b>treated</b> Aristotle's biology as science, writing that experiment was the only safe guide and joining in with the types of observation that Aristotle had made, Aquinas saw Aristotle purely as theory, and Aristotelian thought became associated with pointless scholasticism. The scholastic natural philosophy curriculum omitted most of Aristotle's biology, but included On the Soul.|$|E
