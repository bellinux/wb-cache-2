The RAMS modeling was coupled with a one-dimensional (1 -D) below-cloud and <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> model in order to simulate the scavenging processes. RAMS modeling was also used in order to simulate the cloud structures. Real-time measurements of ammonia, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide and the water-soluble inorganic aerosol species, ammonium, nitrate, chloride, and sulfate were performed at a pasture site in the Amazon Basin (Rondonia, Brazil) during LBA/DRY-TO-WET campaign (September and November 2002) and LBA/SMOCC campaign (Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia - Smoke Aerosols, Clouds, Rainfall, and Climate: Aerosols From Biomass Burning Perturb Global and Regional Climate) (12 September to 14 November 2002). The concentrations of gases and particles in the samplings, {{as well as the}} meteorological parameters obtained during the campaign (during the transition period, between the late dry season and the onset of the wet season) were the input data in both models. Gamma distribution adjusted for the each case and Levine & Schwartz, 1982 droplet spectra were also used in order to compare the rainwater concentration species due the <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The aim of the modeling was to predict the average concentration of three chemical species found in rainwater: SO 42 -, NO 3 - and NH 4, scavenged from the atmosphere.

40|$|Atmospheric {{carbonaceous}} aerosols play {{an important}} role in the climate system by influencing the Earth's radiation budgets and modifying the cloud properties. Despite the importance, their representations in large-scale atmospheric models are still crude, which can influence model simulated burden, lifetime, physical, chemical and optical properties, and the climate forcing of carbonaceous aerosols. In this study, we improve the current three-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM 3) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM 5) by introducing an additional primary carbon mode to explicitly account for the microphysical ageing of primary carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere. Compared to MAM 3, the four-mode version of MAM (MAM 4) significantly increases the column burdens of primary particulate organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) by up to 40  % in many remote regions, where <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> plays an important role in determining the aerosol concentrations. Differences in the column burdens for other types of aerosol (e. g., sulfate, secondary organic aerosols, mineral dust, sea salt) are less than 1  %. Evaluating the MAM 4 simulation against in situ surface and aircraft observations, we find that MAM 4 significantly improves the simulation of seasonal variation of near-surface BC concentrations in the polar regions, by increasing the BC concentrations in all seasons and particularly in cold seasons. However, it exacerbates the overestimation of modeled BC concentrations in the upper troposphere in the Pacific regions. The comparisons suggest that, to address the remaining model POM and BC biases, future improvements are required related to (1) <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> and vertical transport in convective clouds and (2) emissions of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols...|$|E

The sandy soil consisted primarily of quartz (silica) particles, 30 to 500 microns in diameter, and also contained seashell fragments. Differential and cumulative soil-mass size distributions are presented along with mineralogy, elemental compositions, and solution pH histories. About 90 percent of the soil mass consisted of particles 165 microns in diameter. Characteristic reaction times in aqueous HC 1 slurries varied from a few minutes to several days, and capacities for reaction under acidic conditions varied from 10 to 40 g HCl/kg soil, depending on particle size. Airborne lifetimes of particles 165 microns are conservatively 30 min, and this major grouping is predicted to represent a small short-term chemical sink for up to 5 % of the total HC 1. The smaller and more minor fractions, below a 165 micron diameter, may act as giant cloud condensation nuclei over much longer airborne lifetimes.

Solution of the transient problem is obtained, and the evaporation rate is determined. It is shown that for droplets of ideal solution with different compositions, Nusselt and Sherwood numbers depend on the concentration of components inside each droplet. When dense cloud contains both pure droplets and droplets containing soluble nuclei, interactions between temperature and concentra-tion fields causes growth of some droplets in a cluster and evaporation of the other droplets. It is shown that inside an evaporating large cluster of multicomponent droplets composed of volatile components, recondensation occurs whereby evaporat-ing droplets act as mass sources and heat sinks and growing droplets act as mass sink and heat sources.

GLOMAP-mode simulates the multi-component global aerosol, resolving sulphate, sea-salt, dust, black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), the latter including primary and biogenic secondary POM. Aerosol processes are simulated in a size-resolved manner including primary emissions, secondary particle formation by binary homogeneous nucleation of sulphuric acid and water, particle growth by coagulation, condensation and cloud-processing and removal by dry deposition, <b>in-cloud</b> and below-cloud <b>scavenging.</b> A series of benchmark observational datasets are assembled against which the skill of the model is assessed in terms of normalised mean bias (b) and correlation coefficient (R). Overall, the model performs well against the datasets in simulating concentrations of aerosol precursor gases, chemically speciated particle mass, condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Surface sulphate, sea-salt and dust mass concentrations are all captured well, while BC and POM are biased low (but correlate well). Surface CN concentrations compare reasonably well in free troposphere and marine sites, but are underestimated at continental and coastal sites related to underestimation of either primary particle emissions or new particle formation. The model compares well against a compilation of CCN observations covering a range of environments and against vertical profiles of size-resolved particle concentrations over Europe.

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} cloud nucleation scavenging scheme, which determines {{stratiform cloud}} scavenging ratios for both aerosol mass and number distributions, based on cloud droplet, and ice crystal number concentrations, is {{introduced into the}} ECHAM 5 -HAM global climate model. This scheme is coupled with a size-dependent in-cloud impaction scavenging parameterization for both cloud droplet-aerosol, and ice crystal-aerosol collisions. The aerosol mass scavenged in stratiform clouds {{is found to be}} primarily (&gt; 90 %) scavenged by cloud nucleation processes for all aerosol species, except for dust (50 %). The aerosol number scavenged is primarily (&gt; 90 %) attributed to impaction. 99 % of this impaction scavenging occurs in clouds with temperatures less than 273 K. Sensitivity studies are presented, which compare aerosol concentrations, burdens, and deposition for a variety of <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> approaches: prescribed fractions, a more computationally expensive prognostic aerosol cloud processing treatment, and the new diagnostic scheme, also with modified assumptions about in-cloud impaction and nucleation scavenging. Our results show that while uncertainties in the representation of <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> processes can lead to differences in the range of 20 – 30 % for the predicted annual, global mean aerosol mass burdens, and near to 50 % for accumulation mode aerosol number burden, the differences in predicted aerosol mass concentrations can be up to one order of magnitude, particularly for regions of the middle troposphere with temperatures below 273 K where mixed and ice phase clouds exist. Different parameterizations for impaction scavenging changed the predicted global, annual mean number removal attributed to ice clouds by seven-fold, and the global, annual dust mass removal attributed to impaction by two orders of magnitude. Closer agreement with observations of black carbon profiles from aircraft (increases near to one order of magnitude for mixed phase clouds), mid-troposphere 210 Pb vertical profiles, and the geographic distribution of aerosol optical depth is found for the new diagnostic scavenging scheme compared to the prescribed scavenging fraction scheme of the standard ECHAM 5 -HAM.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{processes}} and conditions favouring {{the formation of}} nanoparticles (diameter &lt; 10 nm) which are frequently observed on high mountains reaching the low free troposphere. This was done through an analysis of a data set collected at Izaña Global Atmospheric Watch Observatory (Canary Islands; 2367 m a. s. l.). This high mountain supersite is located well above the stratocumulus layer characteristic of the subtropical oceanic tropospheres. At night, when the catabic flow regime is well established, free troposphere aerosols were measured. The development of orographic buoyant upward flows during daylight resulted in an increase of water vapour, SO 2 and NOy concentrations. These ascending airflows perturbed the free troposphere and resulted in high concentrations of 3 – 10 nm particles (N 3 - 10 ) due to new particle formation. An analysis of the 5 -min average time series allowed the identification of two main types of N 3 - 10 event. In Type I events a linear relationship between N 3 - 10 and SO 2 was observed (r 2 coefficients 0. 70 – 0. 95 and a mean slope of 11 cm&minus; 3 · ppt&minus; 1 for 5 -min averaged data; SO 2 concentrations from tens to hundreds of ppt). These particles seem to be formed during upward transport (probably within or after the outflows of clouds located below Izaña). During Type II events, no correlation between SO 2 and N 3 - 10 was observed and 3 – 10 nm particles were formed in-situ at noon and during the afternoon due to the condensation of vapours linked to photochemistry. New particle formation was observed almost every day owing to the favourable conditions associated with the entry of boundary layer air in the low free troposphere, even if SO 2 concentrations are rather low at Izaña (tens to hundreds of ppt). The low surface area of pre-existing particles, low temperature and high radiation intensity clearly favoured the formation of nanoparticles. The low surface area of pre-existing particles in the upward flows is furthered by <b>in-cloud</b> particles <b>scavenging</b> in the stratocumulus layer typically located below Izaña. The higher temperature {{and the presence of}} coarse Saharan dust particles decrease the efficiency of the new particle formation mechanisms in summer. Thus, the "N 3 - 10 versus SO 2 " slope (for r 2 > 0. 7 cases) was higher in autumn and winter (~ 15 cm&minus; 3 · ppt&minus; 1 as average) than in summer (2 – 8 cm&minus; 3 · ppt&minus; 1 ).

The microphysical properties of orographic clouds and subsequent formation of precipitation are impacted, in part, by aerosols of varying size, number, and chemical composition, which are incorporated into clouds formed along the Sierra barrier. Herein, the physicochemical properties and sources of insoluble residues and soluble ions found in precipitation samples were explored for three sites of variable elevation in the Sierra Nevada during the 2012 – 2013 winter season. Residues were characterized using a suite of physicochemical techniques to determine the size‐resolved number concentrations and associated chemical composition. A transition in the aerosol sources that served as cloud seeds or were <b>scavenged</b> <b>in‐cloud</b> and below‐cloud was observed as a function of location and elevation. Anthropogenic influence from the Central Valley was dominant at the two lowest elevation sites (1900 and 2200 [*]m above mean sea level (AMSL)), whereas long‐range transported mineral dust was a larger contributor at the highest elevation site where cleaner conditions were observed (2600 [*]m AMSL). The residues and soluble ions observed provide insight into how multiple aerosol sources can impact cloud and precipitation formation processes, even over relatively small spatial scales.

The typical PNSDs during individual meteorological phenomena were compared, and {{the change in the}} concentrations before and after the beginning of the phenomenon, the scavenging coefficient ls, and the rate of change of the AA concentrations with time were computed. It was found that both obscurities and precipitation have a strong influence on theAAconcentrations, both on the total number concentrations and on the PNSDs. The presence of phenomena even changes the number of modes on the PNSDs. The PNSD main mode is shifted to the larger particles, and the concentrations of particles smaller than 50 nm in diameter are considerably lower. In nucleation mode, however, wet scavenging {{does not seem to be}} the main process influencing the AA concentrations, although its considerable effect on the concentration was proved. During obscurities, there is a typical PNSD to which the PNSDs converge at any mist/fog/shallow fog event. The concentrations of AA particles smaller than 80 nm are lower than they are during periods without any phenomenon recorded, and the concentrations of the strongly prevailing accumulation mode are higher. During liquid precipitation, PNSDs are lower when compared to non-event periods. With larger droplets of the phenomenon, the position of the main mode of the bimodal PNSDs is shifted to the smaller particles. The process of gas-to-particle conversion takes place in the breaks from precipitation during a rain showers period. Precipitation containing frozen hydrometeors behaves differently from liquid precipitation. Concentrations of AA particles larger than 200 nm during precipitation containing solid particles do not differ from non-event cases, suggesting insignificant scavenging...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} profile of aerosol {{is important for}} its radiative effects, but weakly constrained by observations on the global scale, and highly variable among different models. To investigate the controlling factors in one particular model, we investigate the effects of individual processes in HadGEM 3 –UKCA and compare the resulting diversity of aerosol {{vertical profile}}s with the inter-model diversity from the AeroCom Phase II control experiment. In this way we show that (in this model at least) the vertical profile is controlled by {{a relatively small number}} of processes, although these vary among aerosol components and particle sizes. We also show that sufficiently coarse variations in these processes can produce a similar diversity to that among different models in terms of the global-mean profile and, to a lesser extent, the zonal-mean vertical position. However, there are features of certain models' profiles that cannot be reproduced, suggesting the influence of further structural differences between models. In HadGEM 3 –UKCA, convective transport is found to be very important in controlling the vertical profile of all aerosol components by mass. <b>In-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> is very important for all except mineral dust. Growth by condensation is important for sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol (along with aqueous oxidation for the former and ageing by soluble material for the latter). The vertical extent of biomass-burning emissions into the free troposphere is also important for the profile of carbonaceous aerosol. Boundary-layer mixing plays a dominant role for sea salt and mineral dust, which are emitted only from the surface. Dry deposition and below-cloud scavenging are important for the profile of mineral dust only. In this model, the microphysical processes of nucleation, condensation and coagulation dominate the vertical profile of the smallest particles by number (e. g. total CN [*]>[*]  3 nm), while the profiles of larger particles (e. g.

We differentiate riming- versus WBF-dominated <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> based on liquid water content (LWC) and temperature. Specifically, we implement an implied WBF parameterization using either temperature or ice mass fraction (IMF) in mixed-phase clouds based on field measurements. We find that at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, and Abisko, Sweden, where WBF dominates <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging,</b> including the WBF effect strongly reduces the discrepancies of simulated BC scavenging efficiency and washout ratio against observations (from a factor of 3 to 10  % and from a factor of 4 – 5 to a factor of 2). However, at Zeppelin, Norway, where riming dominates, simulation of BC scavenging efficiency, BC air, and washout ratio become worse (relative to observations) when WBF is included. There is thus an urgent need for extensive observations to distinguish and characterize riming- versus WBF-dominated aerosol scavenging in mixed-phase clouds and the associated BC scavenging efficiency. Our model results show that including the WBF effect lowers global BC scavenging efficiency, with a higher reduction at higher latitudes (8  % in the tropics and up to 76  % in the Arctic). The resulting annual mean BC air increases by up to 156  % at high altitudes and at northern high latitudes because of lower temperature and higher IMF. Overall, WBF halves the model–observation discrepancy (from − 65 to − 30  %) of BC air across North America, Europe, China and the Arctic. Globally WBF increases BC burden from 0. 22 to 0. 29 – 0. 35  mg m − 2  yr − 1, which partially explains the gap between observed and previous model-simulated BC burdens over land. In addition, WBF significantly increases BC lifetime from 5. 7 to [*]∼[*]  8  days. Additionally, WBF results in a significant redistribution of BC deposition in source and remote regions. Specifically, it lowers BC wet deposition (by 37 – 63  % at northern mid-latitudes and by 21 – 29  % in the Arctic), while it increases dry deposition (by 3 – 16  % at mid-latitudes and by 81 – 159  % in the Arctic). The resulting total BC deposition is lower at mid-latitudes (by 12 – 34  %) but higher in the Arctic (by 2 – 29  %). We find that WBF decreases BC snow at mid-latitudes (by [*]∼[*]  15  %) but increases it in the Arctic (by 26  %) while improving model comparisons with observations. In addition, WBF dramatically reduces the model–observation discrepancy of washout ratios in winter (from a factor of 16 to 4). The remaining discrepancies in BC air, BC snow and BC washout ratios suggest that in-cloud removal in mixed-phased clouds is likely still excessive over land...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of scavenging processes {{has been compared}} with data obtained for rainwater and aerosol chemistry at Serra do Navio, {{in the state of}} Amapa´ in the Brazilian Amazon region. Sulfate, nitrate and ammonium concentrations were determined in rainwater samples collected from May 1995 until June 1997. The levels of these same chemicals were also determined in aerosols for the same period and region. Scavenging processes have been evaluated on a rainfall event basis, via numerical modeling, in order to simulate the rainwater concentrations and compare them with the observed data. RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) was used to simulate cloud structures. A model of below-cloud scavenging was evaluated, as well. The determinations made from the results of the scavenging model are the following: a) aerosol vertical profiles are quite important to rainwater concentrations; b) modeled sulfate in rainwater is a better fit to the observed data values than ammonium and nitrate; c) the obtained sulfate aerosol concentrations samples are similar to ones found in the literature, although the sulfate concentrations in rainwater are much lower than other studies in the literature; d) the <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> process dominates, e) our modeled results, using an input gas vertical profile extracted from the ABLE 2 B experimental data set, present a smaller ratio between gas and aerosol scavenging than found in other studies in the literature, other studies may have had larger rainfall times, which increase the importance of gas phase scavenging.

40|$|Droplet {{deposition}} during fog {{is shown}} {{to play an important}} role in the removal of anthropogenic pollutants from the atmosphere. Relevant theoretical principles are reviewed, and a survey of previous investigations is made. Results of extensive field monitoring programs are presented, and characterizations of fog chemistry and deposition in several environments are reported. The <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> of aerosols and soluble gases coupled with the small size of fog droplets are found to result in higher chemical concentrations in fogwater than in rainwater. In the urban regions of southern California and the southern San Joaquin Valley, fogwater chemistry is dominated by sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium ions, which are measured at millimolar levels. High fog- and cloudwater acidities (pH 2 to 4) are routinely found in the western Los Angeles basin where ammonia emissions are low. San Joaquin Valley fogwater samples are less acidic due to greater ammonia release from local sources. The formation of fog {{is shown to}} accelerate deposition rates for water-scavenged atmospheric constituents. Surrogate-surface measurements made in the San Joaquin Valley indicate that major species were removed at rates 5 to 20 times greater during fogs compared to nonfoggy periods. During stagnation episodes, pollutant removal by ventilation of valley air requires at least 5 days, while the enhancement of deposition by fog formation leads to pollutant lifetimes on the order of 6 - 12 h. Thus, in an environment characterized by flat, open landscape and low wind speed, droplet sedimentation can be the dominant removal mechanism of pollutants during prolonged stagnation episodes with fog...|$|E
40|$|The {{life time}} of {{atmospheric}} aerosols is highly affected by <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> processes. Aerosol mass conversion from aerosols embedded in cloud droplets into aerosols embedded in raindrops is a pivotal pathway for wet removal of aerosols in clouds. The aerosol mass conversion {{rate in the}} bulk microphysics parameterizations is always assumed to be linearly related to the precipitation production rate, which includes the cloud water autoconversion rate and the cloud water accretion rate. The ratio of the aerosol mass concentration conversion rate to the cloud aerosol mass concentration has typically been {{considered to be the}} same as the ratio of the precipitation production rate to the cloud droplet mass concentration. However, the mass of an aerosol embedded in a cloud droplet is not linearly proportional to the mass of the cloud droplet. A simple linear relationship cannot be drawn between the precipitation production rate and the aerosol mass concentration conversion rate. In this paper, we studied the evolution of aerosol mass concentration conversion rates in a warm rain formation process with a 1. 5 -dimensional non-hydrostatic convective cloud and aerosol interaction model in the bin microphysics. We found that the ratio of the aerosol mass conversion rate to the cloud aerosol mass concentration can be statistically expressed by the ratio of the precipitation production rate to the cloud droplet mass concentration with an exponential function. We further gave some regression equations to determine aerosol conversions in the warm rain formation under different threshold radii of raindrops and different aerosol size distributions...|$|E
40|$|A {{diagnostic}} nucleation scavenging scheme, which determines {{stratiform cloud}} scavenging ratios for both aerosol mass and number distributions, based on cloud droplet, and ice crystal number concentrations, is {{introduced into the}} ECHAM 5 -HAM global climate model. This is coupled with a size-dependent in-cloud impaction scavenging parameterization for both cloud droplet-aerosol, and ice crystal-aerosol collisions. Sensitivity studies are presented, which compare aerosol concentrations, and deposition between a variety of <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> approaches, including prescribed fractions, several diagnostic schemes, and a prognostic aerosol cloud processing treatment that passes aerosol in-droplet and in-ice crystal concentrations between model time steps. For one sensitivity study, assuming 100 % of the in-cloud aerosol is scavenged into the cloud droplets and ice crystals, the annual global mean accumulation mode number burden is decreased by 65 %, relative to a simulation with prognostic aerosol cloud processing. Diagnosing separate nucleation scavenging ratios for aerosol number and mass distributions, as opposed to equating the aerosol mass scavenging to the number scavenging ratios, reduces the annual global mean sulfate burden by near to 10 %. The annual global mean sea salt burden is 30 % lower for the diagnostic approach, which does not carry aerosol in-droplet and in-crystal concentrations between model time-steps {{as compared to the}} prognostic scheme. Implementation of in-cloud impaction scavenging reduced the annual, global mean black carbon burden by 30 % for the prognostic aerosol cloud processing scheme. Better agreement with observations of black carbon profiles from aircraft (changes near to one order of magnitude for mixed phase clouds), 210 Pb surface layer concentrations and wet deposition, and the geographic distribution of aerosol optical depth are found for the new diagnostic scavenging as compared to prescribed ratio scavenging scheme of the standard ECHAM 5 -HAM...|$|E
40|$|A tracer model, DREAM (the Danish Rimpuff and Eulerian Accidental release Model), {{has been}} {{developed}} for modelling transport, dispersion and deposition (wet and dry) of radioactive material from accidental releases, as the Chernobyl accident. The model {{is a combination of}} a Lagrangian model, that includes the near source dispersion, and an Eulerian model describing the long-range transport. The performance of the transport model has previously been tested within the European Tracer Experiment, ETEX, which included transport and dispersion of an inert, non-depositing tracer from a controlled release. The focus of this paper is the model performance with respect to the total deposition of  137 Cs, 134 Cs and 131 I from the Chernobyl accident, using different relatively simple and comprehensive parameterizations for dry- and wet deposition. The performance, compared to measurements, of using different combinations of two different wet deposition parameterizations and three different parameterizations of dry deposition has been evaluated, using different statistical tests. The best model performance, compared to measurements, is obtained when parameterizing the total deposition combined of a simple method for dry deposition and a subgrid-scale averaging scheme for wet deposition based on relative humidities. The same major conclusion is obtained for all the three different radioactive isotopes and using two different deposition measurement databases. Large differences are seen in the results obtained by using the two different parameterizations of wet deposition based on precipitation rates and relative humidities, respectively. The parameterization based on subgrid-scale averaging is, in all cases, performing better than the parameterization based on precipitation rates. This indicates that the <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> process {{is more important than the}} below cloud scavenging process for the submicron particles and that the precipitation rates are relatively uncertain in the meteorological model compared to the relative humidity. Relatively small differences are, however, seen in the statistical tests between the three different parameterizations of dry deposition...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols and cloud {{water were}} {{analyzed}} at a mountaintop in the {{planetary boundary layer}} in southern China during March-May 2009, when two Asian dust storms occurred, to investigate the effects of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) on chemical evolution of atmospheric trace elements. Fe, Al, and Zn predominated in both coarse and fine aerosols, followed by high concentrations of toxic Pb, As, and Cd. Most of these aerosol trace elements, which were affected by dust storms, exhibited various increases in concentrations but consistent decreases in solubility. Zn, Fe, Al, and Pb were the most abundant trace elements in cloud water. The trace element concentrations exhibited logarithmic inverse relationships with the cloud liquid water content and were found highly pH dependent with minimum concentrations {{at the threshold of}} pH similar to 5. 0. The calculation of Visual MINTEQ model showed that 80. 7 - 96. 3 % of Fe(II), Zn(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II) existed in divalent free ions, while 71. 7 % of Fe(III) and 71. 5 % of Al(III) were complexed by oxalate and fluoride, respectively. ACIs could markedly change the speciation distributions of trace elements in cloud water by pH modification. The <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> of aerosol trace elements likely reached a peak after the first 2 - 3 h of cloud processing, with scavenging ratios between 0. 12 for Cr and 0. 57 for Pb. The increases of the trace element solubility (4 - 33 %) were determined in both in-cloud aerosols and postcloud aerosols. These results indicated the significant importance of aerosol-cloud interactions to the evolution of trace elements during the first several cloud condensation/evaporation cycles.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} and {{evaluates the}} second {{version of the}} global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAM. Major changes have been brought into the model, including new parameterizations for aerosol nucleation and water uptake, an explicit treatment of secondary organic aerosols, modified emission calculations for sea salt and mineral dust, the coupling of aerosol microphysics to a two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme, and alternative wet scavenging parameterizations. These revisions extend the model's capability to represent details of the aerosol lifecycle and its interaction with climate. Sensitivity experiments are carried out to analyse {{the effects of these}} improvements in the process representation on the simulated aerosol properties and global distribution. The new parameterizations that have largest impact on the global mean aerosol optical depth and radiative effects {{turn out to be the}} water uptake scheme and cloud microphysics. The former leads to a significant decrease of aerosol water contents in the lower troposphere, and consequently smaller optical depth; the latter results in higher aerosol loading and longer lifetime due to weaker <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The combined effects of the new/updated parameterizations are demonstrated by comparing the new model results with those from the earlier version, and against observations. Model simulations are evaluated in terms of aerosol number concentrations against measurements collected from twenty field campaigns as well as from fixed measurement sites, and in terms of optical properties against the AERONET measurements. Results indicate a general improvement with respect to the earlier version. The aerosol size distribution and spatial-temporal variance simulated by HAM 2 are in better agreement with the observations. Biases in the earlier model version in aerosol optical depth and in the Ångström parameter have been reduced. The paper also points out the remaining model deficiencies that need to be addressed in the future...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric sulfur (S) {{deposition}} via precipitation, {{particles and}} gases was investigated at ten sites in Northern China. Measurements were performed continuously between December 2007 and November 2010. The total S deposition flux {{in the target}} area ranged from 35. 0 to 100. 7 kg S ha − 1 yr − 1, noticeably higher than the values documented in Europe, North America, and East Asia. The ten-site, 3 -yr average total S deposition was 64. 8 kg S ha − 1 yr − 1, with 68 % attributed to dry deposition (mainly SO 2) and the rest to wet deposition. Consequently, the spatial distribution of the total flux was consistent to that of dry deposition, that is, higher values were observed at industrial and urban sites than at agricultural and rural sites. However, the seasonal variation in the total S deposition was not obvious across the entire year because of opposite seasonal trends in wet and dry deposition. It {{was found that the}} wet deposition, without significant spatial and interannual differences, was influenced by the volume of precipitation, the air-column concentrations of S compounds and <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Similar to the wet deposition, the dry-deposited sulfate was also less dependent on the surface concentration. Nevertheless, the regional differences in SO 2 dry deposition were mostly explained by the ambient concentration, which is closely associated with local emissions. As expected, the spatial pattern of total S deposition resembled that of the emission inventory, indicating the dramatic anthropogenic imprints on the regional S budget. Although at most of the study sites the "acid equivalents" deposition of S was comparable to that of nitrogen (N), the importance of S in the acidification risks was more pronounced at the industrial sites. The ten-site, 3 -yr mean total "acid equivalents" deposition of S and N was estimated to be 8. 4 (range: 4. 2 – 11. 6) keq ha − 1 yr − 1, which exceeds the critical loads for natural ecosystems in Northern China. Taking these findings and our previous studies together, a multi-pollutant perspective and joint mitigation strategies to abate SO 2 and NH 3 simultaneously in the target area are recommended to protect natural ecosystems from excess acid deposition...|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{variations}} {{in the amount of}} radionuclides released into the atmosphere during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FNPS 1) accident and their atmospheric and marine dispersion are essential to evaluate the environmental impacts and resultant radiological doses to the public. In this paper, we estimate the detailed atmospheric releases during the accident using a reverse estimation method which calculates the release rates of radionuclides by comparing measurements of air concentration of a radionuclide or its dose rate in the environment with the ones calculated by atmospheric and oceanic transport, dispersion and deposition models. The atmospheric and oceanic models used are WSPEEDI-II (Worldwide version of System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) and SEA-GEARN-FDM (Finite difference oceanic dispersion model), both developed by the authors. A sophisticated deposition scheme, which deals with dry and fog-water depositions, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation, and subsequent wet scavenging due to mixed-phase cloud microphysics (<b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging)</b> for radioactive iodine gas (I 2 and CH 3 I) and other particles (CsI, Cs, and Te), was incorporated into WSPEEDI-II to improve the surface deposition calculations. The results revealed that the major releases of radionuclides due to the FNPS 1 accident occurred in the following periods during March 2011 : the afternoon of 12 March due to the wet venting and hydrogen explosion at Unit 1, midnight of 14 March when the SRV (safety relief valve) was opened three times at Unit 2, the morning and night of 15 March, and the morning of 16 March. According to the simulation results, the highest radioactive contamination areas around FNPS 1 were created from 15 to 16 March by complicated interactions among rainfall, plume movements, and the temporal variation of release rates. The simulation by WSPEEDI-II using the new source term reproduced the local and regional patterns of cumulative surface deposition of total 131 I and 137 Cs and air dose rate obtained by airborne surveys. The new source term was also tested using three atmospheric dispersion models (Modèle Lagrangien de Dispersion de Particules d'ordre zéro: MLDP 0, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model: HYSPLIT, and Met Office's Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment: NAME) for regional and global calculations, and the calculated results showed good agreement with observed air concentration and surface deposition of 137 Cs in eastern Japan...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} {{interfaces}} (Linux scripts and FORTRAN codes) are created as to link those models with different types input {{information in a}} system able to perform long term calculations. Meteorological driver {{of the system is}} the ALADIN weather forecasting model Spiridonov et al. (2005) operating in this case in special mode. In spite MM 5 performs full meteorological modelling, here it is used as a kind of dynamical pre-processor in space and time. The domain’s vertical profile contained 23 σ-levels of varying thickness, extending up to 100  hPa height. Proper physical options are set in MM 5. The speciation procedure is dependent on the Chemical Mechanism (CM) used. CMAQ supports different CMs. Here, the Carbon Bond, v. 4 (CB 4) is exploited. The basis of the CB- 4 mechanism is that reactivity of organic compounds in the atmosphere can reasonably be simulated by mechanism species that represent different carbon bond types. In the time passing CB 4 has undergone several changes since its publication. In particular particle mater chemistry is added. In the used Version 4.6 of CMAQ the CB 4 is upgraded with the Version 1.7 of ISORROPIA aerosol model Nenes et al. (1998). According to this combined mechanism (CB 4 -aero 3) 10 organic and 5  PM 2.5 spices are input in addition to the other inorganic gases. Most of the organic species in CB 4 represent carbon-carbon bond types, but ethene (ETH), isoprene (ISOP) and formaldehyde (FORM) are represented explicitly. A new method for computing the vertical velocity has been implemented which follows the omega calculation in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model but using CMAQ’s advection schemes to compute horizontal mass divergence. It’s a two step process where first the continuity equation is integrated through the column to get the change in column mass and then solve for omega layer-by-layer using the horizontal mass divergence. The new scheme is much less diffusive in the upper layers because it is constrained to have zero flux at the model top. The dry deposition is modeled using the electrical resistance method. The wet removal processes can proceed first with the cloud droplet formation via several mechanisms including heterogeneous nucleation and aerosol activation, then with <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> by existing cloud droplets or below-cloud scavenging by falling precipitation or both. All of these processes influence the amount and composition of the ground-level rainwater. Therefore, an accurate parameterization scheme, describing all these processes is incorporated in the system.|$|E
40|$|The wet {{removal of}} black carbon aerosol (BC) in the {{atmosphere}} is a crucial factor in determining its atmospheric lifetime and thereby the vertical and horizontal distributions, dispersion on local and regional scales, and the direct, semi-direct and indirect radiative forcing effects. The <b>in-cloud</b> <b>scavenging</b> and wet deposition rate of freshly emitted hydrophobic BC will be increased on acquisition of more-hydrophilic components by coagulation or coating processes. The lifetime of BC is still subject to considerable uncertainty {{for most of the}} model inputs, which is largely due to the insufficient constraints on the BC hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic conversion process from observational field data. This study was conducted at a site along UK North Norfolk coastline, where the BC particles were transported from different regions within Western Europe. A hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyser (HTDMA) was coupled with a single particle soot photometer (SP 2) to measure the hygroscopic properties of BC particles and associated mixing state in real time. In addition, a Soot Particle AMS (SP-AMS) measured the chemical compositions of additional material associated with BC particles. The ensemble of BC particles persistently contained a less-hygroscopic mode at a growth factor (gf) of around 1. 05 at 90 % RH (dry diameter 163 nm). Importantly, a more-hygroscopic mode of BC particles was observed throughout the experiment, the gf of these BC particles extended up to ~ 1. 4 – 1. 6 with the minimum between this and the less hygroscopic mode at a gf ~ 1. 25, or equivalent effective hygroscopicity parameter κ ~ 0. 1. The gf of BC particles (gfBC) was highly influenced by the composition of associated soluble material: increases of gfBC were associated with secondary inorganic components, and these increases were more pronounced when ammonium nitrate was in the BC particles; however the presence of secondary organic matter suppressed the gfBC below that of pure inorganics. The Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule captures the hygroscopicity contributions from different compositions within ± 30 % compared to the measured results, however is subject to uncertainty due to the complex morphology of BC component and potential artefacts associated with semivolatile particles measured with the HTDMA. This study provides detailed insights on BC hygroscopicity associated with its mixing state, and the results will importantly constrain the microphysical mixing schemes of BC as used by a variety of high level models. In particular, this provides direct evidence to highlight the need to consider ammonium nitrate ageing of BC particles because this will result in particles becoming hydrophilic on much shorter timescales than for sulphate formation, which is often the only mechanism considered...|$|E
