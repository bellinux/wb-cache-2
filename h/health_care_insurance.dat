25|$|A 2011 {{view of the}} data, {{released}} by the state in 2013, shows {{the number of people}} receiving employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) in Massachusetts has decreased by approximately 500,000 people (about 8% of the state population) since the enactment of the Massachusetts health insurance law in 2006. (The state of Massachusetts stopped putting out regular information on various types of insurance enrollment altogether between 2011 and 2013; prior to 2011, it released such data quarterly. In 2013, the state released 2011 data.)

25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>insurance.</b> Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much {{of the cost of}} health care, but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a deductible), or {{a small part of the}} cost of every procedure (a copayment). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.|$|E

In addition, adverse selection exists in the demand for insurance. Income is also a significant determinant of insurance coverage.

Based on the combination of the increased Health Safety Net tax, general revenue (state income and sales taxes were increased 20%) and smaller additional taxes, the cost of the reform reached about 2% of the state's annual budget in fiscal year 2013, which ended June 30, 2013, up from 1.5% in fiscal 2011.|$|E
