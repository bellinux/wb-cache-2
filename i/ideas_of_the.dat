5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis, {{presented}} as a theoretical contribution to <b>the</b> discipline <b>of</b> International Relations, describes <b>the</b> intellectual origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state has a privileged place in International Relations for it is an integral element <b>of</b> Realism, <b>the</b> discipline's dominant intellectual tradition. Realism assumes that the primary actors in the modern international system are states, as identified by their exercise of sovereignty over a delimited space or territory. In Realist history, the territorial state and the modern territorial international order emerged together, twin products of seventeenth century political theory and practice, as signified by political settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace <b>of</b> Westphalia in 1648. This thesis challenges <b>the</b> Realist narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state on two counts: methodologically and historically. First, it rejects the view {{that it is possible}} to account for <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state exclusively in terms of political practice and knowledge. It argues that <b>the</b> Realist <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state needs to be understood as one expression of a much broader and more complex matrix of narratives - social, political, philosophical and cultural - about man's capacity to know, represent and order <b>the</b> spaces <b>of</b> modernity. Second, <b>the</b> thesis rejects the Realist history that dates <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state to the seventeenth century. An alternative chronology is put forward that dates <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state to fifteenth and sixteenth century Renaissance Italy. The thesis argues that <b>the</b> first signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state can be identified in various Renaissance spatial discourses: political, cosmological, artistic and cartographic. These spatial discourses and the practices they led to established the templates for thinking about and representing space in modernity, including those underlying <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern territorial state...|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.|$|E

Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E
