5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s metropolitan planning organization. NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that have a stake in transportation decisions in Central New York. Both parties have yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas and point out concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|Males {{may also}} use more {{indirect}} techniques {{to mate with}} females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{symbiosis}} between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are {{an important aspect of}} both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the endophyte to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end of the continuum. Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through horizontal transmission of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‘seed defence theory’.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a long-running}} and {{vigorous}} debate over ethical concerns regarding circumcision, particularly neonatal circumcision for {{reasons other than}} intended direct medical benefit. There are three parties involved in the decision to circumcise a minor: the minor as the patient, the parents (or other guardians) and the physician. [...] The physician is bound under the ethical principles of beneficence (promoting well-being) and non-maleficence ("first, do no harm"), and so is charged with the responsibility to promote {{the best interests of the}} patient while minimizing unnecessary harms. Those involved must weigh the factors of what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the minor against the potential harms of the procedure.|$|E

2500|$|Comcast {{has also}} earned a {{reputation}} for being anti-union. According to one of the company's training manuals, [...] "Comcast does not feel union representation <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of its employees, customers, or shareholders". A dispute in 2004 with CWA, a labor union that represented many employees at Comcast's offices in Beaverton, Oregon, led to allegations of management intimidating workers, requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members. In 2011, Comcast received criticism from Writers Guild of America for its policies in regards to unions.|$|E

2500|$|Saleh's {{depiction}} is not {{the only}} painted version of Diponegoro's capture. An earlier version, The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock, was completed [...] 1835 by Nicolaas Pieneman on commission by De Kock or his family. Rather than an angry and defiant man, Pieneman presented a submissive and beaten Diponegoro, standing lower than his captor and thus symbolically having less power. Overall, Pieneman's painting gives the impression that, although De Kock is acting sternly in exiling Diponegoro, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the Javanese. The author Susie Protschky describes both Pieneman and Saleh's works as [...] "two of the best known history paintings from the Indies".|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, the Australian Psychological Society stated: [...] "The family studies {{literature}} {{indicates that}} it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children’s wellbeing and ‘outcomes’, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. The research indicates that parenting practices and children’s outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents {{are likely to be}} at least as favourable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families. The main reason given (by law makers) for not allowing people to marry the person of their choice if that person is of the same gender has been the inaccurate assertion that this <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of children, and that children ‘need’ or ‘do better’ in a family with one parent of each gender. As the reviews, statements, and recommendations written by many expert and professional bodies indicate, this assertion is not supported by the family studies research, and in fact, the promotion of this notion, and the laws and public policies that embody it, are clearly counter to the well-being of children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prominent GOP activists campaigned {{to persuade}} {{businessman}} Mitt Romney, {{who had previously}} run for the U.S. Senate from the state, to run for governor.

Romney had previously indicated in fall 2001 that he would not challenge a sitting Republican in running for the Massachusetts governorship, and thus was in a delicate position. [...] Massachusetts Republican State Committee chair Kerry Healey had flown to Utah to personally assess Romney's intentions. [...] On March 17, Romney flew into Massachusetts; a Boston Herald poll showed him defeating Swift by a 75 percent to 12 percent margin in a [...] Republican primary.
