25|$|While {{there have}} been no {{detailed}} studies of <b>desomorphine</b> in its pure form publicly available, it is highly likely that it is not causing the severe inflammation, necrosis, and flesh-eating symptoms of krokodil. Such damages {{are much more likely to}} be related to the toxic chemicals used in the crude at-home synthesis than to <b>desomorphine</b> itself. There is no indication that <b>desomorphine</b> - one of hundreds of known opioids which differ primarily in strength and duration of action - has any unique 'qualities' which would make it desirable to opiate users in its pure form, nor that in pure form <b>desomorphine</b> would cause the symptoms associated with krokodil.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{increasing}} popularity of krokodil is likely {{related to the}} ability of lay persons (with little or no chemistry training or equipment) to chemically produce a heroin-like opiate drug, at home, using readily available solvents and internet-obtained 'recipes' which are posted on drug forums and chat rooms. By using the available, though dangerously unreliable, instructions, users are converting the much cheaper and easier-to-obtain drug codeine, which is often available over-the-counter or with an easily obtained prescription, into <b>desomorphine,</b> a much stronger opiate. With the street price for heroin or oxycodone much higher than the cost of the codeine and chemicals, users manufacture krokodil for a cheaper, comparable high. However, lacking proper equipment, training, and testing equipment, users are extremely unlikely to produce <b>desomorphine</b> in a pure form at home, and as a result end up injecting a highly impure mixture of codeine, <b>desomorphine,</b> and the toxic chemicals used in the crude reaction such as lye or acetone. While studies are as yet unavailable of various samples of krokodil seized in different regions, {{it is likely that the}} drug is in fact not a single chemical, recipe, or 'designer' drug, but rather the medical symptoms caused by the injection of toxic chemical used in a variety of 'home-bake' drug synthesis methods, although traditionally such processes are used by methamphetamine home producers.|$|E
25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), <b>desomorphine</b> (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like <b>desomorphine,</b> hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|More {{research}} is needed to fully define whether krokodil is a drug or a collection of symptoms associated with injecting toxic chemical by-products of home drug chemistry, but since <b>desomorphine</b> is one of hundreds of known opiates in a chemical family with no association to the symptoms, it is much more likely that the drug is a set of symptoms associated with the injection of household chemicals, rather than a specific drug itself. A comparison could be made to the effects of methanol poisoning from illicitly produced alcohol during the U.S. prohibition. Methanol was sometimes added to the distillate to enhance profits. Similarly, it is likely that krokodil is not a drug in itself, but rather, the symptoms of injecting toxic chemicals used in the process and not removed due to the crude process and lack of testing equipment.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} reports of [...] "krokodil"—according to media reports, a street name for <b>desomorphine,</b> a semi-synthetic opioid which has similar {{strength}} and narcotic effect to heroin (diacetylmorphine) -- appearing with increasing frequency in Russia and supposedly, more recently, in the United States. Krokodil, which {{has been associated with}} and indeed named after the severe side-effects of its use, has been described as 'flesh-eating' or, as the name suggests, causing 'greenish and/or scale-like' flesh in those who inject the drug. Reports of the drug's appearance and of the severe skin infections apparently originated in Russia ten years prior to recent appearances in the Phoenix, AZ area of the United States, in the fall of 2013. It was also reported in Joliet, Illinois and McHenry, Illinois in October 2013, but no laboratory tests have confirmed that <b>desomorphine</b> was present in the blood, urine or tissues of hospitalized krokodil patients. On the contrary, an October 17, 2013 article in the Lawton Constitution quoted the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics as saying that reports of krokodil use on the Internet should be [...] "taken with a grain of salt." [...] The article pointed out that a prior case of drug overdose in Oklahoma had been linked to krokodil, but that toxicology tests revealed no <b>desomorphine</b> in the victim's body, but rather morphine, which can appear in tissue as a metabolite of heroin. In Illinois, heroin is known to be extremely cheap and unusually pure, making it unlikely that a drug user would make or purchase krokodil. Further, krokodil is a liquid, while heroin is a powder, and drug users would not be likely to confuse one with the other. In the linkedin.com discussion group [...] "Emerging Drugs of Abuse," [...] with 2500 members in the United States and 43 other countries, toxicology, street drug pharmacology, medical, public health and law enforcement experts expressed doubts about the validity of the krokodil reports after a wave of media stories about the appearance of krokodil in the Chicago area poured from radio, television and print sources. The group believes that the symptoms displayed by krokodil users in the United States are due to a bacterial infection such as necrotizing faciitis, a [...] "flesh eating" [...] disorder that is spread through the sharing of dirty hypodermic needles. This and the fact that krokodil has never been identified anywhere in the world other than Russia bolster the contention that this drug is not in the US.|$|E

50|$|N-Phenethylnordesomorphine is an opiate {{analgesic}} drug derived from <b>desomorphine</b> by replacing the N-methyl group with β-phenethyl. Since <b>desomorphine</b> is already around eight times more potent than morphine, the additional boost in binding affinity produced {{by using the}} larger phenethyl group makes N-phenethylnordesomorphine a highly potent {{analgesic drug}}, some 85x more potent than morphine, and a similar strength to the closely related morphinan derivative phenomorphan.|$|E
50|$|Codeine is also demethylated by {{reaction}} with pyridine {{to synthesize}} morphine, which {{can then be}} acetylated to make heroin (diacetylmorphine).

50|$|<b>Desomorphine</b> has a {{molecular}} weight of 271.35 g/mol and three salts are known: hydrobromide (as {{in the original}} Permonid brand; free-base conversion ratio 0.770), hydrochloride (0.881) and sulfate (0.802). Its freebase form is slightly soluble in water (1.425 g/L at 25 °C), although its salts are very water-soluble; its freebase form is also very soluble in most polar organic solvents (like acetone, ethanol and ethyl acetate). Its melting point is 189 °C. It has a pKa of 9.69. <b>Desomorphine</b> comes in four isoforms, A, B, C, and D and the latter two {{appear to be the}} more researched and used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desomorphine</b> was {{previously}} used in Switzerland and Russia {{for the treatment}} of severe pain; although for many years up to 1981, when its use was terminated, it was being used to treat a single person in Bern, Switzerland with a rare illness. While <b>desomorphine</b> was found to be faster acting and more effective than morphine for the rapid relief of severe pain, its shorter duration of action and the relatively more severe respiratory depression produced at equianalgesic doses, as well as a high incidence of other side effects such as hypotension and urinary retention, were felt to outweigh any potential advantages.|$|E

50|$|The drug can be {{made from}} codeine and iodine derived from {{over-the-counter}} medications and red phosphorus from match strikers, in a process similar to the manufacturing of methamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. Like methamphetamine, <b>desomorphine</b> made this way is often contaminated with various agents. The street name in Russia for homemade <b>desomorphine</b> is krokodil (крокодил, crocodile), possibly related to the chemical name of the precursor α-chlorocodide, or similarity of a skin, damaged by the drug use, to crocodile leather. Due to difficulties in procuring heroin, combined with easy and cheap access to over-the-counter pharmacy products containing codeine in Russia, use of krokodil increased until 2012. In 2012 the Russian federal government introduced new restrictions for the sale of codeine-containing medications. This policy change likely diminished, but did not extinguish krokodil use in Russia. It has been estimated that around 100,000 people use krokodil in Russia and around 20,000 in Ukraine. One death in Poland in December 2011 was also believed to have been caused by krokodil use, and its use has been confirmed among Russian expatriate communities {{in a number of other}} European countries. A single case of <b>desomorphine</b> use was reported in Spain in 2014, with the drug consumed orally rather than by injection.|$|E

50|$|Gangrene, phlebitis, {{thrombosis}} (blood clots), pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia (blood infection), osteomyelitis (bone infection), {{liver and}} kidney damage, brain damage and HIV/AIDS are common serious adverse health effects observed among users of krokodil. Sometimes, the user will miss the vein when injecting the <b>desomorphine,</b> creating an abscess and causing death of the flesh surrounding the entry-point.|$|E
50|$|Phlebitis is {{typically}} caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from {{the insertion of}} an intravenous catheter. However, it can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. Phlebitis can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as <b>desomorphine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Illicitly {{produced}} <b>desomorphine</b> {{is typically}} far from pure and often contains {{large amounts of}} toxic substances {{as a result of}} being [...] "cooked" [...] and used without any significant effort to remove the byproducts and leftovers from synthesis.
