5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|This {{film has}} {{impressed}} {{itself on the}} heart and mind and soul of anyone who has seen it, {{to the extent that}} filmmakers of great originality and distinctiveness like Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah can be said to have remade <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again...</b> without compromising its uniqueness.|$|E

Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: the patient experiences the traumatic event, or pieces of <b>it,</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> Depression is also characteristic for PTSD-patients and may also occur without accompanying PTSD.|$|E

When the {{officers}} heard the story of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they told <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to any reporter who would listen as it was inspirational and heart-warming. In 1938 the novel 'Lassie come home' was published by author Eric Knight and might have been inspired by this tale. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{defended the}} Honinbo title once more, which {{would lead to}} him {{defending}} <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> until 1999. He did terribly (in Cho terms) due to not making it through to the Meijin. In the same year, more international tournaments come to be. These include the Tong Yang Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. Cho wasn't very successful in these, winning only one in 1991, the Fujitsu Cup. He lucked out in the 1991 Fujitsu Cup because his opponent Qian Yuping had health issues {{to pay attention to}} and couldn't compete in the final. He lost the Judan once more and lost the play-off of the Kisei. His record looked better when he ended with 30 wins and 17 losses. 1992 was nothing special. The only events to note are his defending of the Honinbo and losing the semi-final of the Ing Cup. Remnants of the old Cho were coming back with his 31–16 record.|$|E

They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Dancer {{and writer}} Lakshmi Viswanathan, {{who saw the}} film during its {{original}} release in 1956 at the Chennai-based Chitra theatre, wrote for The Hindu 2012, [...] "We children could not contain our excitement when the first colour film in Tamil ... was released in Chitra. We saw <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> with the thrill that only children of those days could experience." [...] Sachi Sri Kantha felt that the Gevacolor looked somewhat [...] "washed out" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] to other colouring processes like Eastmancolor and versions of Fujicolor. He said the film succeeded with the Tamil masses because [...] "it was a first time experience they could enjoy the [...] in totality. This is because illiterate Tamil masses would have watched Hollywood movies produced in [...] for entertainment. But, being illiterate, [...] majority wouldn't have comprehended the dialogues and songs in English." [...] In 2015, Karan Bali wrote for Scroll.in that the film [...] "blended melodious songs, exciting fighting scenes and a suspenseful climax", and praised Veerappa's performance as Abu Hussain. On Ramachandran's centenary in January 2017, Nivedita Mishra of Hindustan Times included his performance in Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum in her list compiling [...] "some of his most memorable performances".|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|The film largely {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. It is [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] on Rotten Tomatoes, having an aggregated score of 81% (based on 62 critics' reviews), {{and an average}} rating of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads [...] "Matthew Broderick charms in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a light and irrepressibly fun movie about being young and having fun." [...] Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "one of the most innocent movies in a long time,” and “a sweet, warm-hearted comedy." [...] Richard Roeper called the film [...] "one of my favorite movies of all time. It {{has one of the highest}} 'repeatability' factors of any film I've ever seen ... I can watch <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> There's also this, and I say it in all sincerity: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is something of a suicide prevention film, or at the very least a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth ... Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if you wake up and embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS". Conservative columnist George Will hailed Ferris as [...] "the moviest movie," [...] a film [...] "most true to the general spirit of the movies, the spirit of effortless escapism." ...|$|E

500|$|... "His Last Vow" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, with Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{saying that}} the episode was [...] "as good a finale as Sherlock's ever had", with a very strong plot. Mark Jefferies of The Mirror called the episode [...] "easily the best yet in this run", with a [...] "fascinating" [...] plot. He also praised Mikkelsen as [...] "brilliant". Josh Wilding, also writing for The Mirror, said the episode [...] "was {{in many ways the}} best episode of Sherlock yet" [...] and called it [...] "simply one of the greatest TV shows of all-time", giving it 5/5. Caroline Frost of the Huffington Post called it a [...] "fitting finale to the series, with writers and actors all saving their best for last", despite the third series' [...] "patchy" [...] performances. Serana Davies of The Telegraph called the episode [...] "the best of the lot" [...] and gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Moffat [...] "the superior Sherlock writer". Although her review was mainly positive, she questioned whether the programme had become [...] "a little vain, rather a show-off". Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said the episode was [...] "perfect", and a [...] "ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence", a sentiment echoed by Ellen Jones of The Independent, who stated that it contained [...] "intelligence, humour and obscure fanboy references galore" [...] which [...] "delivered the goods". She went on to state that it is [...] "enough detail in this episode to justifying watching <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> once weekly, until series four". Chris Harvey of The Telegraph praised the [...] "beautifully done" [...] conclusion of the episode featuring Moriarty, saying it was [...] "very playful, very neat. And very unexpected". Sandipan Deb, writing in Indian newspaper Mint, was positive about the episode, calling it [...] "the best" [...] episode in the series, and praised its [...] "stunning twists and turns, its thrilling upending of what we have known about the characters for a lifetime, an emotional depth not seen before, and its clever throwaway references to the Canon". Deb also praised the [...] "uber-cool cinematic technique", singling out the moment when Sherlock has been shot and falls to the floor as an [...] "extraordinary leap of the imagination and cinematic bravura". However, it was stated that the writers were [...] "influenced by the zoned-out Holmes films directed by Guy Ritchie".|$|E

[...] "This opportunity also does not require me to climb onto [...] bus or plane to do <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> for several consecutive months." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: [...] "This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the season, McGraw went 3–0 with a 0.57 ERA and ten saves. The Mets, meanwhile, went 20–8 from that point forward to pull off the stunning division title. At a July 9 team meeting where Mets Board Chairman M. Donald Grant was trying to encourage the team, McGraw shouted the words, [...] "Ya Gotta Believe" [...] which became a popular rallying cry for the Mets. He said the famous phrase when maybe only he believed the Mets could actually get to the World Series. But soon enough, hearing McGraw say <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> seeing him do his magic in the ninth, the Mets themselves came to believe. They pulled into first place on September 21 with a 10–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and clinched the division crown {{on the final day of}} the season. This marked the only time between 1970 and 1980 that the National League East wasn't won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pirates.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{doctoral}} student at Germany's University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Karlheinz Brandenburg began working on digital music compression in the early 1980s, focusing on how people perceive music. He completed his doctoral work in 1989. MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing {{the outcome of the}} collaboration of Brandenburg—working as a postdoc at AT Labs with James D. Johnston ("JJ") of AT Labs—with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen (where he worked with Bernhard Grill and four other researchers – [...] "The Original Six"), with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic sub-band coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at Erlangen-Nuremberg. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the Fraunhofer Society (in 1993 he joined the staff of the Fraunhofer Institute). The song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] by Suzanne Vega was the first song used by Karlheinz Brandenburg to develop the MP3. Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> each time refining the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} {{referenced}} in episodes of The Simpsons, primarily detailing the obsession Marge Simpson's sisters (Patty and Selma) {{have with the}} show and their crush on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing {{of the show is}} an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode [...] "Black Widower". The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. ("Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.") In another episode, [...] "A Star is Burns", Homer tricks Jay Sherman into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the rain gutter by his underpants, and Bart asks [...] "You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?" [...] Anderson himself is an avid fan of The Simpsons, and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore", which first aired April 9, 2006, where Patty and Selma kidnap Richard Dean Anderson after he admits that he never liked doing MacGyver and only did the show for the money, but eventually gets a thrill out of escaping and annoys them by wanting to do <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 27 on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 2011, adding, [...] "From 'Shake It Out' to the arena-scale Motown of 'Lover to Lover,' Big Red brings <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> choirs and string players backing a voice that soars so high, it makes them seem like ants on the ground below." [...] Clash, on its list of The Top 40 Albums of 2011, included Ceremonials at number 28 and opined that the album [...] "heralded the triumphant return of one of Britain's most exciting pop stars. Bettering the sound she first developed on Lungs, the only problem she faces now is deciding which of its massive songs to release as singles." [...] The NME placed the album at number 31 on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 2011, writing that the album [...] "amounted to pop in its purest sense, as something grand and strange and with ambitions higher than mere humanity, as the triple-headed priestess-muse Florence depicted on its sleeve suggested." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through <b>it</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, he always has new insights to offer." [...] Xun You created 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed to finish writing a book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time to finish writing the book.|$|E
