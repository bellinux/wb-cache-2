5|$|The son {{of farmers}} Malcolm and Hilda Headlam, Frank Headlam {{was born on}} 15July 1914 in Launceston, Tasmania. He was schooled at Clemes College, Hobart, and matriculated in 1932. Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 16January 1934. He {{underwent}} flying <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> No.1 Flying Training School (FTS) at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1January 1935.|$|E
5|$|Kuleli Military High School, {{along the}} shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, located on one of the Princes' Islands, are {{military}} high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French. Other prominent high schools in the city include Istanbul Lisesi (founded in 1884), Kabataş Erkek Lisesi (founded in 1908) and Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi (founded in 1955).|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{departure}} {{provided for}} a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital.|$|E

5|$|In December 1937 {{he began}} flight {{training}} at the No. 7 Elementary Flying School (EFS) at Desford. It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury. He completed his training in formation flying, aerobatics and gunnery practice over the next four months, graduating in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E

25|$|English is {{the medium}} of {{instruction}} for later years in some primary schools, all secondary schools and in higher education. Politically, some Ethiopians regard English medium <b>instruction,</b> <b>with</b> English textbooks, as replacing Ethiopian culture with Western values and loss of identity. The failure of Ethiopia to modernize was because modernization was based on Western values rather than renewal within the Ethiopian tradition. Educational systems foster national unity by inculcating social, cultural and political ideas and these need to become Ethiopian by replacing English <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> instruction in Ethiopian languages. Amharic or Afan Oromo are spoken by more than 60% of Ethiopians, so {{it is essential for}} these languages to be learnt by Ethiopians.|$|E
