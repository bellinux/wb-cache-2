50|$|For {{the initial}} start {{up of the}} reactor neutron sources were located within the core to provide {{sufficient}} neutrons to initiate the nuclear reaction. Other aspects of the design included the use of <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> bars to even out (to some extent) the neutron flux density across the core. If not used, the flux in the centre would be very high relative to the outer areas making control more difficult and leading to excessive central temperatures. Each fuel channel would {{have a number of}} elements stacked one upon another to form a stringer. This required the presence of a latching mechanism to allow the stack to be withdrawn and handled. This caused some problems as the nemonic springs used contained cobalt, which became irradiated giving high gamma level when removed from the reactor. Additionally, thermocouples were attached to a number of elements and needed to be removed on fuel discharge from the reactor.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, mechanical and economic characteristics of fast breeder reactor configurations containing an internal blanket has been performed. This design, called the parfait blanket concept, employs a layer of axial blanket fuel pellets at the core midplane in the fuel pins of the inner enrichment zone; otherwise, the design {{is the same as}} that of the conventional LMFBR's to which the parfait configuration was compared. Two significant advantages were identified for the parfait blanket concept relative to the conventional design. First, the parfait configuration has a 25 % smaller peak fast flux which reduces wrapper tube dilation by 37 % and fuel element elongation by 29 %; and second, axial and radial <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> contribute to a 7. 6 % reduction in the peak fuel burnup. Both characteristics significantly diminish the problems of fuel and metal swelling. Other advantages identified for a typical parfait design include: a 25 % reduction in the burnup reactivity swing, which reduces control rod requirements; a 7 % greater overpower operating margin; an increased breeding ratio, which offsets the disadvantage of a higher critical mass; and more favorable sodium voiding characteristics which counteract the disadvantage of an 8 % smaller power Doppler coefficient. All other characteristics investigated were found to differ insignificantly or slightly favor the parfait design. "January 1974. "Also issued as a Ph.

40|$|String theory {{models of}} axion monodromy {{inflation}} exhibit scalar potentials which are quadratic for small {{values of the}} inflaton field and evolve to a more complicated function for large field values. Oftentimes the large field behaviour is gentler than quadratic, lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This effect, known as flattening, has been observed in the string theory context through {{the properties of the}} DBI+CS D-brane action. We revisit such flattening effects in type IIB flux compactifications with mobile D 7 -branes, with the inflaton identified with the D 7 -brane position. We observe that, with a generic choice of background <b>fluxes,</b> <b>flattening</b> effects are larger than previously observed, allowing to fit these models within current experimental bounds. In particular, we compute the cosmological observables in scenarios compatible with closed-string moduli stabilisation, finding tensor-to-scalar ratios as low as r ~ 0. 04. These are models of single field inflation in which the inflaton is much lighter than the other scalars through a mild tuning of the compactification data. Comment: 56 pages, 11 plot...|$|R
40|$|In January 1997 a large {{fleet of}} NASA and US {{military}} satellites provided {{the most complete}} observations to date {{of the changes in}} 3 ̆e 2 MeV electrons during a geomagnetic storm. Observations at geosynchronous orbit revealed a somewhat unusual two-peaked enhancement in relativistic electron fluxes [Reeves et al., 1998]. In the heart of the radiation belts at L ≈ 4, however, there was a single enhancement followed by a gradual decay. Radial profiles from the POLAR and GPS satellites revealed three distinct phases. (1) In the acceleration phase electron fluxes increased simultaneously at L ≈ 4 – 6. (2) During the passage of the cloud the radiation belts were shifted radially outward and then relaxed earthward. (3) For several days after the passage of the cloud the radial gradient of the <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattened,</b> increasing the <b>fluxes</b> at higher L-shells. These observations provide evidence that the acceleration of relativistic electrons takes place within the radiation belts and is rapid. Both magnetospheric compression and radial diffusion can cause a redistribution of electron fluxes within the magnetosphere that make the event profiles appear quite different when viewed at different L-shells...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete theoretical framework for plasma turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic {{expansion in the}} ratio of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order in this expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattening</b> gradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation. Comment: 113 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on recent {{advances}} made in global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and other microinstabilities. The nonlinear development and saturation of ITG modes and the role of E × B zonal flows are studied with a global nonlinear δf formulation that retains parallel nonlinearity and thus allows for a check of the energy conservation property as a means of verifying the quality of the numerical simulation. Due to an optimized loading technique, the conservation property is satisfied with an unprecedented quality well into the nonlinear stage. The zonal component of the perturbation evolves to a quasi-steady state with regions of ITG suppression, strongly reduced radial energy flux and steepened effective temperature profiles alternating with regions of higher ITG mode amplitudes, larger radial energy <b>flux</b> and <b>flattened</b> effective temperature profiles. A semi-Lagrangian approach free of statistical noise is proposed as an alternative to the nonlinear δf formulation. An ASDEX-Upgrade experiment with an internal transport barrier is analysed with a global gyrokinetic code that includes trapped electron dynamics. The weakly destabilizing effect of trapped electron dynamics on ITG modes in an axisymmetric bumpy configuration modelling W 7 -X is shown in global linear simulations that retain the full electron dynamics. Finite β effects on microinstabilities are investigated with a linear global spectral electromagnetic gyrokinetic formulation. The radial global structure of electromagnetic modes shows a resonant behaviour with rational q values...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{monitoring}} the supernova remnant (SNR) 1987 A with Chandra observations since 1999. Here {{we report on}} the latest change in the soft X-ray light curve of SNR 1987 A. For the last ~ 1. 5 yr (since day ~ 8000), the soft X-ray <b>flux</b> has significantly <b>flattened,</b> staying (within uncertainties) at f[subscript X] ~ 5. 7 × 10 [superscript – 12] erg cm[superscript – 2] s[superscript – 1](corresponding to L[subscript X] ~ 3. 6 × 10 [superscript 36] erg s[superscript – 1]) in the 0. 5 - 2 keV band. This remarkable change in the recent soft X-ray light curve suggests that the forward shock is now interacting with a decreasing density structure, after interacting with an increasing density gradient over ~ 10 yr prior to day ~ 8000. Possibilities may include the case that the shock is now propagating beyond a density peak of the inner ring. We briefly discuss some possible implications {{on the nature of the}} progenitor and the future prospects of our Chandra monitoring observations.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{what is our}} {{actual knowledge}} about sensors, used in the harsh environment of spray booths, to improve the reproducibility and reliability of coatings sprayed with hot or cold gases. First are described, with their limitations and precisions, the different sensors following the in-flight hot particle parameters (trajectories, temperatures, velocities, sizes, and shapes). A few comments are also made about techniques, still under developments in laboratories, to improve our understanding of coating formation such as plasma jet temperature measurements in non-symmetrical conditions, hot gases heat <b>flux,</b> particles <b>flattening</b> and splats formation, particles evaporation. Then are described the illumination techniques by laser flash of either cold particles (those injected in hot gases, or in cold spray gun) or liquid injected into hot gases (suspensions or solutions). The possibilities they open to determine the flux and velocities of cold particles or visualize liquid penetration {{in the core of}} hot gases are discussed. Afterwards are presented sensors to follow, when spraying hot particles, substrate and coating temperature evolution, and the stress development within coatings during the spray process as well as the coating thickness. The different uses of these sensors are then described with successively: (i) Measurements limited to particle trajectories, velocities, temperatures, and sizes in different spray conditions: plasma (including transient conditions due to arc root fluctuations in d. c. plasma jets), HVOF, wire arc, cold spray. Afterwards are discussed how such sensor data can be used to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} different spray processes, compare experiments to calculations and improve the reproducibility and reliability of the spray conditions. (ii) Coatings monitoring through in-flight measurements coupled with those devoted to coatings formation. This is achieved by either maintaining at their set point both in-flight and certain spray parameters (spray pattern, coating temperature [...] .), or defining a good working area through factorial design, or using artificial intelligence based on artificial neural network (ANN) to predict particle in-flight characteristics and coating structural attributes from the knowledge of processing parameters...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the first XMM-Newton {{observation}} of the highly X-ray variable, radio-quiet, Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224 - 3809 obtained during the guaranteed time programme with a 64 ks exposure. The most remarkable spectral feature is a sharp drop, by a factor ~ 5, in the spectrum at 8 keV. This is a similar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1 H 0707 - 495. Significant flattening of the hard X-ray spectrum occurs when the source <b>flux</b> decreases. The <b>flattening</b> of the spectrum can be modelled as {{an increase in the}} column density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. Below ~ 1. 5 keV the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft X-ray excess, and at around ~ 1. 2 keV there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably due to ionized Fe L absorption. The new X-ray spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton in IRAS 13224 - 3809 support a partial covering interpretation, i. e. the presence of dense material inside the accretion-disc region partially obscuring the emission from the accretion disc. However, the sharpness of the feature, if due to photoelectric absorption, is surprising and may require an alternative explanation. One possibility which does fit the whole spectrum is that it is dominated by ionized reflection rather than absorption. The unusual spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies increase the known spectral complexity of active galactic nuclei and should further stimulate a combined theoretical and observational effort to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} physics of the innermost regions of AGN.
