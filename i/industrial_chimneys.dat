25|$|Romans used tubes {{inside the}} walls to draw smoke out of {{bakeries}} but chimneys only appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. The earliest extant example of an English chimney is at the keep of Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, which dates from 1185 AD. However, they did not become common in houses until the 16th and 17th centuries. Smoke hoods were an early method of collecting the smoke into a chimney (see image). Another step {{in the development of}} chimneys was the use of built in ovens which allowed the household to bake at home. <b>Industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> became common in the late 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{is now part}} of Todmorden's history, not its present. The <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> have largely gone and the remaining mills have mostly been converted for other purposes. The town's industrial base is much reduced (at one time Todmorden had the largest weaving shed in the world). There has {{been a great deal of}} regeneration activity and Todmorden is now increasingly a commuter town for people working in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and smaller towns. Todmorden also services the local rural area and attracts visitors through its market (indoor and outdoor), various events, heritage and the local Pennine countryside. Changing work patterns may have influenced the fact that the town was the first rural telephone exchange in Britain to be broadband-enabled through public demand. Rising house prices over recent years are a particular problem as there is limited land available in the valley for building affordable housing. It has for centuries been considered the safest accessible route directly across the Pennines.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 December 1952, an {{anticyclone}} {{settled over}} a windless London, causing a temperature inversion with cold, stagnant air trapped under a layer (or [...] "lid") of warm air. The resultant fog, mixed with smoke {{from home and}} <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys,</b> particulates such as those from motor vehicle exhausts, and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, formed a persistent smog, which blanketed the capital the following day. The presence of tarry particles of soot gave the smog its yellow-black colour, hence the nickname [...] "pea-souper". The absence of significant wind prevented its dispersal and allowed an unprecedented accumulation of pollutants.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> {{were built}} in the mid-17th century when it was first {{understood}} how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the draft of air into the combustion zone.

Most 18th-century <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> (now commonly referred to as flue gas stacks) {{were built in}}to the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney.

5000|$|The {{powerful}} {{association between}} <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes {{of the industrial}} revolution {{was due to the}} universal application of the steam engine for most manufacturing processes.

The chimneys of Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing <b>industrial</b> <b>chimneys</b> that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with James Watt’s [...] "double-powered" [...] engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>chimney</b> inspection using autonomous helicopters. The importance of using these platforms {{is evidenced by the}} maintenance cost and risk reduction stemming from the replacement of the standard procedures and the improved detection of structural defects. The approach presented relies on the definition of a trajectory-dependent error space to express the dynamic model of the vehicle, and adopts a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) representation with piecewise affine dependence on the parameters to model the error dynamics over a set of predefined operating regions. The synthesis problem is stated as a continuous-time H 2 control problem, solved using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and implemented within the scope of gain-scheduling control theory. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is assessed in simulation using the full nonlinear model of a small-scale helicopter...|$|R
