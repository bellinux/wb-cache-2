5000|$|Historically, <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Ministers</b> Yitzhak Rabin, <b>Ehud</b> Barak, and Ehud Olmert each {{stated that}} {{they were willing to}} {{exchange}} the Golan for peace with Syria. Later, in 2010, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman told Syria to abandon its [...] "dreams" [...] of recovering the Golan Heights. Approximately 10% of Syrian Golan Druze have accepted Israeli citizenship.

25|$|In April 2008, President Assad told a Qatari {{newspaper}} that Syria and Israel had been discussing {{a peace treaty}} for a year, with Turkey acting as a mediator. This was confirmed in May 2008 by a spokesman for <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert. The status of the Golan Heights, a major obstacle to a peace treaty, was being discussed.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, while Israel and North African states slowly started {{diplomatic}} relations, Algeria remained one of {{the last}} countries to consider such a move.

5000|$|The term [...] "Jewish state" [...] {{has been}} in common usage in the media since the {{establishment}} of Israel, and the term was used interchangeably with Israel. George W. Bush used the term in his speeches and in an exchange of letters with <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Ariel Sharon in 2004. Barack Obama has also used the phrase, for instance {{in a speech in}} September 2010 to the U.N. General Assembly. The <b>Israeli</b> government of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a [...] "Jewish state" [...] a precondition in the peace negotiations, as has the government of his successor Benjamin Netanyahu. However, Palestinians regard a [...] "Jewish state" [...] as a trap, a new demand that did not come up during years of negotiations in the 1990s or in peace treaties reached with Egypt and Jordan. The Palestine Liberation Organization recognized the State of Israel as part of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Palestinians regard acceptance of the demand as giving up the right of return.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Israeli</b> Government - <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert {{expressed}} regret {{over the}} killings and offered humanitarian {{assistance to the}} wounded. In his address to the UN Security Council, Israel's deputy UN representative Daniel Carmon reiterated Israel's [...] "deep sorrow and regret" [...] over the accidental killing of innocent civilians, and told the council that terrorism by Hamas was to blame for [...] "the incident in Beit Hanoun". [...] "If Palestinian terror did not continue to assault Israelis, if Qassam rockets stopped sailing out of Gaza into Israel, the incident in Beit Hanoun would never have happened," [...] Carmon said. [...] "A single decision is needed: The Palestinian Authority government must decide to stop using terrorism {{as a means to}} achieving its goals." [...] At a business conference in Tel Aviv, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Olmert said, [...] "I am very uncomfortable with this event. I'm very distressed." [...] Olmert called it a [...] "mistake" [...] caused by [...] "technical failure," [...] and he urged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to meet with him immediately. Israeli organizations, including Peace Now and Gush Shalom and political parties Meretz and Hadash held a protest in Tel Aviv shortly after news of the killings broke. Israeli human rights group B'Tselem described the policy of returning fire to the general area from which a rocket attack is launched a [...] "war crime." ...|$|R
2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. <b>Israeli</b> former <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I see no reason to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward." [...] Australian <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|R
25|$|Operation Summer Rains, which {{failed to}} achieve its main {{objective}} (the release of Shalit), ended on 26 November 2006 when the <b>Israeli</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on a cease-fire, after the Palestinian militancy organizations agreed to stop firing rockets on Sderot and after Israel agreed to cease IDF operations in the Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|French President Jacques Chirac castigated the Israeli {{offensive}} into Lebanon on 14 July.

25|$|At an {{emergency}} {{meeting of the}} Arab League in Beirut, the Siniora Plan was further detailed, by specifying that 15,000 Lebanese Army troops would fill the void in southern Lebanon between an Israeli withdrawal {{and the arrival of}} the international force.

2500|$|During {{the course}} of negotiations, Netanyahu {{followed}} the precedent of Israel's former <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert and made recognition of Israel as a Jewish state a requirement for peace.

Urging Abbas to recognize Israel as the Jewish-nation state, he reportedly said: ...|$|R
5000|$|For example, in 2006 when <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Ariel Sharon had {{a severe}} stroke, Deputy <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert assumed {{power on the}} basis that he was [...] "acting for" [...] the {{incapacitated}} Sharon.

25|$|At a {{court hearing}} on 27 January, the Israeli {{government}} promised to resume supplies of fuel, but not at normal levels, for another week.

2500|$|At the Taba summit (at Taba) in January 2001 talks {{continued}} {{based on}} the Clinton Parameters. The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map. The proposition removed the [...] "temporarily Israeli controlled" [...] areas from the West Bank, and the Palestinian side accepted this {{as a basis for}} further negotiation. However, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Barak did not conduct further negotiations at that time; the talks ended without an agreement and the following month the right-wing Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon was elected as <b>Israeli</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> in February 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Amir {{was later}} sentenced to an {{additional}} five years, and after an appeal {{on behalf of}} the state, eight years, for conspiring to commit the assassination with his brother Hagai Amir and Dror Adani. All of the sentences were cumulative. In Israel, a sentence of life imprisonment is usually reduced to a period of 20-30 years by the president, with the possibility of further reduction for good behavior. However, President Moshe Katsav did not reduce the sentence, saying that there is [...] "no forgiveness, no absolution, and no pardon" [...] for Yigal Amir. Present <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Benyamin Netanyahu and former <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert have also said that Yigal Amir will never be released from prison.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the attack, <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> Olmert called Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, explained the situation, {{and asked him}} to relay a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that Israel would not tolerate another nuclear plant, but that no further action was planned. Olmert said that Israel did not want to play up the incident and was still interested in peace with Syria, adding that if Assad chose not {{to draw attention to the}} incident, he would do likewise.|$|E
25|$|On 24 January, the United Nations Human Rights Council {{condemned}} Israel for {{the fifteenth}} time {{in less than}} two years, calling the blockade collective punishment.
