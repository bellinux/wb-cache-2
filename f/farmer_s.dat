40|$|We {{consider}} {{the implications of}} trends {{in the number of}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> and food imports on the question of what role U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> have in an increasingly global agrifood system. Our discussion stems from the argument some scholars have made that American consumers can import their food more cheaply from other countries than it can produce it. We {{consider the}} distinction between U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> and agriculture and the effect of the U. S. food footprint on developing nations to argue there might be an important role for U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers,</b> even if it appears Americans don’t need them. For instance, we may need to protect U. S. farmland and, by implication, U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers,</b> for future food security needs both domestic and international. We also explore the role of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> by considering the question of whether food is a privilege or a right. Although Americans seem to accept that food is a privilege, many scholars and commentators argue that, at least on a global scale, food is a right, particularly for the world’s poor and hungry. If this is the case, then U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> might have a role in meeting the associated obligation to ensure that the poor of the world have enough food to eat. We look at the consequences of determining that food is a right versus a privilege and the implications of that decision for agricultural subsidies as well as U.

It is the best-known, {{but by no means}} only, service provided by the Cameroon-based NGO Service d appui aux initiatives locales de développement (SAILD; Support service for local development initiatives). SAILD also has a high reputation for its useful technical handbooks, its reliable question-and-answer service and its wide range of field support activities with farmers groups across the country, from disseminating market price information to establishing tree nurseries. The monthly newspaper is now in its 15 th year of publication. With its rich content of informative articles on all aspects of agriculture and rural life, not only has it become a household name amongst farmers and farmers organisations in Cameroon and neighbouring countries, but it has also won the respect of development organisations and agricultural media professionals worldwide. Its straightforward tone, resolute and no-nonsense, often takes bureaucracies of whatever level or sector to task if their activities are {{getting in the way of}} farmers getting on with their lives. Over the years, not a few extension services, price boards and input suppliers have been encouraged by The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice to improve their service. But it is not only a campaigning force; each issue is stuffed with practical tips for the field and the workshop, with guidelines for drawing up business plans or marketing strategies, even at the most modest level, as well as a lively readers section, background articles and dossiers, profiles of plants, animals and organisations, book reviews and more. Until August 2002, The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice was available only in print, in several editions the French edition for Cameroon and Chad (circulation 20, 000), the English edition, read mainly in Cameroon (6, 000) and the two Arabic editions for Chad and the western Sahel region (5, 000 and 10, 000, respectively). The high quality of the Website edition attests to the dedication and skill of the editorial team. It has embarked not just on publishing the latest edition online, but also on opening up the archives of earlier issues. At the moment the French edition of the newspaper, La Voix du Paysan, is online (www. lavoixdupaysan. net). Work is underway to put the English edition online too, and it will be announced soon in Spore. Everything on the site is accessible free-of-charge and is clearly presented in thematic sections, with a large choice of articles just a click away. Even SAILD s famous cartoons have been included.

MMM Leena Rantamäki-Lahtisen tekemässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin suomalaisen viljelijän eläketurvan tasoa ja sitä, mitä voimassa oleva eläketurva hänelle maksaa. Tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin viljelijän eläketurvan ja eläkemaksujen tasoa verrattuna tilalta saatuihin tuloihin. Tulojen vertailu perustuu kirjanpitotiloista tuotantosuunnittain muodostettuihin tilamalleihin. Lisäksi tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin nykyarvomenetelmän avulla eri suuruisten MYEL-työtulotasojen mukaisten eläkemaksujen ja kokonaiseläkkeiden välisiä suhteita sekä verrattiin lakisääteisen eläkevakuutuksen kustannuksia vastaavaan yksilölliseen eläkevakuutukseen. MYEL-työtulotaso vaikutti siihen, kuinka hyvin laskennallinen MYEL-työtulo ja tilasta saadut tulot vastasivat toisiaan. Viljatilalla saadut tulot ylsivät vain puoleen MYEL-normaalityötulosta, sikatilalla tulot jäivät hieman MYEL-työtuloputken alalaidan alle ja maitotilalla tilasta saadut tulot vastasivat normaalityötuloa. Maksujen ja kokonaiseläkkeiden välinen suhde oli viljelijälle edullisin alimmilla MYEL-työtulotasoilla, sitä vastoin maksujen ja kokonaiseläkkeiden välisen erotuksen nykyarvot olivat suurimmat korkeammilla työtulotasoilla. Tutkimuksen perusteella voidaan todeta, että viljelijöiden eläkeiän tulotaso on turvattu ja riittävä verrattuna nykyiseen tulotasoon. Mikäli viljelijä haluaa kasvattaa saamaansa eläkettä, yksilöllinen eläkevakuutus on kuitenkin edullisempi vaihtoehto kuin lakisääteinen eläkevakuutus. Viljelijän kannattaa maksaa työtuloputken alalaidan mukaisia eläkemaksuja ja hankkia korkeampien MYEL-työtulojen mukainen eläketurva yksilöllisellä eläkevakuutuksella. Finland has {{a public}} pension {{program that is}} divided into two {{separate}} parts. The first part consists of earnings-related pensions, in which people contribute to the system during their working life in exchange of earnings-related benefits after retirement. The second part consists of basic pensions for all Finnish citizens. The amount of basic pension depends on the amount of earnings-related pension, basic pension reduces as earnings-related pension increases. Farmers have their own earnings-related pension program, where they pay fees during their active farming years and receive benefits after retirement. This study analyses economic prospects of farmers retirement program (MYEL) in Finland under alternative payment schemes and retirement ages. The study has two major goals. The first is to find out how much farmers income will change after retirement and how much retirement plan will cost them compared to its expected benefits. The second is to figure out how competitive the public retirement plan is compared to a private insurance that can be, within certain limits, substituted for the public program. The comparison is made from the <b>farmer</b> <b>s</b> perspective. Expected benefits and losses of the alternative retirement slays were compared using the representative farm approach. The representative farm was defined for three different farms: dairy farm, hog farm and grain farm. These farms were computed from the results 1995 of bookkeeping farms in Southern-Finland. In the first part <b>farmer</b> <b>s</b> labour income was compared to his/her MYEL-income. The expected present value of the earnings-related insurance fees was compared to the expected present value of pensions (both earnings-related and basic pensions combined). The present value technique was also used for the comparison between the private pensions and public programs. The MYEL income is a computational income defined by farmers pension program. It is based on the farms arable land and forest area. Farmers can quite freely define the MYEL income of their farms within certain limits. The MYEL income influences the fees and later to the amount of the earnings-related pension. On the other hand, the production line has great effect on the farm s labour income. Hence, the possible fall in <b>farmer</b> <b>s</b> income is largely determined by the individual choice of the MYEL income level. For this reason three different MYEL income levels were defined for each different representative farm. These MYEL income levels were the lowest possible one, "normal" and the highest possible one. On the dairy farm the "normal" on-farm MYEL income was equal to labour income. On the hog farm the lowest MYEL income was higher than labour income, but the discrepancy was not substantial. On the farm, that produced grain only the normal MYEL income was twice as large as on-farm labour income. Therefore, as the monthly amount of pension depends on the MYEL income, the <b>farmer</b> <b>s</b> standard of living does not fall significantly after retirement. The discount rate and MYEL income level affects the relative value of the fees and expected values of pensions. As expected, increasing discount rate reduces significantly the expected Net Present Value (NPV) of the pension scheme. The discount rate on which the NPV will turn negative depends on the MYEL-income level: on the higher level it will turn to negative at lower interest rates. In the basic-model, where it was assumed that farmer pays fees for 37 years, retires at the age of 65 and expected NPV of pensions is calculated until the age of 88, the NPV turned negative at interest rates from 4 to 9 %. In the basic-model the farmer was entitled for full earnings-related pension (60 % of the active-time s income). The significance of not achieving the full earnings-related pension was measured by the sensitivity analysis. The result of the analysis was that increased basic pension compensated quite well for the deficiency of full earnings-related pension: the amount of pension fell only from 2 to 12 %, (pensions were from 45 to 55 % of the active time s income). The results suggest that the most beneficial method to gain pension which is equal to pension received from normal or the highest possible MYEL income is to combine the public and private programs. Thus, the largest expected NPV can be achieved by purchasing the lowest possible insurance level through the public program and then increasing the pension by the private insurance. vokMTT TaloustutkimusThe economic prospects of farmer's retirement program in Finlan...|$|E

The excessive utilization of natural resource bases and changing climate are leading to the negative yield trend and plateauing of Rice-wheat (RW) system productivity. The conservation agriculture based efficient and environmental friendly alternative tillage and crop establishment practices have been adopted by the farmers on large scale. A few tools have been evolved to simulate the different tillage and crop establishment. In the present study, InfoRCT (Information on Use of Resource Conserving Technologies), a excel based model integrating biophysical, agronomic, and socioeconomic data to establish input-output relationships related to water, fertilizer, labor, and biocide uses; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; biocide residue in soil; and Nitrogen (N) fluxes in the rice-wheat system has been validated for farmer participatory practices.
