5|$|During a {{temporary}} physical <b>infirmity</b> or an {{absence from the}} kingdom, the sovereign may temporarily delegate some {{of his or her}} functions to Counsellors of State, the monarch's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession. The present Counsellors of State are: the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry and the Duke of York.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no <b>infirmity</b> when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} President falls vacant upon the expiry of the incumbent's six-year term {{or if the}} President is for some reason unable to {{complete}} his or her term; for example, due to death, resignation or removal from office for misconduct or mental or physical <b>infirmity.</b> If the office of President becomes vacant before the incumbent's term expires, a poll for an election must be held within six months. In other cases, an election can take place any time from {{three months before the}} expiry of the incumbent's term of office.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} <b>infirmity,</b> {{which might have}} been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age of}} 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E
5|$|When Heffron's former {{opponent}} Arthur {{resigned from}} the ministry on 23 February 1953 when a Royal Commission {{was set up to}} investigate his involvement in corrupt business activity, Heffron was commissioned to replace him as Secretary for Mines, serving from February to September 1953. As Deputy Premier, Heffron acted in Cahill's absence and in times of <b>infirmity,</b> which included receiving the Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, on his arrival at Sydney Airport on 31 October 1957, the first visit of a Prime Minister of Japan to Australia. Heffron's role as deputy became of prime importance when Cahill died suddenly in October 1959, and the 68-year-old Heffron was elected to succeed him unopposed.|$|E
5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The <b>infirmity</b> theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E

25|$|Pilgrimage was {{undertaken}} to local, {{national and international}} shrines for personal devotion, as penance imposed by a priest, or to seek cures for illness or <b>infirmity.</b> Written sources and pilgrim badges found in Scotland, of clay, jet and pewter, indicate journeys undertaken to Scottish shrines and further afield. The most visited pilgrimage sites in late medieval Christendom were Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela, in Spain, but Scottish pilgrims also visited Amiens in France and Canterbury in England.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} if these {{elections}} were {{a response to}} Charles's East Frankish deposition or to his death. Only those of Arnulf and Berengar can be certainly placed before his death. Only the magnates of the East ever formally deposed him. He was buried with honour in Reichenau after his death and the Annales Fuldenses heap praises on his piety and godliness. Indeed, contemporary opinion of Charles is consistently kinder than later historiography, {{though it is a}} modern suggestion that his lack of apparent successes is the excusable result of near constant illness and <b>infirmity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Gordon Wenham of Trinity College, Bristol, {{noted that}} the {{sacrificial}} system regularly associates sacrifices with cleansing and sanctification. Wenham read Leviticus to teach that sacrificial blood was necessary to cleanse and sanctify. Sacrifice could undo the effects of sin and human <b>infirmity.</b> Sin and disease profaned the holy and polluted the clean, whereas sacrifice could reverse this process. Wenham illustrated with the chart at right. Wenham concluded that contact between the holy and the unclean resulted in death. Sacrifice, by cleansing the unclean, made such contact possible. Sacrifice thus allowed the holy God to meet with sinful man.|$|E
