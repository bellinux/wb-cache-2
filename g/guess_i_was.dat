500|$|In 1992, Eastwood {{acknowledged}} to writer David Breskin that his political views represented {{a fusion of}} Milton Friedman and Noam Chomsky and suggested that they would make for a worthwhile presidential ticket. In 1999, Eastwood stated, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a social liberal and fiscal conservative before it became fashionable." [...] Ten years later, in 2009, Eastwood {{said that he was}} now a registered Libertarian.|$|E
500|$|Grigorieva {{had signed}} with Gibson's music label {{prior to the}} album's release. The music project {{was made by the}} film {{production}} company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. So, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drawn to that notion for the album title." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} the LP received {{at the time}} of its release, the remastered CD issued 21 years later was generally well received. In the 2004 Recommended Records catalogue, Cutler wrote that the album had [...] "raised eyebrows at the time (from, as Fred calls them 'progressive music snobs'—of which I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one) for its apparent simplicity and departure from what was then thought of as Fred Style." [...] René van Peer of Leonardo Digital Reviews admitted in 2005 that he was [...] "one of those snobs" [...] and wrote [...] "I am astonished and embarrassed to find how little I grasped back then of what Frith had put into it." [...] Looking at Frith's projects after Cheap at Half the Price made it clear that what he did on the album was not a departure from his musical experiments, as people saw it at the time, but rather a part of it. Van Peer said (in retrospect) that Cheap at Half the Price [...] "bursts with inventiveness, and eradiates [...] the irrepressible joy of playful creativity".|$|E
500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|In {{a notable}} {{contemporary}} act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that {{ultimately lead to}} her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria {{that led to his}} execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (Markings). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent." [...] Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war. In 1963 Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc performed a famous act of self-immolation to protest against alleged persecution of his faith by the Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem regime.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and {{speaking}} rather contemptuously, {{as if he}} <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{beats me}} too, Simcoe. As you may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always most {{cautious}} about it, and always {{take a very}} roundabout way {{of going to the}} station." ...|$|R

500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E
500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{testing the}} waters {{to see if}} I would live through it", DeVille told another interviewer. [...] "It was a foolish, foolish thing to do."

2500|$|Eisner in 2005 {{recalled}} his studio as [...] "a friendly shop, and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the same age}} as the youngest guys there. We all got along. The only ones who ever got into a hassle were George Tuska and Bob Powell. Powell was kind of a wiseguy and made remarks about other people in the shop. One day, George had enough of it, got up, and punched out Bob Powell". Eisner on another occasion said his partnership with Everett M. [...] "Busy" [...] Arnold created tensions when Arnold wanted to hire Powell separately: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pederick had {{confessed to}} the bombing and so was convicted without {{detailed}} scrutiny of his confession. However, in the Anderson appeal, Chief Justice Gleeson said Pederick's account of the bombing was [...] "clearly unreliable". Pederick's later appeal was rejected when he produced no evidence to explain why his original confession had been false. Pederick was released after serving eight years in jail and stated: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can keep}} {{on the tracks}} all right," [...] she assented. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little easier to deal with, for instance, than your friend Mr. Jocelyn Thew." ...|$|R

2500|$|Mara was {{inspired}} to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like Gone with the Wind (1939), Rebecca (1940), and Bringing Up Baby (1938), with her mother. [...] She also {{wanted to be like}} her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Mara resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to The Journal News that [...] "it never seemed that honorable to me, and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always afraid that I might fail." [...] Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend. [...] Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting, first auditioning at the age of nineteen.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 she {{produced}} a {{show at the}} Boesky Gallery featuring elderly women posed in ornate costumes and wigs. She painted them in oils on ovals of glass and had them photographed. Her inspiration for the set of pieces was Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. She told an interview that being pregnant at the time, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about mortality, feminine beauty, my fears about being a mother and an artist." [...] An ArtForum reviewer noted that the costume and pose of one drawing was a [...] "nearly identical copy" [...] of a Feinstein photograph in a Marc Jacobs advertisement {{from the year before}} and that the elderly model in fact looked much like Ms. Feinstein might look when she aged. The reviewer wrote the [...] "(self-)portraits" [...] felt [...] "in line with the current vogue for noble iconography" [...] and also described them as [...] "celebratory caricatures, self-indulgent and vain." [...] She also criticized the one foam and three wood sculptures from the exhibition as [...] "merely clunky hybrids of kitschy Cubism and craft." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I <b>guess</b> (<b>I</b> <b>was)</b> more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jefferson laughed. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{or these}} brutes wouldn't {{try to take}} {{advantage}} of me. Still, in another minute you're going to see me make a hole in somebody!" ...|$|R
