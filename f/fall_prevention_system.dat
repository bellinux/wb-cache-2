40|$|Falls {{and their}} {{consequences}} are arguably most important events for transition from independent living to institutional care for older adults. Information and communication technology (ICT) -based support of fall prevention and fall risk assessment {{under the control}} of the user has a tremendous potential to, over time, prevent falls and reduce associated harm and costs. Our research uses participative design and a persuasive health approach to allow for seamless integration of an ICT-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>system</b> into older adults’ everyday life. Based on a 6 -month field study with 12 participants, we present qualitative results regarding the system use and provide insights into attitudes and practices of older adults concerning fall prevention and ICT-supported self-management of health. Our study demonstrates how it can lead to positive aspects of embodiment and health literacy through continuous monitoring of personal results, improved technical confidence, and quality of life.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, an ever {{increasing}} range of technology-based applications {{have been developed}} {{with the goal of}} assisting in the delivery of more effective and efficient <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions. Whilst {{there have been a number}} of studies that have surveyed technologies for a particular sub-domain of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention,</b> there is no existing research which surveys the full spectrum of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions and characterises the range of technologies that have augmented this landscape. This study presents a conceptual framework and survey of the state of the art of technology-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> which is derived from a systematic template analysis of studies presented in contemporary research literature. The framework proposes four broad categories of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> intervention system: Pre-fall prevention; Post-fall prevention; Fall injury prevention; Cross-fall prevention. Other categories include, Application type, Technology deployment platform, Information sources, Deployment environment, User interface type, and Collaborative function. After presenting the conceptual framework, a detailed survey of the state of the art is presented as a function of the proposed framework. A number of research challenges emerge as a result of surveying the research literature, which include a need for: new systems that focus on overcoming extrinsic falls risk factors; systems that support the environmental risk assessment process; systems that enable patients and practitioners to develop more collaborative relationships and engage in shared decision making during falls risk assessment and prevention activities. In response to these challenges, recommendations and future research directions are proposed to overcome each respective challenge...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} a greater prevalence of spin turns, which are more unstable than step turns, in older adults compared to young adults in laboratory settings. Currently, turning strategies can only be identified through visual observation, either in-person or through video. This paper presents two unique methods and their combination to remotely monitor turning behavior using three uniaxial gyroscopes. Five young adults performed 90 ° turns at slow, normal, and fast walking speeds around a variety of obstacles while instrumented with three IMUs (attached on the trunk, left and right shank). Raw data from 360 trials were analyzed. Compared to visual classification, the two IMU methods’ sensitivity/specificity to detecting spin turns were 76. 1 %/ 76. 7 % and 76. 1 %/ 84. 4 %, respectively. When the two methods were combined, the IMU had an overall 86. 8 % sensitivity and 92. 2 % specificity, with 89. 4 %/ 100 % sensitivity/specificity at slow speeds. This combined method can be implemented into wireless <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> and used to identify increased use of spin turns. This method allows for longitudinal monitoring of turning strategies and allows researchers to test for potential associations between the frequency of spin turns and clinically relevant outcomes (e. g., falls) in non-laboratory settings...|$|R
40|$|On April 19, 2012, a 37 -year-old Hispanic male laborer fell {{approximately}} 13. 5 {{feet from}} a residential roof to a concrete driveway; he died immediately from his injuries. The laborer {{was working with}} a crew of eight Hispanic workers for a construction subcontractor replacing shingles on a roof accessed by a ladder. At {{the time of the}} incident, five workers were on the roof, including the laborer who was out of sight of his coworkers working on the garage side of the home. When the incident occurred, the co-workers heard the laborer hit the ground, rushed to his aid, and called 911. Emergency Medical Services were dispatched to the incident and the laborer was pronounced dead at the scene. Key contributing factors identified in this investigation include: 1. 13 -foot plus fall distance and concrete surface; 2. 10 / 12 roof pitch; 3. 25 -foot working length of fall arrest system lifeline; 4. Fall arrest system lanyard connection point; 5. Fall arrest system anchorage method; 6. Worker's level of experience / lack of training. NIOSH investigators concluded that, to help prevent similar occurrences, employers should: 1. Develop, implement, and enforce a comprehensive, safety program; 2. Ensure that all employees working at heights are provided with <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> training that complies with OSHA standards, in a language and at a literacy level that they can comprehend; 3. Ensure that all employees are provided with properly assembled and maintained fall protection systems when exposed to fall hazards; 4.

40|$|Background: Falls {{are common}} in older adults and can result in serious injuries. Due to {{demographic}} changes, falls and related healthcare costs are likely to increase over the next years. Participation and motivation of older adults in <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> measures remain a challenge. The iStoppFalls project developed an information and communication technology (ICT) -based system for older adults to use at home {{in order to reduce}} common fall risk factors such as impaired balance and muscle weakness. The system aims at increasing older adults’ motivation to participate in ICT-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> measures. This article reports on usability, user-experience and user-acceptance aspects affecting the use of the iStoppFalls system by older adults. Methods: In the course of a 16 -week international multicenter study, 153 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 + participated in the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial, of which half used the system in their home to exercise and assess their risk of falling. During the study, 60 participants completed questionnaires regarding the usability, user experience and user acceptance of the iStoppFalls system. Usability was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). For user experience the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was applied. User acceptance was assessed with the Dynamic Acceptance Model for the Re-evaluation of Technologies (DART). To collect more detailed data on usability, user experience and user acceptance, additional qualitative interviews and observations were conducted with participants. Results: Participants evaluated the usability of the system with an overall score of 62 (Standard Deviation, SD 15. 58) out of 100, which suggests good usability. Most users enjoyed the iStoppFalls games and assessments, as shown by the overall PACES score of 31 (SD 8. 03). With a score of 0. 87 (SD 0. 26), user acceptance results showed that participants accepted the iStoppFalls system for use in their own home. Interview data suggested that certain factors such as motivation, complexity or graphical design were different for gender and age. Conclusions: The results suggest that the iStoppFalls system has good usability, user experience and user acceptance. It will be important to take these along with factors such as motivation, gender and age into consideration when designing and further developing ICT-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fall {{prediction}} is a multifaceted problem that involves complex interactions between physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Existing fall detection and prediction systems mainly focus on physiological {{factors such as}} gait, vision, and cognition, and do not address the multifactorial nature of falls.

This paper summarises the state of science regarding STFL, outlining relevant aspects of epidemiology, biomechanics, psychophysics, tribology, organisational influences, and injury prevention. This review reaffirms that STFL remain a major cause of workplace injury and STFL prevention is a complex problem, requiring multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted approaches. Despite progress in recent decades in understanding the mechanisms involved in STFL, especially slipping, research leading to evidence-based prevention practices remains insufficient, given the problem scale. It is concluded that there is a pressing need to develop better <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies using <b>systems</b> approaches conceptualising and addressing the factors involved in STFL, with considerations of the full range of factors and their interactions.

40|$|Abstract- It is {{of little}} {{surprise}} that falling is often accepted as {{a natural part of}} the aging process. In fact, it is the impact rather than the occurrence of falls in the elderly, which is of most concern. Aging people are typically frailer, more unsteady, and have slower reactions, thus are more likely to fall and be injured than younger individuals. Typically, research and industry presented various practical solutions for assisting the elderly and their caregivers against falls via detecting falls and triggering notification alarms calling for help as soon as falls occur in order to diminish fall consequences. Furthermore, fall likelihood prediction systems have been emerged lately based on the manipulation of the medical and behavioral history of elderly patients in order to predict the possibility of falls occurrence. Accordingly, response from caregivers may be triggered prior to most fall occurrences and accordingly prevent falls from taking place.

40|$|Older {{adults are}} not optimally engaged in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. Peer {{education}} {{may be an}} approach to improving engagement and uptake of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies by community-dwelling older adults. However, empirical research regarding this approach has been inconclusive. Accordingly, the primary aim {{of this research was}} to design a peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education program and evaluate its impact on community-dwelling older adults’ beliefs, knowledge, motivation, and intention to engage in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. This research was a mixed methods study conducted in two phases. Phase 1 comprised three concurrent studies. These aimed to elucidate the issues regarding <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education and information from key stakeholders and to inform the research in Phase 2. The aims of Phase 1 were, first; to seek key stakeholders’ perspectives in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the role of peer educators in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> second; to garner views about community-dwelling older adults’ preferences for seeking and receiving <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> information, and third; to seek expert evaluation and opinion about the peer educators’ presentations of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education for community-dwelling older adults. Feedback from peer educators and expert reviewers indicated that peer education was a feasible and potentially effective approach to deliver education about <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> but that the education should be presented in a personalised manner and incorporate adult learning principles and behaviour change theory. Older adults also suggested that practical strategies and information should be presented in a positive and respectful manner. Their prior experience of falling was found to be an important mediator to receptivity to <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> messages. Based on the findings of Phase 1, Phase 2 involved the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a new contemporary peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education program. A longitudinal quasi-experimental trial (n= 232) was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the presentation with the existing program, using a purpose-developed questionnaire. Peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education significantly increased older adults’ beliefs that <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> measures would be useful, their knowledge about <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies and intention to take measures to reduce their risk of falling. Older adults who received the contemporary program were significantly more likely to develop a clear action plan to engage in specific measures to reduce their risk of falling compared to the control group.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how staff responded to individualised patient <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education delivered as part of a cluster randomised trial, including how they perceived the education contributed to <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> on their wards. Design: A qualitative explanatory study. Methods: 5 focus groups were conducted at participatory hospital sites. The purposive sample of clinical staff (including nurses, physiotherapists and quality improvement staff) worked on aged care rehabilitation wards when a cluster randomised trial evaluating a patient education programme was conducted. During the intervention period, an educator, who was a trained health professional and not a member of staff, provided individualised <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education to patients with good levels of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination > 23 / 30). Clinical staff were provided with training to support the programme and their feedback was sought after the trial concluded, to understand how they perceived the programme impacted on <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> Data were thematically analysed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Results: 5 focus groups were conducted at different hospitals (n= 30 participants). Staff perceived that the education created a positive culture around <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> and further, facilitated teamwork, whereby patients and staff worked together to address <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> The educator was perceived to be a valuable member of the team.

40|$|Introduction: Falling {{in older}} {{age is a}} serious and costly problem. At least one in three older people fall annually. Although {{exercise}} is recognised as an effective <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> intervention, low numbers of older people engage in suitable programmes. Health and exercise professionals {{play a crucial role}} in addressing fall risk in older adults. This trial aims to evaluate the effect of participation in a <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> educational programme, compared with a wait-list control group, on health and exercise professionals' knowledge about <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> and the effect on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> exercise prescription behaviour and confidence to prescribe the exercises to older people. Methods and analysis: A randomised controlled trial involving 220 consenting health and exercise professionals will be conducted. Participants will be individually randomised to an intervention group (n= 110) to receive an educational workshop plus access to internet-based support resources, or a waitlist control group (n= 110). The two primary outcomes, measured 3 months after randomisation, are: (1) knowledge about <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> and (2) self-perceived change in <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> exercise prescription behaviour. Secondary outcomes include: (1) participants' confidence to prescribe <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> exercises; (2) the proportion of people aged 60 + years seen by trial participants in the past month who were prescribed <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> exercise; and (3) the proportion of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> exercises prescribed by participants to older people in the past month that comply with evidence-based guidelines.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between falls efficacy, perception of fall risk and <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score of fall efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception of fall risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, and <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) Fall efficacy was significantly different according to falls experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception of fall risk was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) and <b>Fall</b> <b>prevention</b> behavior was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between fall efficacy and perception of fall risk. It showed the positive relation between falls efficacy and <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> behaviors, and <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> behaviors and perception of fall risk. According to this study, it showed relation between fall efficacy, perception of fall risk and <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> behaviors.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the occupational therapy <b>fall</b> <b>preventions</b> for older people with a literature review and to assess the included studies scientific evidence value. The authors of this study chose to follow Friberg (2006) model for a literature review. A literature search was done with in advance chosen search words and search word combinations in different databases. After reading the abstracts the authors chose to include the studies that complied with the inclusion criteria’s that was selected. The studies that were included were read by both authors several times and were analyzed to assess the studies scientific evidence value and a summary of what occupational therapeutic <b>fall</b> <b>preventions</b> had been carried out. The data analysis resulted in three main categories of the interventions that were carried out in relation to Kielhofner (2008) classifications of the environment and the individual. The results show that the studies that carried out <b>fall</b> <b>preventions</b> only on the environmental level came to conclusions that the environmental level is a crucial part of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> and these studies were assessed to have a high scientific evidence value. The studies that carried out <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> on both environment and individual level all came to conclusions that it was important to look at both environmental and individual level. The studies in this category were assessed to having either medium high or low scientific evidence value. The studies that only carried out <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> on individual level came to conclusions that it is important to take into consideration the individuals’ point of view and that motivation is a crucial part to succeeding with <b>fall</b> <b>prevention.</b> All studies in this category were assessed to having low scientific evidence value. The conclusion the authors came to, in this study was that occupational therapy <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> for older people is needed on both environmental and individual level and that the participation of an occupational therapist in <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> is important for the <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> to be as effective as possible. The authors believe that further occupational therapy studies are needed in this subject, where also theoretical approaches are explored. Validerat; 20110617 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of injurious falls amongst older {{people living in the}} community is continuously portrayed as a major public health problem facing the Canadian health care system. As additional resources are allocated for community-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> programs, health service providers are increasingly expected to understand and enact <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> in effective and meaningful ways. The aim of this two-phase interpretive phenomenological study was to enhance understandings of the taken-for-granted meanings that characterize everyday practices of community-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> in order to foster more sensitive, tactful, and meaningful approaches to <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> with older people. In the first phase of this study, I engaged nine older people living independently in the community in individual phenomenological interviews to explore the meaning of the experience of anticipating falling. In the second phase of this study I engaged six health professionals working on a community outreach team in phenomenological interviews exploring the meaning of the experience of enacting <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> with older people in the community. The findings of this two-phase study overall give rise to four key insights that may inform the refinement of fall risk assessment and <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> practice for physiotherapists and other service providers. First, a phenomenological ethics of caring was central to enacting <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> for service providers in the community. Second, lived-identity was central to the experience of anticipating falling for older people. Third, meaningful risk-taking was essential to older peoples’ quality of life and enactment of their lived-identity. Finally, the meaning of anticipating falling was learned experientially through older peoples’ experience of falling or witnessing others experience falls. Understanding these key insights, service providers might seek to adopt a transformative learning approach to <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> that focuses on affirming an appreciative understanding of lived-identity, meaningful risk, and meaningful caution in older peoples’ lives. Erich Fromm’s distinction between having and being orientations to lived-identity may be used to provide insight into the enactment of such a transformative approach to <b>fall</b> <b>prevention...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a myriad}} of studies on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention,</b> patient <b>falls</b> {{continue}} to be a longterm problem experienced by health care organisations world-wide. Falls impose a heavy burden in terms of social, medical, and financial outcomes, and continue to pose a threat to patient safety. Because the potential for a fall is a constant clinical safety issue in every health care organisation, protecting the patient from falls and subsequent injuries, and ensuring that the patient care environment facilitates, are fundamental aspects in providing quality care. Moreover, the current international focus on creating a culture of quality care and patient safety requires the implementation of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> programs that decrease the risk of falls. As with other international health care organisations, the National University Hospital (where the principal investigator is working), has been challenged with the issue of how to prioritise and implement quality initiatives across all disciplines. Faced with persistent patient falls that affect care outcomes, <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> has been a priority initiative at the hospital since 2003. In response, a nursing task force was established in an attempt to resolve this problem. A root cause analysis undertaken by this task force revealed that the hospital protocol on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> was outdated and not evidence-based. Furthermore, many nurses did not understand the importance of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention,</b> while the administration of the <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> program was instituted on an ad hoc basis rather than as a standard of care for all patients. The challenge for this task force, as with other health care professionals, was not only in finding an intervention that was effective, but also identifying who would benefit from its implementation. Although the need to apply current best practices to reduce patient falls is clear from the task force results, evidence of the effectiveness of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions in acute care hospitals is lacking in literature. In addition, there are no published studies on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> in Singapore to support changes in nursing practices. Thus, it becomes apparent that research on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> is greatly needed in Singapore so that an evidence-based <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> program can be developed. This topic coincides with the Doctor of Nursing course, which requires the student to gain knowledge through scholarly research on contemporary issues in nursing by undertaking two separate projects related to a single area of interest. Undertaking the two research projects on <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> in an acute care inpatient hospital as part of the doctoral studies provided an opportunity to address this deficit in a way that could raise awareness of the importance of <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> in Singapore hospitals. This research also provides a platform for the first body of research into <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> to be conducted within the Singapore health care environment, which is essential, as international studies are not always necessarily applicable to the Singapore context due to differences in educational preparation, skills-mix, organisational culture and nursing practices.

40|$|Falls in {{hospital}} remain a significant safety concern among older patients. They {{are the most}} commonly reported adverse event {{in hospital}}s, {{and can lead to}} serious injury, morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. In 2008, over 12, 000 falls were reported in Queensland Health facilities. The Best Practice Guidelines for <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> in Australian hospitals were introduced in 2005 [3]; however, falls continue to be a daily challenge for frontline staff. Staff are a key component in preventing falls, yet little is known about their safety attitudes, knowledge and compliance with <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. A pilot 12 -month education and awareness program was conducted to improve the attitudes, engagement, uptake and adherence with best practice strategies for <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> using locally based Falls Specialist Officers to provide ongoing education and support. Project objectives: �To increase awareness of <b>falls</b> and <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> in the participating facilities �To build the capacity of frontline staff in delivering best practice <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies To improve the safety culture around <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> �To increase the organisational involvement in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> activities Methods – how we did it: Participants and setting: All frontline staff working in 11 wards at 3 south-east Queensland metropolitan hospitals – 6 acute and 5 sub-acute wards, ranging in size from 10 to 33 beds. Staffing: Two Falls Specialist Officers (FSO) were recruited to lead the project for a period of 12 -months. These officers were alliedhealth staff, recruited from within the local district. Intervention: The FSOs undertook action research cycles to identify gaps in the knowledge, skills and attitudes of frontline staff towards <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> These cycles guided {{the development and implementation of}} various program components to build the competencies of frontline staff in the <b>prevention</b> of <b>falls,</b> a...|$|R
