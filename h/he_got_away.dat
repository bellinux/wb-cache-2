5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>away,</b> but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
25|$|When he woke up, Xwechtáal {{followed}} the instructions {{and made the}} spears and the raft. He moved the raft out onto the lake and paddled across with his spears. Grabbing two spears, he attacked the daytime head. As the head began to die and fall, the opposite head woke from its slumber, angry and distressed. Quickly paddling across to the other head, he speared this head with one spear. Then the serpent dove underwater towards a tunnel deep in the lake to escape, but Xwechtáal took the last spear and nailed the serpent head before <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the first}} minute of Darlington's first Football League match, {{at home to}} Halifax Town on 27 August 1921, Winship made a run down the left wing and crossed towards Bill Hooper, whose [...] "driving shot" [...] was [...] "in all probability" [...] the first goal scored in the new division. According to the Northern Echo, Winship was the best player on the field: [...] "time and again <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> down the wing and sent across some lovely centres". He {{provided}} numerous assists over the season, including one cross that confused Wrexham defenders into giving away an own goal, and scored goals as well, including two in a 7–3 defeat of Durham City, as Darlington finished in second place.|$|E

2500|$|Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, {{written by}} Dicks, gives further clarity {{to the history}} between the Doctor and the Master. When the Time Lord (played by David Garth in the {{original}} serial) comes to warn the Doctor, he states [...] "I've come to bring you a warning, {{an old friend of}} yours has arrived on Earth. These days he calls himself The Master." [...] The narrative states that [...] " [...] had been behind several interplanetary wars, always disappearing from the scene before he could be brought to justice. If ever he were caught, his fate would be far worse than the Doctor's exile. Once captured by the Time Lords, the Master's life-stream would be thrown into reverse. Not only would he no longer exist, he never would have existed." [...] The Doctor asks [...] "Is his TARDIS still working?". The Time Lord replies [...] "I'm afraid so. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> before it could be de-energised." [...] "Then he was luckier than I" [...] said the Doctor sadly. He had never really got used to his exile. The Time Lord replies [...] "Don't be bitter Doctor, your punishment was comparatively light".|$|E
2500|$|This {{may help}} {{account for the}} abbey's {{relative}} impunity under Stevens, who sought, through a protracted series of manoeuvres, to annex Sandwell Priory, near West Bromwich [...] in Staffordshire, to Shrewsbury Abbey. In so doing <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> with near-murder. Initially he encouraged one Richard Tudenham to contest {{the position of the}} elected prior, John de Kyngeston. In 1370 Kyngeston took legal action against Stevens after suffering an arrow wound in the arm during an attack by five men. In 1379 Stevens, together with two monks and a secular cleric, abducted Kyngeston and held him at a house in Sleap, north of Shrewsbury, until he signed a resignation. Bishop Robert de Stretton installed as prior of Sandwell one of the Shrewsbury monks involved in the abduction, Brother Richard Westbury. However, the conspirators fell out over the spoils, with Tudenham challenging Westbury's appointment. On Westbury's death in 1397, a successor installed by Bishop Richard le Scrope was driven out by an armed gang. Stevens seems largely to have escaped censure {{for his role in the}} affair. There can be little doubt, however, of his determination to protect and extend the interests of his abbey. It was apparently under Stevens that a party of Shrewsbury monks stole the relics of St Beuno, St Winifred's uncle and confessor, from Rhewl and installed them in the abbey church. Although the abbey was fined, it was allowed to keep the relics. It was also under Stevens that a new shrine was built for St Winifred herself.|$|E

2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> with murder".|$|E
