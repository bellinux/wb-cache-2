500|$|Gunn was {{influenced}} in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager Mike Walker. Himself a former goalkeeper, Walker believed—contrary to popular opinion—that goalkeepers can make good managers because their excellent {{view of the}} game enables them to develop a good tactical awareness. Gunn's short time at Norwich remains his only experience of professional football management. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> the time spent as manager that his only regret is that [...] "there must be a generation of fans who only know me as the manager who lost 7-1 against Colchester… My own memories are different." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Roberto González Echevarría {{argues that}} the {{dictator}} novel is “the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature”, and traces {{the development of this}} theme from “as far back as Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s and Francisco López de Gómara’s accounts of Cortés’s conquest of Mexico.” [...] The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. For critic Gerald Martin, the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme) “the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's Facundo in 1845." [...] In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure “of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he {{is on the verge of}} losing.” ...|$|E
500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It {{is a long way}} the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> his, but my opinion is the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was survived by his wife and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E

500|$|In {{the film}} Madsen tried to {{challenge}} the idea of war as [...] "black and white" [...] {{and the idea that}} the resistance was [...] "a cohesive whole". <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> war that it [...] "has many more nuances, it is grayer, less defined. When an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend can become an enemy overnight, things become less clear". Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E
500|$|Igor Stravinsky {{expressed}} great, but not uncritical, {{enthusiasm for}} Stockhausen's {{music in the}} conversation books with Robert Craft (e.g., [...] ) and for years organised private listening sessions with friends in his home where he played tapes of Stockhausen's latest works ( [...] ; [...] ).

[...] The following October, a report in Sovetskaia Muzyka [...] translated this sentence (and a few others from the same article) into Russian, substituting for the conjunction [...] "but" [...] the phrase [...] "Ia imeiu v vidu Karlkheintsa Shtokkhauzena" [...] ("I am referring to Karlheinz Stockhausen"). When this translation was quoted in Druskin's Stravinsky biography, the field was widened to all of Stockhausen's compositions and Druskin adds for good measure, [...] "indeed, works he calls unnecessary, useless and uninteresting", again quoting from the same Sovetskaia Muzyka article, even though it had made plain that the characterization was of American [...] "university composers" [...]|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, [...] "Harrison {{concentrated}} on pure joyous melodies – {{the kind of}} songs that had made the group so loved", and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Awaiting on You All": [...] "Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by {{turning it into a}} virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'." [...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is hard to think of another big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

[...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game we know and love as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams.

[...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E
