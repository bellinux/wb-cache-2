50|$|The most {{hazardous}} {{property of}} acetone is its extreme flammability. At temperatures greater than acetone's flash point of -20 C, air mixtures of between 2.5% and 12.8% acetone, by volume, may explode or cause a flash fire. Vapors can flow along surfaces to <b>distant</b> <b>ignition</b> sources and flash back. Static discharge may also ignite acetone vapors, though acetone {{has a very}} high ignition initiation energy point and therefore accidental ignition is rare. Even pouring or spraying acetone over red-glowing coal will not ignite it, due to the high concentration of vapour and the cooling effect of evaporation of the liquid. It auto-ignites at 465 C. Auto-ignition temperature is also dependent upon the exposure time, thus at some tests it is quoted as 525 Â°C. Also, industrial acetone is likely to contain {{a small amount of}} water which also inhibits ignition.|$|E
