The first phase was a baseline cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history <b>information</b> <b>documented</b> by physicians in case notes of systematic samples of 900 patients that were stratified over 9 Medical outpatients Units at a premier teaching hospital in south western Nigeria. The second phase was an exploratory study involving 10 pharmacists who conducted cross-sectional medication history interview for 324 randomly selected patients. Results: 49. 2 % of patients, whose medication history were documented at the baseline, by physicians, were males; while 50. 3 % of patient interviewed by pharmacists were male. Mean age (SD) of males and females whose medication histories were documented by physicians and pharmacists were 43. 2 (SD= 18. 6), 43. 1 (SD= 17. 9) years and 51. 5 (SD= 17. 6), 52. 1 (SD= 17. 4) years respectively. The frequency of medication history <b>information</b> <b>documented</b> by pharmacists was significantly higher for twelve of the thirteen medication history components (P < 0. 0001). These include prescription medicines; over the counter medicines; source of medicines; adverse drug reactions; allergy to drugs, allergy to foods, allergy to chemicals; patient adherence; alcohol use; cigarette smoking; dietary restrictions and herbal medicine use. The depth of medication history <b>information</b> acquired and <b>documented</b> by pharmacist was significantly better for all the thirteen medication history components (P< 0. 0001).
