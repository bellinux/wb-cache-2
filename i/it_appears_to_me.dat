2500|$|Kitchener {{wrote to}} Roberts praising French for {{the capture of}} Lotter’s commando, but by 17 January 1902 he wrote to Roberts [...] "French has not done much lately in the colony.

[...] After meeting French at Nauuwport Kitchener recorded (14 February 1902) [...] "he was quite cheerful and happy about progress made, though <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> slow". Ian Hamilton, now Kitchener’s chief of staff, wrote that French was [...] "very much left to his own devices …he {{was one of the}} few men that Kitchener had trusted to do a job on his own".|$|E

I take this to be a monument of a Knight Templar as <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the more ancient because the stone is broader at the head than at the feet". This effigy, in the sculptural style of the 13th century, with its legs broken off below the knees and missing the right arm, is now in Atherington Church, on the floor. It is suggested by Coulter (1993) to represent Sir William de Champernowne, father of Lady Joan Willington. Such figures with crossed legs are generally believed to represent crusaders.|$|E

This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a [...] "wait-and-see" [...] attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin paid a {{visit to}} his brother Erasmus's lady friend the {{literary}} Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological [...] "process of world making" [...] that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. He sat there for almost an hour. [...] "She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman." [...] In her autobiography, she later recalled Charles as being [...] "simple, childlike, painstaking, effective".|$|E

I would like to suggest, that patronage, together with other practices that the age itself reveals to us, may be the avenue most likely to lead us into a fruitful social history of the Scientific Revolution, a movement to which the present generation of scholars has devoted itself extensively. In our investigations, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> we have allowed ourselves to be dominated excessively by concepts derived in the nineteenth century which are more applicable to that century and our own than to ... Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come at the problem from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones. Patronage was certainly a seventeenth-century category.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{opposing}} religion {{often took}} Darwin as their inspiration and expected {{his support for}} their cause, a role he firmly refused. In 1880 {{there was a huge}} controversy when the atheist Charles Bradlaugh was elected as a member of parliament and then prevented from taking his seat in the House of Commons. In response, the secularist Edward Aveling toured the country leading protests. In October of that year Aveling wanted to dedicate his book on Darwin and his Works to Darwin and asked him for permission. Darwin declined, writing that [...] "though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science.

2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that we haven't done anything yet. There is nothing that I can put my hand on and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek {{historian}} Herodotus instead depicts Khufu as a heretic {{and cruel}} tyrant. In his literary work Historiae, Book II, chapter 124–126, he writes: [...] "As long as Rhámpsinîtos was king, as they told me, {{there was nothing}} but orderly rule in Egypt, and the land prospered greatly. But after him Khéops became king over them and brought them to every kind of suffering: He closed all the temples; after this he kept the priests from sacrificing there and then he forced all the Egyptians to work for him. So some were ordered to draw stones from the stone quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he forced to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those called the Libyan mountains. And they worked by 100,000men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> than the pyramid. For the length of it is 5furlongs and the breadth 10fathoms and the height, where it is highest, 8fathoms, and it is made of polished stone and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, 10years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed {{a lawsuit}} against William Weber (the defense lawyer for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had {{examined}} the house), along with Good Housekeeping magazine, the New York Sunday News and the Hearst Corporation, all of which had published articles related to the hauntings. The Lutzes alleged invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names for trade purposes, and mental distress, and claimed $4.5million in damages. Hoffman, Weber, and Burton immediately filed a countersuit for $2million alleging fraud and breach of contract. The claims against the news corporations were dropped for lack of evidence, and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn U.S. District Court judge Jack B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes' claims and observed in his ruling: [...] "Based on what I have heard, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that to a large extent the book is a work of fiction, relying in a large part upon the suggestions of Mr. Weber." [...] In the September 17, 1979 issue of People magazine, William Weber wrote: [...] "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." [...] This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: [...] "There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents." ...|$|E

I consider it highly deserving of public patronage." [...] Bridges shot back, commenting that Randel was [...] "unprincipled", and [...] "conceited", and lacking in [...] "honorable conduct". [...] Randel, of course, responded, listing many, but not all, of the errors in Bridges' map, including islands that were not the right length, width, or in the wrong place, rocks and hills misplaced and mis-sized, rivers and forts too close to each other, missing and misplaced buildings, and streets shown as closed which were not. [...] Bridges, whose reputation both as a surveyor and as a man was far from clean, did not reply, perhaps because his wife was sick at the time, and died several months after Randel's second letter. In any case, Bridges himself died shortly after that, and Randel did not publish his map or have it engraved at that time, due to national security concerns connected with the War of 1812. He eventually published it in 1821.|$|E
