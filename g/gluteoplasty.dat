50|$|As of 2012, Jedlica has {{undergone}} approximately 190 cosmetic procedures. These have included rhinoplasty, chest implants, shoulder implants, bicep implants, triceps implants, brow shaving and lifts, cheek augmentations, subpectoral implants, thigh implants, <b>gluteoplasty,</b> lip augmentations and calf implants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gluteoplasty</b> (Greek gloutόs, rump + plassein, to shape) {{denotes the}} plastic surgery and the {{liposculpture}} {{procedures for the}} correction of the congenital, traumatic, and acquired defects and deformities of the buttocks and the anatomy of the gluteal region; and for the aesthetic enhancement (by augmentation or by reduction) of the contour of the buttocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} a buttocks-contouring {{procedure}} depends upon the specific defect or deformity that can be effectively corrected with liposculpture, ultrasonic or not. Nonetheless, depressed scars and deep morphological defects are difficult to correct because of the curvature of the buttocks as an anatomic unit, {{and because of the}} scar-contracting elements of the tissues across the gluteal curvature. In such a case, although the injection of (autologous or artificial) tissue fillers to correct the defect or the deformity might be impermanent — it usually will remedy the functional and aesthetic shortcoming(s) required by the patient, which is the therapeutic purpose of <b>gluteoplasty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{augmentation}} of the buttocks, by rearranging {{and enhancing}} the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal region, is {{realized with a}} combined <b>gluteoplasty</b> procedure of surgery (subcutaneous dermal-fat flaps) and liposculpture (fat-suction, fat-injection). Therapeutically, such a combined correction-and-enhancement procedure is a realistic and feasible lower-body-lift treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive weight loss (MWL) {{in the course of}} resolving obesity with bariatric surgery. In the case of the man or woman who presents under-projected, flat buttocks (gluteal hypoplasia), and a degree of gluteal-muscle ptosis (prolapsation, falling forward), wherein neither gluteal-implant surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal region, the application of a combined treatment of autologous dermal-fat flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic contour.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{purpose of}} the buttocks musculature {{is to establish a}} stable gait (balanced walk) for the man or the woman who requires the surgical correction of either a defect or a deformity of the gluteal region; therefore, the restoration of anatomic functionality is the therapeutic consideration that determines which <b>gluteoplasty</b> procedure will effectively correct the damaged muscles of the buttocks. The applicable techniques for surgical and fat-transfer correction include the surgical emplacement of gluteal implants; autologous tissue-flaps; the excision (cutting and removal) of damaged tissues; lipoinjection augmentation; and liposuction reduction — to resolve the defect or deformity caused by a traumatic injury (blunt, penetrating, blast) to the buttocks muscles (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus), and any deformation of the anatomic contour of the buttocks. Likewise, the corrective techniques apply to resolving the sagging skin of the body, and the muscle and bone deformities presented by the formerly obese patient, after a massive weight loss (MWL) bariatric surgery procedure; and for resolving congenital defects and congenital deformities of the gluteal region.|$|E
50|$|Reshaping the {{buttocks}} with liposculpture is performed {{with a small}} cannula (2 mm) specifically for contouring superficial body fat, the configuration of which (number of open ports) {{is determined by the}} type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of {{the buttocks}} into an athletic form. The study Contouring the Gluteal Region with Tumescent Liposculpture (2011) indicated that effective, gluteal-region contouring is best achieved by tailoring the liposuction-reduction and the lipoinjection-augmentation techniques to the anatomic topography of the body areas to be corrected. Furthermore, the study Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women: Enhancement and Augmentation (2011) indicated that natural contours of the buttocks and the thighs are effectively achieved with a combined <b>gluteoplasty</b> of selective liposuction and lipoinjection, which reduces the need for aggressive surgical procedures, decreases the risk of medical complications, abbreviates wound-recovery-time, and lessens post-operative scarring. Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial liposculpture facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present a}} case of late {{postoperative}} infection after augmentation <b>gluteoplasty</b> in a 32 -year-old pregnant woman. The case is unique {{in that it is}} the first documented example of a gluteal implant infection in a pregnant woman and because the infection was not preceded by trauma to the anatomic region.

40|$|Gracilis muscle {{transposition}} is {{well established}} in general surgery and has been the main muscle transposition technique for anal incontinence. Dynamization, through a schedule of continuous electrical stimulation, converts the fatigue-prone muscle fibres to a tonic fatigue-resistant morphology with acceptable results in those cases where there is limited sphincter muscle mass. The differences between <b>gluteoplasty</b> and graciloplasty, {{as well as the}} techniques and complications of both procedures, are outlined in this review. Overall, these techniques are rarely carried out in specialized units with experience, as there is a high revision and explantation rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{buttocks}} {{have been}} a symbol of attraction, sexuality and eroticism since ancient times and therefore, they {{have an important role}} in defining the posterior body contour. More and more people are talking about and understand the meaning and the role that buttocks play in modeling and physical beauty. The three dimensional <b>gluteoplasty</b> (3 -DGP) is an innovative technique that allows us to change volume, shape and firmness, not only in the buttocks but also in the adjacent regions such as the thighs and trochanters, becoming an ideal tool to answer the frequent reasons of consultation of our patients about this particular area of the body: [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Fecal incontinence, {{the loss}} of anal {{sphincter}} control leading to the unwanted release of stool or gas, is a physical and psychological handicap that has {{a tremendous impact on}} an individual 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life. Although medical management is the mainstay of therapy for fecal incontinence, the main focus in this review is on invasive techniques with a goal of highlighting newer technologic and therapeutic advancements. While the standard surgical treatment for fecal incontinence still remains direct sphincter repair with an overlapping sphincteroplasty, this review concentrates specifically on biofeedback, the Procon incontinence device, local injection of synthetic materials, radio frequency energy (Secca procedure), antegrade colonic enemas, sphincteroplasty, <b>gluteoplasty,</b> graciloplasty both stimulated and non-stimulated, the artificial bowel sphincter, and sacral nerve stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies of}} gluteal {{augmentation}} techniques {{have been published}} in recent decades, including case reports, retrospective and prospective case series, and multicenter survey reviews. However, to date, there has been no study of the overall complications or satisfaction rates associated with the broad spectrum of techniques. The authors performed a comprehensive literature review to determine outcomes and complications of <b>gluteoplasty</b> techniques, including patient satisfaction. A search on PubMed/Medline was performed for clinical studies involving gluteal augmentation techniques. A priori criteria were used to review the resulting articles. Fifty-two studies, published from 1969 through 2015, were included - representing 7834 treated patients. Five gluteal augmentation techniques were identified from these studies: gluteal augmentation with implants (n = 4781), autologous fat grafting (n = 2609), local flaps (n = 369), hyaluronic acid gel injection (n = 69), and local tissue rearrangement (n = 6). The overall complication rates of the most commonly utilized techniques were: 30. 5 % for gluteal augmentation with implants, 10. 5 % for autologous fat grafting, and 22 % for local flaps. Patients' satisfaction was reported as consistently high for all the five techniques. Implant-based gluteal augmentation is associated with high patients' satisfaction despite a high complication rate, while autologous fat grafting is associated with the lowest complication rate yet including serious major complications such as fat embolism. Local flaps and local tissue rearrangements are the ideal procedures in case of massive weight loss patients. A paucity of data is available for hyaluronic acid gel injections, which appear to be effective but temporary and expensive...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE Many {{rectal cancer}} {{patients}} undergo abdominoperineal excision worldwide every year. Various procedures to restore perineal (pseudo-) continence, {{referred to as}} total anorectal reconstruction, have been proposed. The best technique, however, {{has not yet been}} defined. In this study, the different reconstruction techniques with regard to morbidity, functional outcome and quality of life were analysed. Technical and timing issues (i. e. whether the definitive procedure should be performed synchronously or be delayed), oncological safety, economical aspects as well as possible future improvements are further discussed. METHODS A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was conducted to identify the pertinent multilingual literature between 1989 and 2013. All publications meeting the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria were eligible for analysis. RESULTS Dynamic graciloplasty, artificial bowel sphincter, circular smooth muscle cuff or <b>gluteoplasty</b> result in median resting and squeezing neo-anal pressures that equate to the measurements found in incontinent patients. However, quality of life was generally stated to be good by patients who had undergone the procedures, despite imperfect continence, faecal evacuation problems and a considerable associated morbidity. Many patients developed an alternative perception for the urge to defecate that decisively improved functional outcome. Theoretical calculations suggested cost-effectiveness of total anorectal reconstruction compared well to life with a permanent colostomy. CONCLUSIONS Many patients would be highly motivated to have their abdominal replaced by a functional perineal colostomy. Given the considerable morbidity and questionable functional outcome of current reconstruction technique improvements are required. Tissue engineering might be an option to design an anatomically and physiologically matured, and customised continence organ...|$|E
