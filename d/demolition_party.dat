5|$|With {{the bridge}} having been {{captured}} {{other elements of}} the brigade established a bridgehead for the advancing 11th Armoured and on 19 April they arrived in Lüneburg, where they began to prepare for the crossing of the Elbe. The assault began at 2:00am on 29 April with No. 6 Commando leading the way across in Buffalo landing vehicles. Under fire the entire way, they landed downstream from the objective—Lauenburg—and launched an assault against the defenders who were perched on a cliff overlooking the narrow landing beach. After reaching the top of the cliff, they broke through the defences and established themselves {{to the north of the}} town, while the rest of the brigade came up. Throughout the remainder of the day, the town was cleared and patrols sent out; a patrol from No. 6 Commando captured the Elbe–Trave Canal bridge, arriving just as the <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> was preparing it for detonation.|$|E
25|$|At Riqueval {{they got}} {{an even bigger}} prize: the Germans had left the {{concrete}} bridge standing as the main supply route for their troops on the western bank. The bridge had been prepared for demolition, but the Germans considered the sector impregnable. A company of 6th North Staffs was detailed to rush the bridge before the Germans could blow it. Captain A.H. Charlton and nine men dashed out of the fog, bayoneted the machine-gunners guarding the west end, and ran across the bridge in a race with the <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> emerging from a bunker at the east end (where a memorial erected by the Western Front Association now stands). The Staffords won the race, shooting the Germans and cutting the leads to the demolition charges.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, on 26 December 1941, No. 12 Commando {{took part}} in Operation Anklet, which was the only raid it {{undertook}} during its history where the entire unit took part. The operation was a diversionary raid on the Lofoten Islands in Norway, {{as part of the}} wider Operation Archery, which was a larger commando raid on Vågsøy and Måløy. No. 12 Commando along with 68 Norwegians from Norwegian Independent Company 1 and a <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> landed on the island capturing the German garrison who surrendered without a fight. Under Harrison's command, they landed at Reine and after the garrison surrendered, the commandos stayed on the island for two days to carry out demolitions work, destroying two German wireless stations before withdrawing. They took 29 German prisoners and over 200 volunteers for the free Norwegian forces in Britain with them.|$|E

50|$|The next {{operation}} that men from No. 9 {{were involved in}} was the St. Nazaire Raid in March 1942, the main landing force was provided by No. 2 Commando {{but most of the}} other commando units supplied <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> to assist in demolishing the port facilities.|$|R
25|$|The main {{commando}} {{force was}} 100 men from No.2 Commando. In addition to demolition tasks, {{they were to}} assault the harbour gun positions and provide covering fire for the <b>demolition</b> <b>parties.</b> <b>Demolition</b> <b>Parties</b> from No.2 Commando were supported by those drawn from No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 9 and No. 12 Commando. The raid was considered a success even with 25% of the force killed {{and most of the}} rest captured. Commando Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Newman and his surviving troops were captured trying to escape the town into open country, when they ran out of ammunition. For his part in the raid Newman was awarded the Victoria Cross. A posthumous Victoria Cross was awarded after the war to Sergeant Thomas Durrant of No. 1 Commando for his part in the raid, upon recommendation by Newman.|$|R
25|$|As Yeo secured his {{position}} from {{attack from the}} river, Hugues arrived at Dégras de Cannes. Despite attacking Lieutenant Colonel Marques' garrison immediately, Hugues was unable to defeat the Portuguese before Yeo returned, {{and was forced to}} retreat after a three-hour engagement. A secondary force sent against Fort Diamant saw the British <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> on the walls and, assuming the garrison there to be larger than expected, retreated without an assault. The following morning, as Hugues fell back on his residence, Yeo followed, using the river and canal to close with the position. Hugues had fortified his property with 100 men and two artillery pieces, and ordered his men to fire on a party of British sailors offering a truce. A second attempt was met with cannon fire, and although a third attempt via one of Hugues' slaves drew a response, the French general's overtures were only an attempt to stall the Allies while his men laid an ambush in the trees near their landing point.|$|E
500|$|Early on 26 March {{the rest}} of the ANZAC Mounted Division arrived, and the ICCB that evening. To cut off Amman from reinforcements, one of the regiment's troops set out that night and {{destroyed}} a section of the Hedjaz rail line to the south of the town. They returned the next morning without loss. Orders were issued for the attack on the town; the brigade would assault from the south. The 2nd Squadron was to provide flank protection, located in the area [...] south-east of Es Sir. The rest of the regiment, including the headquarters, the 9th Squadron, and half a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron, escorted a <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> to destroy the railway station at Kissar, just under [...] to the south of Amman. En route the 9th Squadron located a train carrying around three hundred Turkish troops, stopped in a cutting. When they opened fire the train pulled out towards Kissar, where it ran into a squadron from the Auckland Mounted Rifles and one of the 9th Squadron's troops. Some of the Turks left the train to fight on foot, while the train continued on to Amman, leaving them behind. The regiment's men left the <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> to be escorted by troops from the ICCB, and returned to the brigade outside Amman.|$|E
500|$|The German attack {{commenced}} on 14 April and {{the brigade}} defended its position {{for three days}} before being withdrawn. Kippenberger's battalion was chosen to be the rearguard and he personally intervened in the demolition of bridges and culverts through Servia Pass to ensure that as many stragglers as possible were collected. [...] He {{and some of his}} <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> later came under artillery and tank fire as they attempted {{to catch up with the}} main body of the brigade, and were forced to abandon their vehicles and rejoin the battalion on foot. After conducting further delaying actions on the road leading into Athens, Kippenberger and his command were evacuated to Crete on 28 April.|$|E
25|$|Within the 1st Light Horse and the Imperial Camel Brigades special <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> {{were trained}} to assist the Royal Engineers. The Engineers in the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions Field Squadrons and the Australian Field Troop {{attached}} to the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, were reinforced by about 100 men from the mounted regiment who received intensive training in railway demolitions over a few days.|$|R
50|$|Through naval gunfire and <b>demolition</b> <b>parties,</b> 18,000 tons of {{shipping}} were sunk. Perhaps {{the most significant}} outcome of the raid, however, was the capture {{of a set of}} rotor wheels for an Enigma cypher machine and its code books from the German armed trawler Krebs. This enabled German naval codes to be read at Bletchley Park, providing the intelligence needed to allow Allied convoys to avoid U-boat concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB {{need not have}} landed, but {{he was one of}} the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> had completed their tasks.|$|R
500|$|Tessé wrote bitterly to {{the king}} to blame the Spanish, telling him that [...] "we have failed before Gibraltar for want of method and {{planning}} [...] [...] [...] the ill-fate of your vessels was {{due to lack of}} competence at Madrid [...] [...] [...]" [...] With the French having gone home, Villadarias resumed command and began to convert the siege into a blockade by pulling back from the isthmus and removing his cannon. On 2 May, an Alliance scouting party found that the Spanish trenches had been abandoned. Later that day, Hesse accompanied a <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> to destroy the Bourbon Spanish works, but some members of the party ventured out too far and were captured or killed by the Spanish cavalry. The following day, a larger party, protected by grenadiers, resumed the work of demolishing the Spanish batteries without further opposition, marking the end of the siege.|$|E
500|$|When the British {{began to}} prepare for war in July 1914, the ship was {{refitting}} at Malta. Her refit was cut short and she joined {{the rest of her}} squadron in the southern approaches to the Adriatic. She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau at the outbreak of World War I, but was ordered not to engage them. On 10 August Duke of Edinburgh and her sister ship [...] were ordered to the Red Sea to protect troop convoys arriving from India. While on that duty the ship captured the German merchantman Altair of 3,200 tons GRT on 15 August. While escorting a troop convoy from India to France in November 1914, Duke of Edinburgh provided cover to three battalions of infantry that seized the Turkish fort at Cheikh Saïd {{at the entrance to the}} Red Sea. The ship then landed a <b>demolition</b> <b>party,</b> which blew the fort up on 10 November; she then rejoined the convoy.|$|E

50|$|On 28 March 1942 in {{the attack}} on St. Nazaire, France, Lieutenant Colonel Newman {{was in charge of}} the {{military}} forces and he was one of the first ashore, leading his men and directing operations quite regardless of his own safety. Under his inspiring leadership the troops fought magnificently and held vastly superior numbers of the enemy at bay until the <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> had done their work. The colonel then attempted to fight through into open country and not until all the ammunition was spent were he and his men overwhelmed and taken prisoner.|$|R
50|$|The troops {{landed on}} the 25 August and, as hoped, met no {{opposition}} throughout and were enthusiastically greeted by the islanders. When the demolitions at Barentsburg were complete, some 2,000 Soviet miners and their movable belongings and equipment were taken to Arkhangelsk, in Russia, on the , escorted by Nigeria, {{where a group of}} nearly 200 Free French were found waiting. These French had escaped from German prison camps and were duly taken on board for passage to the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, the rest of Force K and the <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> had moved on to Longyearbyen.|$|R
50|$|He {{worked as}} {{part-time}} Air Raid Warden, leading a detachment of rescue and <b>demolition</b> <b>parties</b> in Bridlington. The coastal town was soon attacked by Luftwaffe bombers, and residential areas were hit. On three occasions in August 1940 he led rescue teams and entered dangerous buildings to rescue trapped civilians. He {{was the first}} person to receive the newly instituted George Cross from the King, and in a radio broadcast of the time insisted that his award was for all the rescue parties in Bridlington. This interview can be heard in full on The Blitz, an audiobook CD of wartime recordings.|$|R
2500|$|The Anzac Mounted Division arrived near Hill 820 at 02:00 {{but could}} not locate it. Instead, the {{division}} less the 1st Light Horse Brigade and <b>Demolition</b> <b>party</b> was established at Hill 770 [...] {{to the south of}} Hill 820. The mistake was discovered later but the division remained at Hill 770 for the day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evacuation}} {{from the}} southern ports on the Bay of Biscay was commanded by Admiral Sir Martin Dunbar-Nasmith, the Commander-in-Chief of Western Approaches Command based in Devonport. The evacuation was made more difficult {{by a lack of}} information from Brest, St Nazaire and Nantes. Brest is a port city in the Finistère département in Brittany in north-west France, where a sense of urgency was communicated by the Cabinet in London and the evacuation was conducted quickly, albeit with some confusion; guns and vehicles which could have been removed were destroyed needlessly. The Germans were known to be in Paris and advancing southwards, but information about German progress was inaccurate, mainly being rumour. The ships, including the Arandora Star, Strathaird and Otranto rescued [...] and [...] personnel, mostly RAF ground crew from [...] and the ships with room to spare were sent south to St Nazaire and the French wrecked the harbour facilities with assistance from the British <b>demolition</b> <b>party.</b> The French ships sailed and on 19 June the <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> was removed aboard the destroyer [...]|$|E
2500|$|Royal Navy ships shot {{their way}} {{into and out of}} the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German {{positions}} as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy <b>demolition</b> <b>party.</b> During a lull in the afternoon, a Luftwaffe force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at [...] the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.|$|E
5000|$|From 12-14 July, Pennsylvania {{conducted}} a bombardment of Guam {{in preparation for}} the assault and landings on that island. On completion of firing the evening of 14 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish ammunition. She returned to Guam on 17 July, and delivered protective fire support for <b>demolition</b> <b>parties.</b> At the same time she continued deliberate destructive fire on designated targets through 20 July. During the Guam campaign, she fired more ammunition than any other warship in history during a single campaign. She in fact earned one of her nicknames, [...] "Old Falling Apart" [...] because she expelled so much metal she appeared to be falling apart.|$|R
25|$|German {{reaction}} to the landing was swift and their reconnaissance patrols were in the area within 20 minutes and the British base located and attacked within 24 hours. Avoiding a pitched battle the three patrols split up {{and for the next}} seven days disrupted German convoys and <b>demolition</b> <b>parties.</b> In response to the British presence a German brigade was detailed to locate the force and a division, held back in reserve instead of moving to reinforce the front line. During their search for the parachutists amongst other casualties, the Germans captured the detachments signallers and radio contact with the New Zealand division was lost when the detachments sole remaining radio was damaged.|$|R
50|$|On 25 February the Allied {{attacked}} again, the Ottomans evacuated {{the outer}} defences and the fleet entered the straits {{to engage the}} intermediate defences. <b>Demolition</b> <b>parties</b> of Royal Marines raided the Sedd el Bahr and Kum Kale forts, meeting little opposition. On 1 March, four battleships bombarded the intermediate defences but little progress was made clearing the minefields. The minesweepers, commanded by the chief of staff, Roger Keyes, were un-armoured trawlers manned by their civilian crews, who were unwilling to work while under fire. The strong current in the straits further hampered minesweeping and strengthened Ottoman resolve which had wavered {{at the start of}} the offensive; on 4 March, twenty-three marines were killed raiding the outer defences.|$|R
2500|$|By {{clearing}} these fields, Allied warships {{could now}} enter the Dardanelles themselves, opening {{the route to}} attack additional fortifications around the town of Dardanus. While other vessels shelled the forts there, Vengeance and the battleship [...] sent men ashore to destroy an abandoned artillery battery near Kumkale, with both ships remaining off shore to support the raid. The men landed unopposed, but the detachment from Vengeance quickly came under fire from Ottoman infantry {{on the far side}} of Kumkale. Lieutenant-Commander Eric Gascoigne Robinson, who led Vengeances <b>demolition</b> <b>party,</b> went forward by himself to destroy an Ottoman anti-aircraft gun, then led his detachment to destroy a second anti-aircraft gun and the one remaining gun at the Orkanie battery. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Ottoman resistance prevented any further action, and the men returned to Vengeance.|$|E
2500|$|Operation Dynamo, the {{evacuation}} at Dunkirk from 26 May to 3 June, had rescued {{much of the}} fighting element of the BEF.

By the end of May, medical stores {{had been removed from}} Dieppe and a <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> landed, ready to blow up the port infrastructure. A big depot at Le Havre had been run down by using it to feed troops in the area and removing the military stores not immediately needed. A reserve of motor transport collected at Rouen had been used as transport for improvised units and specialised ammunition had been moved from the reserve around Buchy but the removal of the huge quantity of ordinary ammunition accumulated there was impossible.|$|E

A brigade forced its way out but lost the wireless truck intended to keep contact with the 51st (Highland) Division. The possibility of holding a line from Fécamp to Lillebonne was discounted and Stanley-Clarke ordered Arkforce on to Le Havre. A Royal Navy <b>demolition</b> <b>party</b> had been in Le Havre since late May and the port was severely bombed by the Luftwaffe on 7 June and two days later, the Admiralty sent orders for an evacuation.

2500|$|An {{hour after}} dawn, Fort de la Crèche near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was {{captured}} by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt {{that there would be}} no reinforcements from Calais. Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring. By [...] the determined German attack from the south had forced the Irish Guards back into the town.
