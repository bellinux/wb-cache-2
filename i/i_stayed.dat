5|$|Some monastic cells, {{thought to}} belong to the friary, survive under the Red Lodge, which had its origins as a {{prospect}} house for the prior of Whitefriars. This building became the lodge house of an Elizabethan mansion, the Great House, built in the late 16th century by John Young, who had bought the friary from Bristol Corporation after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Great House was where Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>stayed,</b> as a guest of John Young, in 1574. In the 18th century, the house was acquired by Edward Colston, who established the original Colston's School there. After the school moved to Stapleton in 1857, the Colston Hall Society purchased the premises, and demolished the house to build the Colston Hall, which now occupies the site. Excavations during the building of the adjacent Colston House in the early 20th century found medieval walls, burials and floor tiles.|$|E

25|$|The Cajas Reales {{was where}} miners paid a 20% {{share of their}} extractions to the Spanish Crown. It not only {{collected}} the taxes, {{it was the only}} place that sold the mercury needed to extract silver from ore as a monopoly of the state. It was constructed in the 17th century by viceroy Sebastián de Toledo Márquez Mancera. It is a two-story building with a central patio. The façade contains two towers that flank the main entrance and the north side to serve as guard stations for the building. It has housed the offices of the Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca since 1850. Emperor Maximillian <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> here when he visited the city in 1865.|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing.

500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and <b>I</b> <b>stayed.</b> People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left."

Johnson revealed that he needed Vicodin to play through the final three months of the 2007 season. He needed the medication to help him play with a bone bruise in his back.

[...] "I was taking Vicodin twice a game just to get through the game. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> hurt the whole season, probably because I was trying to come back too soon."

[...] The Breeders re-recorded [...] "Son of Three" [...] in July 2002 for its release as Title TKs third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year.

500|$|In February 1940 Welles {{supplied}} Mankiewicz with 300 {{pages of}} notes {{and put him}} under contract to write the first draft screenplay {{under the supervision of}} John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, [...] "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> in Hollywood and wrote mine." [...] Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, [...] "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own." ...|$|E

"Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] {{incorporated}} {{the use of}} the Electronic LinnDrum machine, {{and was one of the}} first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single [...] "Do Your Dance", but in [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] its use was more spontaneous, which Dave Thompson, author of Funk noted as if [...] "it virtually duetted with Dickey, creating one of the most distinctive records of the year—and one of the most imitated of the age." [...] The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording. Buckmaster recalled: [...] "I was over at [...] place almost every day with Norman, and some days <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> away to write, or to mix the music. Gene had given me the keys to his apartment, and also let me use the piano to record the song. I didn't want to work on at Miles' because his piano was falling to bits." ...|$|E

500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E

500|$|Fincher {{stated that}} every main cast member {{was their first}} choice. In the first read through, he said [...] "I want {{everybody}} here {{to know that you}} represent our first choice— each actor here represents our first choice for these characters. So do not fuck this up." [...] Spacey, whose last regular television role was in the series Wiseguy, responded positively to the script. He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> in and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones". He was officially cast on March 18, 2011. Robin Wright was approached by Fincher to star in the series when they worked together in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word for me with Fincher". The next month, she got a call for an audition.|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E
