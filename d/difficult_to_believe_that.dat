However, the team found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching {{was impressed by the}} script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{architectural}} similarities {{with the}} castles of Sheriff Hutton, Bolton, and Lumley, historian Eric John Fisher suggested that Wressle Castle {{was built in}} the last quarter of the 14th century.

The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the physical appearance of Tess, the team aimed {{to make her}} look [...] "tough and capable", striving to add an element of strength {{in order to show}} that she might be more ruthless than Joel.

However, the team found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by majorly altering the story.

Powell and his wife were both painters, and would let Lynch work with their materials while he was staying in town; however, Lynch found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> art was something in which he could forge a career, believing it to be a hobby peculiar to the Western United States. Returning home to Virginia, Lynch met Keeler's father Bushnell, who was also an artist.

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A−" [...] rating. He {{felt that the}} scene showing Leo Johnson {{domestically}} abusing his wife was [...] "among the show's most disturbing moments", comparing it to {{a scene from the}} 1990 film The Grifters. Phipps also felt the sound design in the episode was impressive, commenting positively on the blurred distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic music. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau felt that the episode showed series composer Angelo Badalamenti to have limited range, repeating several similar musical cues throughout. He also considered Eric Da Re's performance as Leo Johnson to be unconvincing, finding it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the character was as feared and menacing as was implied. However, Blau described the introduction of Killer Bob as still seeming powerful and frightening even several years after first being seen, considering it a potent and disturbing scene.|$|E

He called a macaroni gratin with mushrooms and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese [...] "fantastic" [...] and said that an apple crumble was [...] "awesome". Mark Bollard, in his review of the restaurant for the Evening Standard in 2009, was not expecting much from the restaurant. However, he called his Caesar salad starter a [...] "revelation" [...] {{and said that the}} chocolate brownie was [...] "dense, dark and rich". Although he was disappointed with the polenta chips, he said overall that the food was [...] "utterly sublime" [...] and he suggested that Ramsay should expand the concept to railway stations across London.

5000|$|James held {{strongly}} traditional {{views about}} literature. In addition to ghost stories, he also enjoyed reading {{the work of}} William Shakespeare and the detective stories of Agatha Christie. [...] By contrast, James disliked most contemporary literature, strongly criticizing the work of Aldous Huxley, Lytton Strachey and James Joyce (whom James called [...] "a charlatan" [...] and [...] "that prostitutor of life and language"). James also supported the banning of Radclyffe Hall's 1928 novel about lesbianism, The Well of Loneliness, stating, [...] "I believe Miss Hall's book is about birth control or some kindred subject, isn't it.

500|$|.....yet {{the general}} {{aspect of the}} island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by {{decomposed}} volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes {{so long as it}} was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications! ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blink" [...] {{received}} universal critical acclaim, {{with many}} praising the acting, the script, {{the level of}} fear and the Weeping Angels themselves. The Guardian Stephen Brook called it a [...] "wonderfully creepy episode" [...] that [...] "ultimately made sense" [...] despite [...] "barely featur the Doctor and Martha". David Bradley of SFX awarded [...] "Blink" [...] five out of five stars, saying {{that it could have}} featured any of the previous Doctors and predicted that its [...] "timelessness" [...] would ensure that it would [...] " [...] down as one of the finest, scariest, cleverest Who episodes ever". IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, praising the way the audience felt they had known Sally Sparrow for a while, as well as the strength of Mulligan's performance, although he noted that [...] "all of the performances in this episode are exceptional". He concluded that, [...] "it's <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> so much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode was not just the best Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the [...] "tenderness of the story and the characters" [...] which were [...] "quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes". The Daily Telegraph named the episode one of the best of the show's entire run, noting that, while the Doctor [...] "is somewhat on the periphery here", it [...] "adds to the threat".|$|E

60|$|The {{compassion}} excited in all {{the witnesses}} was not without its danger to Tito; for conjecture is constantly guided by feeling, {{and more than one}} person suddenly conceived that this man might have been a scholar and have lost his faculties.

And the originally common type of Baldassarre's person, coarsened by years of hardship, told as a confirmation of Tito's lie. If Baldassarre, to begin with, could have uttered precisely the words he had premeditated, there might have been something in the form of his accusation which would have given it the stamp not only of true experience but of mental refinement. But there had been no such testimony in his impulsive agitated words: and there seemed the very opposite testimony in the rugged face and the coarse hands that trembled beside it, standing out in strong contrast in the midst of that velvet-clad, fair-handed company.|$|R

500|$|Linois {{continued}} his raiding, achieving some success against individual sailing ships, but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against British naval forces; most notably at the Battle of Vizagapatam on 15 September 1804 and the Action of 6 August 1805. Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking {{a squadron of}} British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic. Linois was concerned throughout the engagement {{for the safety of}} his ships: with the nearest dockyard over [...] away at Île de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled. He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force. Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that [...] "it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois" [...] and William Laird Clowes stated in 1900 that [...] "his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity". Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that [...] "his [...] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he was." [...] He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that [...] "Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least £8 million through mere timidity". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decrès on the subject, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Durst's {{controversy}} with Britney Spears provided lyrical {{inspiration for}} Results May Vary. There were rumors that Durst and Spears {{were in a}} relationship. Durst wrote three songs for Spears' 2003 album In the Zone. Durst and Spears worked on those songs in a studio. After Spears denied the relationship, Durst refused to allow those three songs to appear on Spears' 2003 album In the Zone. Results May Vary features a cover of The Who's [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] with a Speak & Spell during the song's bridge. [...] "Gimme the Mic" [...] includes lyrics from the Beastie Boys' [...] "Pass the Mic" [...] and Eric B. & Rakim's [...] "Microphone Fiend", and [...] "Let Me Down" [...] samples Steve Miller's [...] "Take the Money and Run". [...] "Head for the Barricade" [...] borrows from the song [...] "Stick 'Em" [...] by the Fat Boys. [...] "Phenomenon" [...] borrows the line, [...] "Once again back it's the incredible", from [...] "Bring the Noise" [...] by Public Enemy. The album demonstrates Limp Bizkit's gloomy side, with more-serious, less-confident lyrics than previous songs. Lyrical topics include bullying, Durst's past, self-pity, betrayal, childhood pain, heartbreak, feeling misunderstood, love and Durst's views on MTV and radio. About [...] "Down Another Day", Joe D'Angelo of MTV found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> lyrics that were similar to Mayer's could come from Durst, whom, according to D'Angelo, had recently [...] "likened himself to a chainsaw and threatened to skin your ass raw". [...] "Eat You Alive" [...] was reportedly about Britney Spears (rumored {{to be involved with}} Durst) or Angelina Jolie (whom Durst admired). According to Durst, [...] "The scream in 'Eat You Alive' is like an animalistic, sexual, crazy, primitive roar", and the desire which came with this behavior. Durst said that [...] "Just Drop Dead" [...] was not (as had been speculated) about Britney Spears, but was about his experience with her. Durst also said that [...] "Just Drop Dead" [...] was inspired by other women. Also, Durst said that [...] "Just Drop Dead" [...] is [...] "about a girl who acts like a whore". According to Durst, [...] "'Underneath the Gun' is about suicide and the struggle you can have when ending your life becomes an option".|$|E
500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon.

Władysław I Herman, however, agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while the Prince - Władysław I himself - kept control of Mazovia and its capital at Płock. Władysław also retained control of the most important cities i.e. Wrocław, Kraków and Sandomierz.
