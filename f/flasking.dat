40|$|Abstract. The {{materials}} of fusing metals commercially {{used in the}} jewelry niche marketing is seen as precious metals. An innovation of fusing metals searched for new materials to differentiate from the markets for mass production. In this research, it studied the bonding processes of silver and aluminium metals by casting processes for mass productions. The studies had been varied parameters on the types of aluminium and process temperature controls. This research had used two types of aluminium which were pure aluminium 99. 99 % and aluminum 5083 alloys bonding with pure silver 99. 99 %. The temperatures had been specified for two factors including casting temperature at X 1, X 2 and <b>flasking</b> temperature at Y 1, Y 2. From the results, {{it was found that}} the casting temperature at 730 °C and the <b>flasking</b> temperature at 230 °C of pure silver-aluminum 5083 alloys bonding had the thinnest average thickness of interface at 427. 29 µm. The microstructure of pure silver-aluminum 5083 alloy bonding was revealed eutectic-like structures at the interfaces. The EDS analysis showed the results of compounds at interface layers of Ag sides giving Ag 2 Al intermetallics on pure silver-aluminum 5083 alloy bonding unlike pure silver-pure aluminium bonding giving Ag 3 Al intermetallics...|$|E

The study included 116 edentulous patients who received complete dentures. The respondents were divided into two groups according to the type of denture used. Thirty one patients were rehabilitated with complete dentures {{reinforced with}} metal base, whereas 85 patients received conventional complete acrylic dentures. Metal bases were fabricated using Co-Cr-Mo alloy. Two designs different in regards to the vibrating line were fabricated: metal frame extended to the vibrating line and acrylic resin extended to the vibrating line.

40|$|Background Denture teeth play a {{critical}} role in overall aesthetic outcomes of removable complete dentures, and long-term maintenance of these outcomes depends on the color stability of the prosthetic teeth. The characteristics of denture base resins play a significant role in prosthetic clinical performance and aesthetics. Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of two <b>flasking</b> materials on the color stability of five brands of denture teeth that were immersed in commonly consumed beverages. Materials and Methods In the present study 560 denture teeth (20 series) were invested with heat- and cold-cured acrylic resin. All the specimens were thermo cycled between 4 °C and 60 °C, with 60 Seconds dwell times for 1000 cycles. Subsequently, the specimens in each group were divided into four subgroups based on the immersion medium: coffee, tea, cola, or distilled water. Digital images of the teeth were taken before immersion and 30 days after immersion. The color samples were measured using the CIE L* a* b* system, and color differences (ΔE) were calculated. The data were evaluated by 3 -way ANOVA and the Tukey HSD test. Results There were significant differences in color change between the cold-cured acrylic resins and the heat-cured acrylic resins, with a reduced amount of discoloration in the heat-cured group (ΔE = 10. 12 ± 3. 93, P = 0. 001). The solutions showed significantly different amounts of discoloration on the teeth; distilled water had the least effect (ΔE = 8. 49 ± 2. 62, P = 0. 001) and coffee had the maximum discoloration (ΔE = 14. 14 ± 7. 77, P = 0. 001). A Tukey test showed that there was no significant difference between each brand of denture teeth. Conclusions Coffee caused the most color changes in the examined resin denture teeth. Tea and cola left less staining on the teeth, and distilled water caused the least discoloration. Generally, investing by heat- and cold-cured acrylic resins can significantly affect the color stability of resin denture teeth; however, heat-cured acrylic resins had fewer color changes...|$|E

Four-month-old, aseptically raised Phalaenopsis Atien Kaala 'TSC 22 ' seedlings 1. 0 cm in leaf spread were transferred (Nov. 1995), 25 per polycarbonate box, to an agar medium and placed under 10, 20, 40, or 80 [molem- 2 *s- 1 PPF] from cool-white fluorescent tubes. In June 1996, plants grown under 40 or 80 [molom- 2 *s-I PPF] had greater mass, wider leaves, and more roots than those under the two lower PPF. Plants were then transplanted and grown in a greenhouse (GH) under 12 %, 5. 4 % or 2. 6 % of full sunlight. In May 1997, plants previously produced under 40 [limolom- 2 os- 1] PPF had longer, wider, and thicker leaves than those under 10 [2 *s-I PPF] when grown under the two higher GH PPF. Plants under the high, medium, and low GH PPF had an average of 61, 37, and 17 g of fresh mass, respectively. By September 1997, plants had increasingly larger leaves and higher concentrations of malic acid, sugars, and starch as GH PPF increased. Each doubling in GH PPF resulted in more than a two-fold increase in plant fresh mass. Under the low GH PPF, plants previously produced under 80 [molem- 2 *s-l] PPF during <b>flasking</b> were 13 % larger than those under 10 [umol 2 *s-l PPF].

Plants grown in the fir bark medium with 2 ON- 2. 2 P-I 5. 8 K fertilizer had more leaf production, greater leaf fresh mass, greater total leaf area and greater root fresh mass than with any other fertilizers. In the bark/peat medium, the [2 ON 2. 2 P-I 5. 8 K and 2 ON- 8. 6 P-I 6. 6 K] fertilizers resulted in similar leaf production, greater fresh mass, greater area, and greater root fresh mass than the other fertilizers. The bark medium, regardless of fertilizer, had higher pH and lower EC then the bark/peat medium. The bark/peat medium had higher concentrations of NH 4 +, N 03 -, Ca, Fe, Na, Cl, B and Al in the leachate. Media and fertilizers had little effect on the mineral composition of the leaves...|$|E

50|$|Büchner <b>flask</b> or Sidearm <b>flask</b> or Suction <b>flask</b> - {{they are}} a {{flat-bottomed}} <b>flask,</b> but made of very thick and resistant glass. They are usually a cone shape - similar {{to the shape of}} an Erlenmeyer <b>flask,</b> but also have side neck, usually affixed to the side, 2 / 3 up from the bottom. The <b>flasks</b> are used to cooperate with vacuum aspirator or vacuum pumps in the vacuum filtration, or as additional security during the distillation and other processes carried out under reduced pressure.|$|R

Similar to the reaction <b>flask,</b> the distillation <b>flasks</b> usually have only one narrow neck and a ground glass joint and are made of thinner glass than the reaction <b>flask,</b> so that it is easier to heat. They are sometimes spherical, test tube shaped, or pear-shaped, also known as a Kjeldahl <b>Flask,</b> due to its use with Kjeldahl bulbs.|$|R
50|$|A <b>flask</b> {{is a type}} of tooling used {{to contain}} a mold in metal casting. A <b>flask</b> has only sides, and no top or bottom, and forms a frame around the mold, which is {{typically}} made of molding sand. The shape of a <b>flask</b> may be square, rectangular, round or any convenient shape. A <b>flask</b> can be any size so long as it is larger than the pattern being used to make the sand mold. <b>Flasks</b> are commonly made of steel, aluminum or even wood. A simple <b>flask</b> has two parts, the cope and the drag, and more elaborate <b>flasks</b> may have three or even four parts.|$|R
