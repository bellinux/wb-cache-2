40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{summarize}} recent studies on nondopaminergic options for the treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Data Sources: Papers in English published in PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid Nursing databases between January 1988 and November 2016 were searched using the following keywords: PD, nondopaminergic therapy, adenosine, glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, <b>histaminic,</b> and iron chelator. We also reviewed the ongoing clinical trials in the website of clinicaltrials. gov. Study Selection: Articles related to the nondopaminergic treatment of motor symptoms in PD were selected for this review. Results: PD is conventionally treated with dopamine replacement strategies, which are effective in the early stages of PD. Long-term use of levodopa could result in motor complications. Recent studies revealed that nondopaminergic systems such as adenosine, glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, <b>histaminic,</b> and iron chelator pathways could include potential therapeutic targets for motor symptoms, including motor fluctuations, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and gait disorders. Some nondopaminergic drugs, such as istradefylline and amantadine, are currently used clinically, while most such drugs are in preclinical testing stages. Transitioning of these agents into clinically beneficial strategies requires reliable evaluation since several agents have failed to show consistent results despite positive findings at the preclinical level. Conclusions: Targeting nondopaminergic transmission could improve some motor symptoms in PD, especially the discomfort of dyskinesia. Although nondopaminergic treatments show great potential in PD treatment as an adjunct therapy to levodopa, further investigation is required to ensure their success...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Muscle relaxants cause {{bronchospasm}} via histamine release and/or {{by acting}} on the muscarinic receptors; we sought to characterize the respective importance of these pathways {{in the presence of}} bronchial hyperreactivity. METHODS: Ovalbumin-sensitized rabbits were randomly assigned to several protocol groups: Group C comprised untreated animals; in the other three groups, either H 1 and H 2 <b>histaminic</b> receptor blockade was performed, leaving the M 1, M 2, and M 3 muscarinic receptors functional (Group M 123), or combining this treatment with M 3 muscarinic receptor blockade (Group M 12), or with vagotomy (Group M 3). Respiratory system impedance was measured over a 90 -s period, during which succinylcholine, mivacurium or atracurium was administered. To monitor the changes in lung mechanics, respiratory system impedance was averaged in a 2 -s time window and fitted by a model featuring airway resistance and inertance and tissue damping and elastance. RESULTS: The peak increases in airway resistance in Group C were greatest with succinylcholine (79 +/- 17 [SE]%) and mivacurium administration (75 % +/- 12 %), whereas they were lower after attracurium (40 % +/- 11 %). These changes were markedly attenuated by both histamine and muscarinic receptor blockade with the largest reduction in Group M 3 for succinylcholine (14 % +/- 5. 2 %), and in Group M 123 for mivacurium (5. 1 % +/- 9. 1 %) and attracurium (7. 8 % +/- 4. 0 %). DISCUSSION: Although the bronchospasm developing in the allergic airways after muscle relaxants is mediated primarily by the <b>histaminic</b> pathway, the interactions of succinylcholine on the M 1, M 2, and M 3 receptors, those of atracurium on the M 1 and M 2 receptors, and those of mivacurium on the M 3 receptors may also play a role...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. We studied {{isolated}} ring segments from {{a number}} of sites along the course of epicardial coronary arteries from 24 human hearts in order to characterize regional responsiveness to vasoactive agents. Concentration-response curves revealed heightened sensitivity to histamine in the proximal portion of the coronary arteries, and increased sensitivity to carbachol in the distal portion of these same vessels. In contrast, the response to stimulation by calcium or phenylephrine was uniform throughout the length of the vessels examined. These data suggest that regional variations in agonist response reflect heterogeneity in receptor populations along the course of the human epicardial coronary artery. (Circ Res 55 : 416 - 421, 1984) ANIMAL studies have demonstrated that a heter-ogeneous response to a vasoactive agent may occur over the length of a blood vessel (Altura and Altura, 1970; Hellegouarch et al., 1982; Bristow et al., 1981). As applied to the human epicardial coronary artery, regional heterogeneity in pharmacological response could be involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow, or in the development of vasospastic syndromes.

The acute anti-inflammatory effects of this extract were evaluated using carrageenan-, bradykinin-, and 5 -HT-induced rat paw edema. The chronic anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated using formaldehyde-induced rat paw edema. Results and Analysis: Inhibition of inflammation was seen to be 32. 22 % in carrageenan-induced, 37. 70 % in 5 -HT-induced, and 35. 21 % in bradykinin-induced anti-inflammatory models. In chronic inflammatory model, a progressive inhibition of 34. 73 % (3 rd day), 37. 50 % (5 th day), 38. 83 % (7 th day), 44. 66 % (9 th day), 49. 59 % (11 th day), and 55. 75 % (13 th day) was observed with study compound.

Such factors include sexual drive (libido), physiological arousal (lubrication/erection), orgasm, and ejaculation, {{as well as}} maintaining normal menstrual cycle. The assessment of sexual dysfunction can be difficult due to the intimate {{nature of the problem}} and patients’ unwillingness to discuss it. Also, the problem of dysfunction is often overlooked by doctors. Atypical antipsychotic treatment is a key component of mental disorders’ treatment algorithms recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, the American Psychiatric Association, and the British Society for Psychopharmacology. The relationship between atypical antipsychotic drugs and sexual dysfunction is mediated in part by antipsychotic blockade of pituitary dopamine D 2 receptors increasing prolactin secretion, although direct correlations have not been established between raised prolactin levels and clinical symptoms. Variety of mechanisms are likely to contribute to antipsychotic-related sexual dysfunction, including hyperprolactinemia, sedation, and antagonism of a number of neurotransmitter receptors (α-adrenergic, dopaminergic, <b>histaminic,</b> and muscarinic). Maintaining normal sexual function in people treated for mental disorders can affect their quality of life, mood, self-esteem, attitude toward taking medication, and compliance during therapy.

40|$|Histamine is a biologically active amine (biogenic amine) {{that has}} a broad spectra of {{physiologic}} and pathologic reactions in the organism.

Whilst there is no information in scientific literature about the presence of <b>histaminic</b> receptors in smooth muscles of the small intestine wall of broilers (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), we tried to determine their presence, distribution and type in this kind of muscles. Investigations were carried out on isolated smooth muscles of the circular and longitudinal layer of the broiler small intestine (strip dimension 3 - 4 mm x 2 cm). The muscle strip was then placed in an isolated organ bath and the contractions obtained were registered with isometric transducers on a two-channel printer. This was done following the addition of histamine, betahistine (H 1 agonist), and mepiramine (H 1 antagonist). Muscle vitality was checked by adding acethylcholine chloride. Using the obtained results, it can be concluded that H 1 types of histaminergic receptors are present in smooth muscles of the small intestine of broilers. ...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to determine the mechanism of action underlying relaxation of vascular smooth muscle induced by ammonium ions. In particular, the possibility that these ions might be an endothelium-derived relaxing factor was examined. Rings of large canine femoral, mesenteric and coronary arteries and of small arteries from the gracilis muscle were suspended in organ chambers for the recording of isometric force. Membrane potential was recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in smooth muscle cells from the mesenteric artery. Ammonium ions induced relaxations which were independent {{of the presence of}} the endothelium. The relaxations were not prevented by adrenergic, serotonergic, muscarinic and <b>histaminic</b> blockers, by scavengers of oxygen-derived radicals or by inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase. The relaxations were prevented by a decrease in extracellular calcium concentration and by inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the relaxation induced by ammonium ions is related to changes in intracellular pH and, at high concentration of these ions, possibly to activation of the Na+/K+ pump. Ammonium ions are neither the endothelium-derived relaxing factor which activates guanylate cyclase nor the factor that induces endothelium-derived hyperpolarization. Inasmuch as relatively low concentrations of the ion induce relaxation of small arteries of skeletal muscle, they could contribute to exercise hyperemia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

A dose dependent potentiation of Ach response (anticholinesterase like effect) was found with ACAE and ACME at 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 mg/ml, but at higher dose of ACAE, ACME, ACAQE and ACHE (5, 20 mg/ml) inhibit the Ach response (antinicotinic effect). These results revealed biphasic effect of Acorus calamus leaves extracts on acetylcholine induced contractile response in isolated frog rectus abdominis muscle preparation (i. e. potentiation effect at lower dose and inhibitory effect at higher dose). Studies on isolated guinea pig ileum demonstrated antihistaminic effect in a dose dependent manner (100 - 1000 µg/ml) with ACAE, ACME and ACAQE. In addition, the dose dependent inhibition of Ach response (antimuscarinic effect) was observed with ACAE and ACME.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate a}} number of potential mediators of canine hepatic vein constriction, the key event in the DEC shock reaction in dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis. Using an isolated canine hepatic vein preparation {{it has been shown}} that α-adrenergic, H 1 <b>histaminic</b> and D tryptaminergic receptors are present. There is also evidence that M tryptaminergic receptors are located in this tissue. Bradykinin does not contract the isolated hepatic vein, while DEC in high concentrations causes a dose-dependent contraction which is not mediated through its known ability to release noradrenaline. In vivo experiments using pharmacological antagonists have confirmed that histamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline are not involved in this reaction. The reaction was not blocked by the endorphin antagonists naloxone and meptazinol. Dexamethasone, but not indomethacin however did block the reaction. Both anti-inflammatory agents act on biosynthetic pathways from arachadonic acid leading to the formation of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, respectively. However, since the dog is insensitive to leukotrienes it seems unlikely that these autocoids mediate the reaction. Therefore, it is postulated that the reaction results from the release, by DEC, of substances from microfilariae which are able to contract the hepatic veins either directly or indirectly and so induce hepatic venous congestion and hypovolaemic shock...|$|E

In the current randomized controlled study, we tested whether nocebo effects can be minimized by positive expectation induction with respect to electrical and <b>histaminic</b> itch stimuli. First, negative expectations about electrical itch stimuli were induced by verbal suggestion and conditioning (part 1 : induction of nocebo effect).

40|$|By {{analyzing}} the gene expression profile between tumor cells and revertant counterparts {{that have a}} suppressed malignant phenotype, we previously reported a significant down-regulation of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) in the revertants. In the present study, we derived, by using the H 1 parvovirus as a selective agent, revertants from three major solid cancers: colon, lung, and melanoma cell lines. These cells have a strongly suppressed malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. The level of TCTP is decreased {{in most of the}} revertants. To verify whether inhibition of TCTP expression induces changes in the malignant phenotype, in the classical, well established model of “flat reversion,” v-src-transformed NIH 3 T 3 cells were transfected with antisense TCTP. By inhibiting the expression of TCTP, the number of revertant cells was raised to 30 %, instead of the reported rate for spontaneous flat revertants of 10 - 6. Because TCTP encodes for a histamine-releasing factor, we tested the hypothesis that inhibitors of the <b>histaminic</b> pathway could be effective against tumor cells. We show that some antihistaminic compounds (hydroxyzine and promethazine) and other pharmacological compounds with a related structure (including thioridazine and sertraline) kill tumor cells and significantly decrease the level of TCTP.

Accessory sex organ weights, but not testis weight, were significantly reduced in the high dose treated groups. FSH levels were significantly elevated in both treated groups, but testosterone levels were unchanged. A high degree of variability characterized testis histology, with most tubules appearing normal and some tubules (15 – 17 %) partially lacking or devoid of germ cells. Morphometry showed that although seminiferous tubule volume was not significantly changed, the volume of peritubular tissue was reduced in the high dose group. There was extensive duplication of the basal lamina, lamina densa in both apparently normal spermatogenic tubules and se-verely damaged tubules. Apoptotic peritubular myoid cells were also found. TUNEL labeling confirmed extensive apoptotic cell death in peritubular cells, but revealed apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle.

This study therefore was a preliminary investigation of the ischuretic property and safety for use of a hydro-ethanolic extract of Amaranthus spinosus used traditionally in managing ischuria. Methods: Phytochemical screening, thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography were performed on the extract to establish fingerprints for identification. Acetylcholine, Nicotine, and the extract were applied to an isolated rat urinary bladder to ascertain contractile response. The possible receptor site(s) of action was also investigated using isolated rabbit jejunum, and guinea-pig ileum preparations. In-house observation, hematological analysis, and liver and kidney function tests were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats, in acute and sub-acute toxicity studies. Results: The extract had contractile effects on the rat urinary bladder (similar to acetylcholine and nicotine) and rabbit jejunum. Its contractile effect of the guinea-pig ileum was significantly inhibited by hexamethonium (77. 50 &# 177; 8. 50 %; P &# 8804; 0. 001) {{and to a lesser extent}} by mepyramine (49. 2 &# 177; 6. 80 %; P &# 8804; 0. 001) and Atropine (22. 45 &# 177; 5. 22 %; P &# 8804; 0. 01).

Tail flick latencies were obtained at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min. after drug administration. Naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered 10 minutes prior to test drug for testing antagonism. Observations : fluoxetine (5 and 10 mg/kg), mirtazapine (5 and 7 mg/kg) and venlafaxine (40 and 50 mg/kg) were found to have antinociceptive activity but not at lower doses. Escitalopram failed to show any antinociceptive activity at any of the doses used. The antinociceptive effect of all the drugs was antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg).

Both physiological and pharmacological results have demonstrated a critical role for voltage-gated sodium channels in many types of chronic pain syndromes. We tested the hypothesis that orphenadrine may block voltage-gated sodium channels. By using patch-clamp experiments, we evaluated the effects of the drug on whole-cell sodium currents in HEK 293 cells expressing the skeletal muscle (Nav 1. 4), cardiac (Nav 1. 5) and neuronal (Nav 1. 1 and Nav 1. 7) subtypes of human sodium channels, as well as on whole-cell tetrodotoxin (TTX) -resistant sodium currents likely conducted by Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 channel subtypes in primary culture of rat DRG sensory neurons. The results indicate that orphenadrine inhibits sodium channels in a concentration-, voltage- and frequency-dependent manner. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we further show that orphenadrine binds to the same receptor as the local anesthetics. Orphenadrine affinities for resting and inactivated sodium channels were higher compared to those of known sodium channels blockers, such as mexiletine and flecainide. Low, clinically relevant orphenadrine concentration produces a significant block of Nav 1. 7, Nav 1. 8, and Nav 1. 9 channels, which are critical for experiencing pain sensations, indicating a role for sodium channel blockade in the clinical efficacy of orphenadrine as analgesic compound. On the other hand, block of Nav 1. 1 and Nav 1. 5 may contribute to the proconvulsive and proarrhythmic adverse reactions, especially observed during overdose...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{suggested}} that {{differences between the}} behavioral effects of cocaine and analogs of benztropine {{were related to the}} relatively slow onset of action of the latter compounds. Several N-substituted benztropine analogs with a relatively fast onset of effects were studied to assess whether a fast onset of effects would render the effects more similar to those of cocaine. Only one of the compounds increased locomotor activity, and the increases were modest compared with those of 10 to 20 mg/kg cocaine. In rats trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline none of the compounds produced more than 40 % cocaine-like responds up to 2 h after injection. None of the compounds produced place-conditioning when examined up to 90 min after injection, indicating minimal abuse liability. The compounds had 5. 6 to 30 nM affinities at the dopamine transporter (DAT), with uniformly lower affinities at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (from 490 - 4600 and 1420 – 7350 nM, respectively). Affinities at muscarinic M 1 receptors were from 100 - to 300 -fold lower than DAT affinities, suggesting minimal contribution of those sites to the behavioral effects of the compounds. Affinities at <b>histaminic</b> H 1 sites were from 11 - to 43 -fold lower than those for the DAT. The compounds also had affinity for sigma, 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 (5 -HT 1), and 5 -HT 2 receptors that may have contributed to their behavioral effects. Together, the results indicate that a slow onset of action is not a necessary condition for reduced cocaine-like effects of atypical DAT ligands and suggest several mechanisms that may contribute to the reduced cocaine-like efficacy of these compounds...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 s and the {{beginning}} of the 1960 s, many desperate cluster headache (CH) patients came to the Headache Center of Florence, the only one in Europe at the time, to be examined. I was there… Horton’s headache era More than 60 years ago Graham and Wolff [1, 2] pro-posed the vascular theory of migraine and related vascu-lar headaches. At that time the clinical feature of the cur-rent CH syndrome was considered a migraine variant and therefore headache phase was attributed to painful dilatation and distension of the cephalic blood vessels. In 1939 Horton et al. [3] described cluster attack features, including increased temperature of the symptomatic side of the forehead and he reported the experience in treat-ing this new vascular headache syndrome with hista-mine. But only in 1956, when Horton detailed the pain and its associated symptoms, did the syndrome become generally known [4]. However, Horton focused on the symptoms of episodes, omitting a description of the peri-odicity of occurrences. Therefore he considered this syn-drome a vascular headache with chronic recurrent brief attacks similar to migraine. Horton used the term “hista-minic cephalgia ” [5] or “cephalalgia ” [6], as he attrib-uted this vascular painful syndrome to the potent vasodilator agent histamine. In many circles this form of headache has been called Horton’s headache in his hon-our. Apart from acetylcholine, at that time histamine was the only known vasodilatative substance capable of explaining the vasodilatation phase of the so-called vas-cular headaches. Horton focused on the presumed role of histamine as an inducing factor of CH attacks as well as their prevention with <b>histaminic</b> desensitisation, and ha...|$|E
40|$|Implanted {{biomaterials}} trigger {{acute and}} chronic inflammatory responses. The mechanisms {{involved in such}} acute inflammatory responses can be arbitrarily divided into phagocyte transmigration, chemotaxis, and adhesion to implant surfaces. We earlier observed that two chemokines—macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 —and the phagocyte integrin Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18) /surface fibrinogen interaction are, respectively, required for phagocyte chemotaxis and adherence to biomaterial surfaces. However, {{it is still not}} clear how the initial transmigration of phagocytes through the endothelial barrier into the area of the implant is triggered. Because implanted biomaterials elicit <b>histaminic</b> responses in the surrounding tissue, and histamine release is known to promote rapid diapedesis of inflammatory cells, we evaluated the possible role of histamine and mast cells in the recruitment of phagocytes to biomaterial implants. Using i. p. and s. c. implantation of polyethylene terephthalate disks in mice we find: (i) Extensive degranulation of mast cells, accompanied by histamine release, occurs adjacent to short-term i. p. implants. (ii) Simultaneous administration of H 1 and H 2 histamine receptor antagonists (pyrilamine and famotidine, respectively) greatly diminishes recruitment and adhesion of both neutrophils (< 20 % of control) and monocytes/macrophages (< 30 % of control) to implants. (iii) Congenitally mast cell-deficient mice also exhibit markedly reduced accumulation of phagocytes on both i. p. and s. c implants. (iv) Finally, mast cell reconstitution of mast cell-deficient mice restores “normal” inflammatory responses to biomaterial implants. We conclude that mast cells and their granular products, especially histamine, are important in recruitment of inflammatory cells to biomaterial implants. Improved knowledge of such responses may permit purposeful modulation of both acute and chronic inflammation affecting implanted biomaterials...|$|E
40|$|A {{satisfactory}} {{sex life}} requires {{an ability to}} socially interact with others, an understanding and accept ance of one’s sexual orientation, {{a certain level of}} self-confidence and adequately functioning sexual physiology (Box 1). Psychoses (primarily schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) are characterised by disorders in basic perceptual, cognitive, affective and judgemental processes. Those affected experience delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech and disorganised behaviour. It seems likely, therefore, that psychotic disorders will be associated with difficulties in sexual functioning, as they interfere with psychological and social interaction. Sexual dysfunction in psychosis Sexual dysfunction in psychosis involves a complex interplay of biological, psychological and social factors {{that may or may not}} relate to the underlying illness and its treatment. Some patients will require more specialist assessment and manage ment. However, the initial assess-ment should be undertaken by the treating psychiatrist, who is well placed to manage sexual dysfunction when caused by the drug treatment of psychosis, or to refer for specialist advice if this is indicated. Sexual dysfunction as a side-effect of drug treatment of psychosis Despite the improvement in interpersonal func-tioning that can be produced by antipsychotic drugs, there is evidence that people receiving medication for schizophrenia frequently suffer sexual dysfunction (Aizenberg 1995; Smith 2002). Gitlin (1994) lists four ways in which psychotropic medication can affect sexual function: • • direct effect on the central nervous system (CNS), e. g. the dopaminergic increase caused by levodopa, resulting in increased libido; • • indirect CNS effects, e. g. sedation secondary to <b>histaminic</b> effects of antipsychotics, resulting in decreased sexual activity; • • peripheral effects, e. g. α-adrenergic blockade, resulting in priapism; • • hormonal effects, e. g. dopamine blockade causes hyperprolactinaemia, which has negative effects on sexual and reproductive function. Reviewing whether the receptor-binding properties of the prescribed antipsychotic match the type of sexual dysfunction being experienced will assist in determining whether a patient’s sexual dysfunction is a result of their prescribed treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic granulomatous {{inflammation}} of the intestine was studied on the prejunctional modulation of cholinergic nerve activity in the mouse ileum. Contractions to carbachol (0. 01 – 0. 3 [*]μM) and to electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0. 25 – 8 [*]Hz) of enteric neurons were higher in inflamed ileum as compared to control ileum. However, when the neurally-mediated contractions to EFS were expressed as percentage of the direct smooth muscle contraction to carbachol, the responses to EFS were similar in control and inflamed ileum. Atropine (1 [*]μM) abolished all contractions to EFS and carbachol in control and inflamed ileum. DMPP (3 – 30 [*]μM), a nicotinic receptor agonist, induced concentration-dependent contractions that were more pronounced in inflamed ileum as compared to control ileum. Hexamethonium (100 [*]μM), a nicotinic receptor blocker, significantly inhibited the contractions to EFS in inflamed ileum but not in control ileum. In control ileum, histamine (10 – 100 [*]μM) and the histamine H 1 receptor agonist HTMT (3 – 10 [*]μM) inhibited the contractions to EFS concentration-dependently without affecting the contractions to carbachol. The inhibitory effect of histamine and HTMT was prevented by the histamine H 1 antagonist mepyramine (5 – 10 [*]μM) but not by the H 2 - and H 3 -receptor antagonists cimetidine and thioperamide (both 10 [*]μM). In chronically inflamed ileum however, histamine (10 – 100 [*]μM) and HTMT (3 – 10 [*]μM) failed to inhibit the contractions to EFS. The histamine H 2 and H 3 receptor agonists dimaprit and R(−) -α-methylhistamine {{did not affect the}} contractions to EFS in control and inflamed ileum. The α 2 -receptor agonist UK 14. 304 (0. 01 – 0. 1 [*]μM) inhibited the contractions to EFS in control and inflamed ileum without affecting the contractions to carbachol. The effect of UK 14. 304 was reversed by the α 2 -receptor antagonist yohimbine (1 [*]μM). The inhibitory effect of UK 14. 304 on contractions to EFS was of similar potency in control and inflamed ileum. Our results suggest that the prejunctional modulation of cholinergic nerve activity by nicotinic and <b>histaminic</b> H 1 receptors is disturbed during chronic intestinal inflammation whereas the modulation by α 2 -receptors is preserved. Such a disturbance of cholinergic nerve activity may contribute to the motility disturbances that are often observed during chronic intestinal diseases in humans...|$|E
