500|$|The {{premise is}} that the Naughty Sorceress has {{captured}} and [...] "imprismed" [...] (imprisoned in a prism) the Kingdom's ruler, King Ralph XI. The ultimate objective {{of the game is}} to defeat the Naughty Sorceress and free King Ralph. In King Ralph's absence, most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing, which gives quests to characters as they increase <b>in</b> <b>level,</b> <b>with</b> the final quest given when the character has reached level 13 and finished the other quests. [...] Players can also unlock quests from other sources, some of which are available only after ascending.|$|E
500|$|Secret of Evermore {{takes many}} of its {{interface}} and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana. The game mostly consists of an aerial view setting, in which {{the boy and his}} dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. [...] If the boy is currently selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence, and vice versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment, casting alchemy spells, or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game's Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0% and then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.|$|E

60|$|In {{the court}} in front were two {{worn-out}} millstones, made useful again by being let <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> the ground. Here people stood to smoke and consider things in muddy weather; and cats slept on the clean surfaces when it was hot. In the large stubbard-tree {{at the corner of}} the garden was erected a pole of larch fir, which the miller had bought with others at a sale of small timber in Damer's Wood one Christmas week. It rose from the upper boughs of the tree to about the height of a fisherman's mast, and on the top was a vane in the form of a sailor with his arm stretched out. When the sun shone upon this figure it could be seen that the greater part of his countenance was gone, and the paint washed from his body so far as to reveal that he had been a soldier in red before he became a sailor in blue. The image had, in fact, been John, one of our coming characters, and was then turned into Robert, another of them. This revolving piece of statuary could not, however, be relied on as a vane, owing to the neighbouring hill, which formed variable currents in the wind.|$|E
60|$|With {{trembling}} hands I lit a match. I {{had only three}} left, and we saw {{that we were in}} the angle of {{the far corner of the}} chamber, a fact that accounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place during our former exhaustive examination. As the match burnt we scrutinised the spot. There was a join in the solid rock floor, and, great heavens! there, let <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> the rock, was a stone ring. We said no word, we were too excited, and our hearts beat too wildly with hope to allow us to speak. Good had a knife, at the back of which was one of those hooks that are made to extract stones from horses' hoofs. He opened it, and scratched round the ring with it. Finally he worked it under, and levered away gently for fear of breaking the hook. The ring began to move. Being of stone it had not rusted fast in all the centuries it had lain there, as would have been the case had it been of iron. Presently it was upright. Then he thrust his hands into it and tugged with all his force, but nothing budged.|$|E

50|$|If the {{exercise}} {{is not done}} correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort {{it is important to}} make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward. This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat {{at the bottom of the}} pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> the seat.|$|E

50|$|If {{the player}} fails to {{intercept}} an approaching ball with the paddle (assuming {{that only one}} ball is in play, as is normal), the ball {{will return to the}} preceding level, at high speed. This backward journey will continue {{for as long as the}} ball is not intercepted by the player's paddle, so it is entirely possible for the ball to return all the way to the first level of the stage. If the ball is not intercepted at the first level, the player loses a life and must begin again from that level. However, completed levels remain completed, so the player's only task is to get the ball through the right-hand side. This is not always easy even after the level has been completed. In later versions, when the ball remains for too long <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> destroyed wall, the radiation bar will increase.

If she gets face to face with one of the monkeys, she can punch the monkey with a boxing glove. She can also punch and destroy apples if they're thrown <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>with</b> her gloves. Also, there are pieces of fruit that she can jump up and get for points. Additionally, {{there is at least one}} bell on each level that she can hit so that more fruits will appear.
