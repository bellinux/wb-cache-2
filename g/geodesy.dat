40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on {{four and five}} dimensional black holes and their associated <b>geodesies.</b> Some coordinate charts are presented, which are useful {{in the analysis of}} both static and rotating black holes, and their mathematical properties investigated before some methods of solving Einstein's vacuum field equations are examined. The Myers-Perry black hole metric is derived before going on to describe the Inverse Scattering Method of generating new vacuum solutions. The Inverse Scattering Method is used to generate the single and doubly spinning black ring metrics and then the physical properties of these solutions is explored in detail. The latter part of this thesis looks at different ways of visualising <b>geodesies</b> in various spacetimes and examines {{the pros and cons of}} each particular method, as well as looking at several examples of <b>geodesies</b> with different parameters. The <b>geodesies</b> of the singly spinning black ring are calculated and it is shown that they cannot in general be analytically integrated. In light of this, some restricted analytic scenarios are investigated with the intention of gaining some insight into how the <b>geodesies</b> behave in the spacetime as a whole. Finally, a method is presented which allows string charges to be added to any vacuum solution to Einstein's equations. The properties of this new charged solution are then compared with the neutral starting solution. The doubly spinning black ring is used as a model to demonstrate how the method can be used to charge up a specific black hole solution and the resulting thermodynamic properties of this charged doubly spinning black ring are then examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of <b>geodesies</b> passing through a point singularity of a Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that if the curvature does not blow up too rapidly near the singularity, then the singularity is at worst an orbifold singularity. The idea is to construct the exponential map centered at a singularity. Since there is no tangent space at the singularity, a surrogate is needed. We show that the vector space of radially parallel vector fields is well defined {{and that there is}} a correspondence between unit radially parallel vector fields and <b>geodesies</b> emanating from the singular point. 1...|$|R
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in <b>geodesy</b> and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} various methods by {{which one can}} extract (in detail) the metric structure of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime, using only information from the boundary. This is motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence, in particular the relation between geometrical properties of the bulk and certain field theory quantities such as "bulk-cone singularities" of two-point functions and entanglement entropy. These CFT quantities {{are directly related to}} endpoints of null bulk <b>geodesies</b> and regularised proper area of certain bulk minimal surfaces, respectively. Focussing initially on static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we demonstrate how the endpoints of null <b>geodesies,</b> and the endpoints (along with the proper length) of zero-energy spacelike <b>geodesies</b> allow us to reconstruct the bulk spacetime metric, and detail explicit iterative algorithms by which the metric functions can be extracted numerically using this data, to an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy. The stability of the methods is demonstrated both via examples, and by an analytic consideration of the errors. Refinements of the algorithms are presented, and we consider the differences in how the two types of geodesic probe the bulk. We focus on a realistic application of our methods, namely extracting the physical properties of a "star" in AdS, which leads to an analysis of how their total mass varies with their core density in higher dimensions. We find the existence of a critical dimension (dc) separating two distinct regimes of behaviour; monotonic for d > d(_e), and oscillatory for d < d(_c). Finally, we consider how our iterative algorithms can be generalised to metrics with less symmetry, and discuss possible directions for future research.

40|$|By using a {{suitable}} two-point scalar field, a covariant {{formulation of the}} Einstein pseudotensor is given. A unique choice of scalar field is made possible by examining the role of linear and angular momentum in their correct geometric context. It is shown that, contrary to many text-book statements, linear momentum is not generated by infinitesimal coordinate transformations on space-time. Use is made of the nonintersecting lifted <b>geodesies</b> on the tangent bundle, TM, to space-time, to define a globally regular three-dimensional Lagrangian submanifold of TM, relative to an observer at some point z in space-time. By integrating over this submanifold rather than a necessarily singular spacelike hypersurface, gravitational linear and angular momentum, relative to z, are defined, and shown to have sensible physical properties. © 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
