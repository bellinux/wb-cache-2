50|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic field}} holds the <b>hammer</b> <b>spring</b> in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field.

5000|$|The HP-SFS (Safe-Fast-Shooting) is {{a current}} {{variation}} on the Hi-Power Mark III with a modified firing mechanism. After the weapon is loaded, the hammer is pushed forward, which automatically activates the safety catch. When the shooter is prepared to fire, the safety is pressed down with the thumb, releasing the <b>hammer</b> to <b>spring</b> backwards into the usual, single-action position. A similar system is available for modifying Colt M1911A1s. Magazines are interchangeable with the Mark III and others.|$|R

5000|$|... 1) The firing cycle - The {{process that}} {{releases}} the gas that fires a paintball {{out of the}} marker is fairly simple compared to the re-cocking cycle. At rest, the bolt sits forward, closing the chamber (hence, closed-bolt). This prevents more paintballs from entering. A pull of the trigger drops the sear, which in turn releases the <b>hammer.</b> A <b>spring</b> propels the <b>hammer</b> forward into the valve, which causes the valve to release a burst of gas upward into the bolt. The bolt redirects the gas behind the paintball, propelling it out the barrel.|$|R

50|$|Developed {{especially}} for the U.S. government, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a USP DAO (Double-Action Only) model with a unique trigger mechanism. This mechanism improves the double-action trigger performance and reduces {{the weight of the}} DAO trigger pull to , uses a stronger <b>hammer</b> <b>spring,</b> and shortens the trigger reset. Aside from the LEM mechanism, it is identical to the USP Variant 7 (DAO) model.|$|E
5000|$|The HP35 {{originally}} had a rounded, serrated hammer {{with a hole}} through it (called a [...] "ring hammer"). This lighter hammer was harder to cock and had difficulty firing the harder Berdan-primed centerfire cartridges commonly used in Europe, often requiring a tightening of the <b>hammer</b> <b>spring.</b> This was replaced in 1972 by a spur hammer on both civilian and military models. However, the Browning Challenger and special variants of the Browning pistol still use the classic ring hammer.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis describes {{design and}} manufacture of airsoft spare parts. Selected spare parts were <b>hammer</b> and <b>spring</b> holder, which were designed in 3 D parametric software Autodesk Inventor 2016. Chosen method to manufacture spare parts, was Fused Modeling Deposition, {{which is part}} of Rapid Prototyping technology. The device for producing parts was 3 D printer uPrint. The manufacture of silicon mould was based on printed spring holder, which was used for parts manufacture, by casting plastic materi√°l. Thesis is completed with a technical-economical evaluation, in which {{it was found that the}} silicon mould casting is more profitable in the production of more parts...|$|R
50|$|These parts {{consist of}} a cam, mainspring, <b>hammer,</b> recoil <b>spring,</b> and the trigger group. It can {{also be noted that}} the hammer is {{designed}} at close to a forty-five-degree angle, whereas most handguns have a hammer that is made at about a ninety degree angle. This distinctive characteristic {{is due to the fact}} that the moving parts are in the mainspring housing which is located just underneath the slide instead of in the handle. This design also is key to the safety mechanisms of the pistol, which consists of a manual safety catch lever on the right side of the slide that stands in the way of the hammer hitting the firing pin.|$|R
5000|$|The Henry rifle used a [...]44 caliber {{cartridge}} with [...] {{of black}} powder. This gave it significantly less muzzle velocity and energy than other repeaters of the era, {{such as the}} Spencer. The lever action, on the down-stroke, ejected the spent cartridge from the chamber and cocked the <b>hammer.</b> A <b>spring</b> in the magazine forced the next round into the follower; locking the lever back into position pushed the new cartridge into the chamber and closed the breech. As designed, the Henry lacked any form of safety. When not in use its hammer rested on the cartridge rim; any impact {{on the back of}} the exposed hammer could cause a chambered round to fire. If left cocked, it was in the firing position without a safety.|$|R

LH channel sediments contained greater microbial biomass (100 -fold) and greater microbial diversity reflected by the 16 S rRNA clone libraries. Phylotypes related to methanogenesis, methanotrophy, sulfur reduction and oxidation were detected in the bacterial clone libraries while the archaeal community was dominated by phylotypes most closely related to THE ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota.

5000|$|By 1840 Wornum had {{improved}} his grand actions {{by adding a}} sustaining <b>spring</b> tying the <b>hammer</b> butt and {{the short end of}} the crank lever, intended to improve repetition and [...] "assist in the forte," [...] but eventually abandoned the inverted construction due to its inconvenient form and turned his attention instead to manufacturing [...] "overstruck" [...] or downstriking horizontal pianos, where the hammers are located above the strings. In 1842 he patented the application of mobile <b>hammer</b> return <b>springs</b> to downstriking actions for grands and squares, and included claims for a new disposition of the crank lever and escapement, as well as a method of operating the damper in uprights with a leather strip attached either to the hammer butt or to a wire fixed in the key.|$|R
50|$|The gas lighter {{is mostly}} {{cylindrical}} {{in shape and}} consists of a piezo-electric crystal over which a spring-loaded hammer is placed. The <b>hammer</b> and <b>spring</b> set up {{is attached to a}} button. When this button is pressed, the hammer is moved away from the piezo-electric crystal. When the button is pressed over a limit, the <b>spring</b> releases the <b>hammer.</b> The hammer hits the piezo-electric crystal. Due to piezo-electric effect, a high voltage is generated in the range of 800 volts. The lighter is wired {{in such a way that}} this whole voltage is applied in a small region of air gap between two metallic points. Due to high voltage generated, the air is ionized and acts as a path for the discharge. This electric discharge is the spark which when exposed to the combustible gas from the stove ignites it to produce flame. In gas lighters, piezo-electric ceramics like lead zirconate titanate also known as PZT are used due to their low cost and high sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1006 pistol was introduced, Smith and Wesson issued a recall on the {{one-piece}} plastic grip. It seems when the pistol was dropped on its heel, the plastic grip could break, allowing the <b>hammer</b> <b>spring</b> to fly free. Customers who contacted Smith and Wesson were sent new grips at no charge. Smith and Wesson {{did not ask}} for the bad grips to be sent back and these suspect grips are still showing up at gun shows to this day. The new replacement grip has a center punched mark {{on the bottom of the}} heel, whereas the bad grips did not.|$|E
50|$|The tumbler {{provides}} the automation. When reset, a provision is made {{such that the}} tumbler rod is cocked slightly, so that its resting position is skewed and the tip contacts the hammer mass {{on the face of}} the hammer slightly offset to the hole. This is commonly done by using a special bent end on the tumbler spring or using an out-of-flat face on the bottom end of the pin or top of the punch. It bears on the hammer mass and pushes it back against its spring as the punch is pressed, storing energy in the <b>hammer</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fairly {{standard}} in design, {{with respect to}} other single action/double action heavy frame revolvers, the key design difference between the FN Barracuda and other brands is the rapidly interchangeable cylinder, allowing the user to easily switch between 9√ó19mm NATO, [...]38 Special, and [...]357 Magnum calibers. The gun has a pinned barrel, five-screwed frame assembly, and an internal coil <b>hammer</b> <b>spring</b> that can be adjusted for trigger pull weight, among other details. The trigger pull for double action configuration, in factory settings, is 11 lbs, and is 4.84 lbs in single action configuration. Barrel length is three (3) inches, which is shorter than the typical revolvers of the era (usually four (4) inches) but longer than a snub-nosed revolver.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Shocker {{was one of}} the first mass-produced electropneumatic paintball markers on the market, effectively making it the [...] "grandfather" [...] of most markers used in tournament paintball today. Its closed bolt, hammerless design operated using two solenoids, rather than a <b>hammer</b> and <b>spring,</b> to open and close the valve and to cycle the bolt independently. Due to its large boxlike shape and significant weight, it was often referred to by the nicknames [...] "shoebox" [...] and [...] "brick". The {{first generation}} Shocker was manufactured by a company called PneuVentures and sold through Smart Parts. This marker was discontinued in 1997, when Smart Parts redesigned it and began producing the marker in-house until 2002. This marker became known as the Shocker Sport. The Shocker Sport was large, heavy, had a limited firing speed of 11.2 balls per second, and poor air efficiency when compared to other markers from the same time period.|$|R
5000|$|Sear Trip: Even with an {{electronic}} trigger, the Autococker still relies on a <b>hammer</b> and <b>spring</b> valve for firing. The electronic trigger controls the recocking pneumatics, and a sear solenoid. Thus, even electronic Autocockers have an amount of recoil and rate of fire some find unacceptable for serious play (though Autocockers are still seen in serious tournament play). In early 2006, the first fully electronic (valve and recock) electronic Autocockers were seen, made using the [...] "mQ valve" [...] (named after their inventor Mike Quinn). The valve only had a limited release cycle however, and became tied up in production and legal issues. A lack of steady supply of mQ valves caused prices to skyrocket on eBay, even for used or damaged ones. In mid-2007, the original creators announced that they had resolved the production issues and are now making new [...] "mQ2 valves," [...] which are mQ valves redesigned for greater reliability, flow, and consistency.|$|R
50|$|According to Fowler, North and Stronge, It is {{a delayed}} {{blowback}} operation, using a large external <b>hammer</b> and heavy <b>spring.</b> This operation {{is carried out}} by the unique design of the slide, which includes the extractor and the firing pin. Since the pistol is single action, the hammer needs to be cocked before it can fire a round. This is accomplished by the slide as it is pushed back from the gasses, which are expelled out of the cartridge once it is fired. Finally, as the slide moves back to the forward position, it chambers a new round.|$|R
5000|$|On August 24, 2004, SIG Sauer and Heckler & Koch/HK Defense won major pistol {{contracts}} with the United States Department of Homeland Security. The contract was valued at $26.2 million. The HK pistol models chosen were the HK P2000 US, HK P2000 SK Subcompact, and the USP Compact/LEM (Law Enforcement Modification). The LEM trigger is basically HK's version of SIG's DAK trigger and vice versa. According to the company, the LEM trigger allows for faster follow-up shots (repeat shots) on target than a standard double-action-only system, due to a lighter trigger pull (7.3-8.5 lbf) and shorter trigger reset than standard DAO trigger systems. The LEM trigger utilizes a two-piece [...] "pre-cocked hammer" [...] composed of a cocking piece and an external hammer. The hammer is pre-cocked when a round is chambered (slide is cycled). The LEM system supposedly also provides for more reliable primer ignition, since it utilizes a stronger <b>hammer</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The HK94/SG-1 (ScharfschutzenGewehr, [...] "sharp-shooting rifle") was {{designed}} for short-range sniping in built-up areas like cities or prisons. It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power , and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 √ó 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope. It had an overall length of 40.39 inches 1026mm and a weight of 9.25 lbs. kg. Its mean standard retail price (MSRP) in 1986 was US$1,525; {{this was more than}} twice what a stock HK94A2 (US$650) or HK94A3 (US$720) cost. Only 50 were imported into the United States; authentic models have serial numbers running in the 43XX range.As an aftermarket modification, a PSG-1 trigger pack with target pistol grip and match trigger could be added by a gunsmith by changing the ejector and <b>hammer</b> <b>spring.</b> The 6√ó Leupold scope was calibrated for [...]223 Remington rounds, so other scopes were often substituted.|$|E
5000|$|The GP100 was an {{evolution}} {{of an earlier}} Ruger double-action revolver, the Security Six. The first significant change was introduced with the Ruger Redhawk and that involved a new locking mechanism with a lever on the crane rather than using {{the end of the}} ejector rod to lock. Another change was the shape of the frame. Traditional revolver frames had exposed metal at the front and rear of the grips, with the frame determining the shape of the grips. This meant that to have a round butt concealed carry version and a square butt holster or target version of the same gun usually meant having two different frame shapes. The GP100 series, instead, used a small rectangular [...] "peg" [...] grip large enough to enclose the <b>hammer</b> <b>spring</b> and strut. The grips could then be any shape desired, {{as long as they were}} large enough to enclose the peg. This was not a new innovation having been used by Dan Wesson and, to some degree, by High Standard revolvers that predated the GP100. The Dan Wesson patent (...) was granted in 1972 and Ruger's patent (...) was granted in 1986.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, she {{was offered}} a role for a TV series, Paper Dolls. MGM decided to produce a weekly series based on the TV movie for ABC, {{recasting}} several of the original roles from the 1982 production. However, the series was short-lived and was canceled after 13 episodes. In 1986, she starred opposite Stacy Keach in The Return Of Mike <b>Hammer.</b> In the <b>spring</b> of 1987, Hutton had a starring role opposite William Devane in a sci-fi themed CBS Movie of the Week titled Timestalkers, that did well with both the critics' reviews and the TV ratings.|$|R
50|$|Upon discharge, the {{pressures}} {{created by the}} expanding gases actuates the slide-barrel assembly in the following manner: after traveling rearward a small distance, the locking block stops the rearward movement of the barrel and releases the slide, which continues its rearward movement. The slide then extracts and ejects the spent cartridge case while compressing the recoil spring (positioned horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of the receiver), and simultaneously cocks the <b>hammer.</b> The magazine <b>spring</b> forces the next cartridge up into line. At {{the apex of the}} recoil stroke the recoil spring acts to reverse the direction of the slide, chambering a fresh cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the hammer}} is pulled {{backwards}} the internal spring compresses, exerting exponential pressure against the hammer's continued backwards motion. As the <b>hammer</b> and <b>spring</b> mechanism reaches {{the far end}} of its backwards range of travel, it is caught and locked in place by a metal catching device known as the sear. The sear holds the hammer in place, allowing the kinetic energy of the bolt's forward motion to be released whenever the sear is depressed. As the trigger is pulled, the sear becomes depressed and allows the hammer to be propelled forward by the <b>spring.</b> The <b>hammer</b> collides with the valve releasing gas from the external pressurized tank into the internal bolt chamber. The ensuing burst of gas channels out {{the front end of the}} bolt, propelling the paintball down the barrel. The rest of the gas pushes backwards on the hammer, pushing both it and the bolt backwards until the mechanism is once again caught on the sear. Once caught, the hammer is ready to repeat the blowback process. In cases where the pressure from the storage vessel drops under the minimum required to complete the action's cycle, the marker may [...] "runaway" [...] firing rapidly without additional trigger pulls required.|$|R
