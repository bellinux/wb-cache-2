The service framework must also respect legacy systems.

The use of {{electronic}} prescribing systems (e-prescribing) have resulted in significant re-ductions in such errors. However, dealing with the heterogeneity of available information sources is still one of the main challenges of e-prescription systems. There already exists different sources of information addressing different aspects of pharmaceutical research (e. g. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical drug data, clinical trials, approved prescription drugs, drugs activity against drug targets. etc.). Handling these dynamic pieces of information within current e-prescription systems without bridging the existing pharmaceutical information islands is a cumbersome task. In this paper we present semantic medical pre-scriptions which are intelligent e-prescription documents enriched by dynamic drug-related meta-data thereby know about their content and the possible interactions. Semantic prescriptions pro-vide an <b>interoperable</b> <b>interface</b> which helps patients, physicians, pharmacists, researchers, pharmaceutical and insurance compa-nies to collaboratively improve the quality of pharmaceutical services by facilitating the process of shared decision making.

The evolving technological landscape, characterized by increasing technological capabilities of smart devices and their adoption by everyday users, the greater availability of digital information services and the emergence of smart environments with embedded digital artifacts point towards an emerging digital ecosystem where a significantly large number of users in inter-connected smart environments will be utilizing context-based services through different computational interfaces. The success of context-aware systems will depend on accommodating these emerging scenarios and meeting their wide-spectrum requirements will greatly influence their adoption. Specifically, these requirements include device and location independence during utilization of contextual services, reliability of the system infrastructure, scalability in terms of load, administration and geographic scale, and the performance of the overall system in terms of query-response times and quality of service. A cloud based context provisioning system will 1) allow access to context information through standardised and <b>interoperable</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which will facilitate device and location independence, and 2) provide reliability and scalability through elastic and redundant resources. However, simply enabling Cloud based provisioning will not utilize the temporal validity characteristic of the context data, which can exploit the principle of locality to improve query-response times and therefore positively influence the quality of service of the context-aware system as a whole. Keeping these expectations in view, this paper relates the delivery of the caching functionality through a Cloud based context provisioning system, but focuses primarily on establishing the suitability and relative effectiveness of different caching strategies for different types of contextual data. Once such effectiveness is established through experimental analysis, we analyse the performance of the caching strategies in a prototype Cloud-based context provisioning system.|$|R

However, they are very complex systems, in which a large number of components cooperates, posing a challenge to the desired efficiency, transparency and ease of access. Emerging technological paradigms such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Cloud Computing open up to {{a whole new set of}} possible applications for the infrastructure, or better ways to implement traditional services, but also introduce new environments to be controlled. One of the main challenges in delivering end-to-end service chains across multiple SDN, NFV and Cloud domains is to achieve unified management and orchestration functions.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The IoT concept has revolutionised {{the vision of the}} future Internet with the advent of standards such as 6 LoWPAN making it feasible to extend the Internet into previously isolated environments, e. g., WSNs. The abstraction of resources as services, has opened these environments to a new plethora of potential applications. Moreover, the web service paradigm can be used to provide interoperability by offering a standard interface to interact with these services to enable WoT paradigm. However, these networks pose many challenges, in terms of limited resources, that make the adaptability of existing IP-based solutions infeasible. As traditional service discovery and selection solutions demand heavy communication and use bulky formats, which are unsuitable for these resource-constrained devices incorporating sleep cycles to save energy. Even a registry based approach exhibits burdensome traffic in maintaining the availability status of the devices. The feasible solution for service discovery and selection is instrumental to enable the wide application coverage of these networks in the future. This research project proposes, TRENDY, a new compact and adaptive registry-based SDP with context awareness for the IoT, with more emphasis given to constrained networks, e. g., 6 LoWPAN It uses CoAP-based light-weight and RESTful web services to provide standard <b>interoperable</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which can be easily translated from HTTP. TRENDY's service selection mechanism collects and intelligently uses the context information to select appropriate services for user applications based on the available context information of users and services. In addition, TRENDY introduces an adaptive timer algorithm to minimise control overhead for status maintenance, which also reduces energy consumption. Its context-aware grouping technique divides the network at the application layer, by creating location-based groups. This grouping of nodes localises the control overhead and provides the base for service composition, localised aggregation and processing of data. Different grouping roles enable the resource-awareness by offering profiles with varied responsibilities, where high capability devices can implement powerful profiles to share the load of other low capability devices. Thus, it allows the productive usage of network resources. Furthermore, this research project proposes APPUB, an adaptive caching technique, that has the following benefits: it allows service hosts to share their load with the resource directory and also decreases the service invocation delay. The performance of TRENDY and its mechanisms is evaluated using an extensive number of experiments performed using emulated Tmote sky nodes in the COOJA environment. The analysis of the results validates the benefit of performance gain for all techniques. The service selection and APPUB mechanisms improve the service invocation delay considerably that, consequently, reduces the traffic in the network. The timer technique consistently achieved the lowest control overhead, which eventually decreased the energy consumption of the nodes to prolong the network lifetime. Moreover, the low traffic in dense networks decreases the service invocations delay, and makes the solution more scalable. The grouping mechanism localises the traffic, which increases the energy efficiency while improving the scalability. In summary, the experiments demonstrate the benefit of using TRENDY and its techniques in terms of increased energy efficiency and network lifetime, reduced control overhead, better scalability and optimised service invocation time...|$|R

The research program in progress involves designing and modeling a centralized remote laboratory brokerage system. More specifically, our work will focus on developing intelligent and user friendly adaptive interfaces required by those involved in remote laboratory environments, depending on the role each actor has to play during a laboratory session. These interfaces will provide individuals, either on site or geographically dispersed, with virtual access to the real tools and/or equipment {{they will need to}} use either individually or as part of a team. Our goals would be to a) propose pedagogical scenario models and tools for building interfaces for geographically dispersed users, while meeting the norms and standards for the learning objects; b) suggest mechanisms to allow for storing, tracking and retrieving the <b>interfaces,</b> <b>interoperable</b> resources as well as learning objects; c) suggest on-line laboratory managemen...|$|R
40|$|IEEE 802. 16 l- 01 / 13. We {{were very}} pleased to learn that your HIPERMAN group had {{reviewed}} our submission carefully and are happy to respond with more information. In particular, {{we would like to}} answer your question: “What is the IEEE 802. 16 definition of interoperability? ” While the Working Group maintains no formal definition of the term, we would generally defer to The IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms (IEEE Standard 100 - 1996). The appropriate definition therein is this one: The capability, promoted but not guaranteed by joint conformance with a given set of standards, that enables heterogeneous equipment, generally built by various vendors, to work together in a network environment. ” In particular, I note that, in IEEE 802. 16 l- 01 / 09, we responded positively to assessment of IEEE 802. 16 drafts with respect your criterion that “The standard, to be developed by ETSI Project BRAN, MUST support interoperability. ” In the case of IEEE 802. 16, our policy is to define multiple physical layers (PHYs) operating under a unified MAC layer. These PHY options address a number of different frequencies, with the intent to support many different regulatory domains throughout the world. Each of the PHY options is intended to support an <b>interoperable</b> air <b>interface.</b> While a mixture of PHY modes might not be interoperable with each other, the choice of any single mode is intended to result in full interoperability. I should note that we continue to consolidate our options where possible. For instance, at our Session # 13 of 14 - 18 May, we moved {{to reduce the number of}} PHY modes in our 10 - 66 GHz draft from two to one. For more details on this session, please see our repor...|$|R
