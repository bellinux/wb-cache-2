25|$|The Central {{then turned}} to other {{carriers}} outside of the Northeast, particularly the Chesapeake & Ohio which controlled the Baltimore & Ohio and the Western Maryland. The Chesapeake & Ohio was a very profitable coal carrier that has expanded into the Midwest. The Central saw the C as the perfect merger partner.

On paper <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> marriage. The NYC and the C/B complemented each other, whereas the NYC and PRR duplicated each other's efforts just about everywhere. Serious merger discussions were held between the NYC and the C, but those talks failed too when agreement could not be reached. With nowhere else to turn, the New York Central reluctantly restarted talks with the Pennsylvania in the early 1960s, which {{led to the creation of}} the Penn Central.|$|E
25|$|The series, {{particularly}} {{the first two}} films, has received significant critical acclaim. Scream has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 1990s by combining a traditional slasher film with humor, awareness of horror film clichés and a clever plot. Scream {{was one of the}} highest-grossing films of 1996 and became the highest-grossing slasher film in the world, an honor it still holds. Its success was matched by Scream 2, which not only broke box-office records of the time but was also considered superior to the original by some critics. Scream 3 fared worse than its predecessors, both critically and financially, with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in Scream. It did, however, receive some positive response, with claims that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> end to the trilogy. The film series has been the recipient of several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell and a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film for Scream.|$|E

500|$|Carter was {{inspired}} to write the scene in which Scully splashes water into Doggett's face, since {{he was aware that}} new actor Robert Patrick would be facing opposition from some members of the fan community. The scene was even the first filmed, in order to truly introduce Patrick to the show. After the conclusion of The X-Files television series in 2002, Patrick commented that this part of the episode had been his favorite scene in the series, and admitted that he could not think of a better way to introduce his character because the scene not only said a lot, but it had actually helped him. Tom Braidwood, who appears in this episode as long-running recurring character Frohike, similarly remarked that the first meeting of Doggett and Scully was one of his favorite scenes from the entire series. Both Robert Patrick and the director of this episode, Kim Manners, felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> introduction to the character of John Doggett {{as the leader of the}} taskforce sent to find Mulder.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio.

500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E

She also performed live at the German musical events Wave Gotik Treffen and M'era Luna Festival in 2007. She later released A Bit O' This & That: a rarities album of her covers, including songs from The Beatles and The Smiths, classical pieces, and her own songs.

2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans know that All My Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether you agree or disagree with her decision, you understand her rationale. That really is important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all {{important}} molecules {{in the body}} are proteins. Proteins work by each having a specific sequence of amino acids and a specific shape. Determining the order of amino acids is relatively simple. Finding the shape {{requires the use of}} x-ray crystallography and is anything but easy. It took a team of three researchers at Harvard, Don Wiley, Jack Strominger, and Pamela Bjorkman, eight years to ferret out the structure of the HLA protein. They worked specifically with HLA-A*02. Bjorkman did the majority of the leg work and in the seven years managed to piece together the structure of 90% of the protein. That last 10% was elusive though. It took another year of work to finally unveil the complete structure of HLA-A*02. They completed their work in the spring of 1987, discovering that the final 10% made a [...] "cup" [...] (of sorts) located on top of the molecule. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> size to hold peptides. Other researchers had previously determined that T-Cells can recognize cells infected with a virus, cells injected with a single protein from a virus, and even cells injected with pieces of protein from a virus. The discovery of the HLA protein structure made it starkly clear that the HLA proteins hold viral peptides in their binding groove. But the research team from Harvard wasn't done. They also observed that there was clearly a peptide in the binding groove of the HLA molecules they used to determine the shape. However, the cells they had extracted the protein from were definitely not infected by any disease causing viruses. The conclusion they made and the conclusion that has stuck to this day, is that HLA molecules can bind both self, and non-self peptides.|$|E
