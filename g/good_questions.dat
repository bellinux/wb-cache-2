[...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello dubbed [...] "Eggtown" [...] the best episode of the first four episodes of the fourth season. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard {{described}} it as a [...] "great episode" [...] and observed that it features [...] "the first conversation between Jin and Sun [...] season. [...] Interesting that last season so many fans were up in arms for the [...] because we didn't get to see enough of the other characters, and this season we're seeing even less of the others, yet no one is complaining. [...] Looks like the writers finally found the right balance." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen thought that the episode [...] "was all about moving all the simmering subplots forward so the next episodes can drive them home". [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! called the episode's final plot twist [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "unexpected". [...] Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones called it the best of the first four episodes of the season with four out of five stars, saying that [...] "the courtroom scenes were very well executed, with a marked difference in the characterisation of Jack [...] has become known as the trustworthy, honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed, so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad reviewed [...] "Eggtown" [...] positively, writing that it [...] "not many shows could mix topics like blackmail, grenades, and motherhood into one episode, but Lost pulled it off." [...] Jon Lachonis of UGO claimed that Lost [...] "again blew everybody's minds" [...] with [...] "Eggtown". [...] BuddyTVs Oscar Dahl commented that [...] "those last few forward scenes were genius.

[...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post thought that [...] "Eggtown" [...] "effectively kept up the frantic pace that this season has set, answering some really <b>good</b> <b>questions</b> while effectively bringing up new ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas is not {{the first}} quiet justice. In the 1970s and 1980s, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun {{generally}} were quiet; however, the silence of Thomas stood out in the 1990s as the other eight justices engaged in active questioning. The New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak has called it a [...] "pity" [...] that Thomas does not ask questions, saying that he has a [...] "distinctive legal philosophy and a background entirely different from that of any other justice" [...] and that those he asked in the 2001 and 2002 terms were [...] "mostly <b>good</b> <b>questions,</b> brisk and pointed." [...] Conversely, Jeffrey Toobin, writing in The New Yorker, calls the silence of Thomas [...] "disgraceful" [...] behaviour that has [...] "gone from curious to bizarre to downright embarrassing, for himself and for the institution he represents".|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} view among guidance advisors {{is that it}} is a {{good idea}} to visit colleges, preferably when college is in session and not during a summer break, with a chance to meet an actual student in the form of a tour guide, and taking notes for reference later when applying. Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit. A benefit is seeing a school as it really is—not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website. Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: [...] "can I see myself here"? Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and try to meet with them briefly or sit in on one of their classes. Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask <b>good</b> <b>questions</b> (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper. He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly. A follow-up [...] "thank you" [...] note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.) ...|$|E
