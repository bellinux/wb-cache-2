500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode about {{baseball}} for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

[...] "Aw, come on, Dolf", said the manager. [...] "He paid his way in--let him boo." [...] Just then the heckler spotted the rotund Robinson and yelled, [...] "Hey, fat belly!"

I wanted to get away from that. So I got down there (to New Orleans) and it was as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> famous <b>guy</b> had come to town, and I didn't want that. So I decided to do an album with a bunch of the musicians from down there, the music of New Orleans." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was a {{beneficial}} arrangement for Stigwood, and it effectively placed {{him at the}} pinnacle of the British pop industry in one step, but Epstein seems to have been about the only person in NEMS who was keen on the idea. Alastair Taylor is reported to have exclaimed [...] "You must be joking!" [...] when Epstein told him of the merger. Epstein was also considering handing over his role as manager of the Beatles, but when the Fab Four learned of this they were outraged. They evidently disliked Stigwood intensely. Interviewed in 2000 by Greil Marcus, Paul McCartney recalled the group's angry reaction:"We said, 'In fact, if you do, if you somehow manage to pull this off, we can promise you one thing. We will record God Save the Queen for every single record we make from now on and we'll sing it out of tune. That's a promise. So <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> buys us, that's what he's buying.'" ...|$|E

In January 1968, Beatles Ltd. officially changed its name to Apple Corps. Ltd. and registered the Apple trademark in forty-seven countries In February the company also registered Apple Electronics, Apple Films Ltd., Apple Management, Apple Music Publishing, Apple Overseas, Apple Publicity, Apple Records, Apple Retail, and Apple Tailoring Civil and Theatrical with the intent on focusing on five divisions: records, electronics, film, publishing and retailing.|$|E
5000|$|The Gale-Shapley {{algorithm}} {{involves a}} number of [...] "rounds" [...] (or [...] "iterations"). In the first round, first a) each unengaged man proposes to the woman he prefers most, and then b) each woman replies [...] "maybe" [...] to her suitor she most prefers and [...] "no" [...] to all other suitors. She is then provisionally [...] "engaged" [...] to the suitor she most prefers so far, and that suitor is likewise provisionally engaged to her. In each subsequent round, first a) each unengaged man proposes to the most-preferred woman to whom {{he has not yet}} proposed (regardless of whether the woman is already engaged), and then b) each woman replies [...] "maybe" [...] if she is currently not engaged or <b>if</b> she prefers <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> over her current provisional partner (in this case, she rejects her current provisional partner who becomes unengaged). The provisional nature of engagements preserves the right of an already-engaged woman to [...] "trade up" [...] (and, in the process, to [...] "jilt" [...] her until-then partner). This process is repeated until everyone is engaged.|$|R
500|$|In early 2010, an Afghan man {{approached}} the NDS claiming to represent senior Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. Offering a letter allegedly written by Mansour, he said Mansour was interested {{to open a}} channel for negotiations. Saleh's people started testing the credentials of the supposed messenger, and judged them to be false, closing the case. The man then approached other Afghan government institutions. Saleh recounts, [...] "When I learned ... {{that he was going}} through a different avenue, I warned the government that <b>if</b> it is <b>this</b> Aminullah, <b>if</b> he claims <b>this,</b> and <b>if</b> it is <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> trust me, he is not representing anybody; it's a scam. ... Be careful. This is not Mansour. But there was a perception that Amrullah is against talks, so let's sideline him." [...] The Afghan man, who lived in Pakistan where the Taliban's leadership council is based, subsequently held three meetings with NATO and Afghan officials. Having been flown from Pakistan to Kabul on a NATO airplane, the man met with President Karzai in the presidential palace. In late 2010, it turned out, that the supposed representative for Mansour was an impostor as Saleh had previously warned. The New York Times writes: [...] "In an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel, United States and Afghan officials now say the Afghan man was an impostor." ...|$|R

5000|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rotten Tomatoes {{gives it a}} rating of 82% based on reviews from 39 critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, Clear and Present Danger received a score of 74 based on 14 reviews. Noyce, who also directed [...] "Patriot Games," [...] manages to keep the complex story lines from snarling even though he relies heavily on crosscutting. The technique, which he uses ingeniously here, enlivens scenes that are technologically driven and potentially deadly. —Rita Kempley, writing for The Washington Post Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, commented how it [...] "delights in an almost boyish way in the trappings of power: rocket launchers and high-tech missiles, flags, ceremony and political double-speak."James Berardinelli, who wrote for ReelViews, remarked, [...] "Clear and Present Danger is all plot and no characters. The people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead. Jack Ryan is the most disappointing of all. He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter for good and justice, a Superman without the cape. I spent half the movie wondering <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> {{was ever going to}} show anything to mark him as vaguely human." [...] In Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy, author Matthew Alford formulated a critique of the film, pointing out that supporting characters like Cutter and Ritter are pointedly squeamish about the use of force. He queried, [...] "Where is this abundance of sensitivity from the US national security apparatus towards the people of Latin America in the real world?". He concluded, [...] "The answers are all too obvious, except to a Hollywood hooked on schmaltz, willfully ignorant of reality and in thrall to power." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 4 June, Oratorio {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} {{when he was}} one of four O'Brien-trained colts to contest the 226th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He started the 8/1 fourth favourite, but was never in contention and finished tenth of the thirteen runners, twenty-five lengths behind the winner Motivator. Oratorio was brought back in distance for the one mile St. James's Palace Stakes which, with Ascot Racecourse being closed for redevelopment, was run at York. Ridden by Fallon, he finished third of the eight runners behind Shamardal and Ad Valorem. Oratorio raced over ten furlongs {{for the first time in}} the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 2 July, when he was tested against older horses. The betting was dominated by Motivator, who started the 2/5 favourite, with his most serious opposition appearing to come from the New Zealand-bred five-year-old Starcraft. Fallon positioned Oratorio in third place as the lead was disputed by Motivator and Diomed Stakes winner Hazyview. In the straight. Motivator went two lengths clear, but Fallon produced Oratorio with a strong late challenge to catch the Derby winner 75 yards from the finish and win by half a length. Commenting the colt's improved performance, O'Brien explained [...] "the horse has taken a long time to get here because he is unbelievably calm. All he does is eat and sleep at home but racing is bringing him on. We would run him every week if we could. His run in the Derby was just a mystery. He just wasn't right." [...] Fallon, who received a two-day ban for improper use of the whip on the winner said [...] "I wasn't worried about the favourite. I thought <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> gives me his best he can win," [...] and also pointed out that the colt was very well suited by the course and distance.|$|E
