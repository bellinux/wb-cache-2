2500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} in 2001 that researchers {{have not found}} sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of stress hormones. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a “free access” maternity pen configuration in which sows are in <b>individual</b> <b>pens</b> {{for the first four}} weeks of pregnancy but can “unlock” the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the <b>individual</b> <b>pens</b> more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time. [...] Other researchers say the pigs' behavior does indicate chronic frustration. Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The Post(uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the European Union concluded that abnormal behavior in sows [...] "develop when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated. Hence their development indicates that the animal is having difficulty in coping and its welfare is poor." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2012, the National Journal {{took out}} of context {{separate}} quotes on gestation stalls from NPPC's communications director. A discussion with then-Journal reporter Ben Terris included a description of gestation stalls: [...] "So, our animals can't turn around for the 2 {{and a half years}} they're having piglets. They are moved to bigger farrowing, or birthing, pens for about a month each time they have a litter of piglets. Gestation stalls allow farmers to give sows individual care and feed rations and prevent aggression among sows, and animal scientists recognize these <b>individual</b> <b>pens</b> as the best system for housing pregnant sows. While the real motivation of animal-rights groups such as HSUS to banning gestation stalls is to raise the cost of producing pork as a way of reducing the consumption of meat, they claim they don't like gestation stalls because they're inhumane. I don't know who at HSUS asked the sow." [...] Terris used only the first and last sentences, juxtaposing {{them in a way that}} forced Neil Dierks, NPPC CEO, to issue the following: “On behalf of the National Pork Producers Council, I sincerely regret the recent comments in a news article that were attributed to an employee of the National Pork Producers Council. The comments were inappropriate and do not represent the views of our organization nor do they reflect the values of the hardworking American farmers who produce safe and nutritious pork for consumers around the world. Our nation’s pork producers take great pride in their long-standing commitment to the highest standards of humane care for animals. They are good people with good values.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the 1000 head grower/finisher swine research unit and how it addresses the research needs associated with the growing and finishing phases of pork production, including integration of manure studies with studies of other production variables.

The design of the facility allows for manure collection and feed delivery on an <b>individual</b> <b>pen</b> basis. Feed is delivered via a cart utilizing electronic scales to measure feed allocation to each pen. In the slatted portion of the barn, a separate manure cell is located under each pen. In the deep bedded portion of the barn, solid manure can be collected from each pen using a front end loader. Results to-date indicate that the design and location of the barn facilitates research into aspects of nutrition and manure management in pork production. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} reactivity {{to assess}} the temperament of Nellore steers in two feedlot housing systems (group pen or individual pen) and its relationship with plasmatic cortisol, 36 experimental units were observed five times at 28 -day intervals of weight management during a 112 -day feedlot confinement. A reactivity score scale ranging from 1 to 5 was applied when an animal was in the chute system. To the calmest animal, a reactivity score of 1 was ascribed and to the most agitated, 5. Blood samples were collected for cortisol analysis. No {{differences were found in}} reactivity and feedlot system. There was a relationship noted between reactivity and feedlot time in both housing systems (P < 0. 01). There was a relation between reactivity and cortisol levels for group animals (P = 0. 0616) and for individual ones (P < 0. 01). Cortisol levels varied among housing systems (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Housing {{lactating}} sows with piglets in a multi-suckling pen from around 14 days post-farrowing is {{common practice in}} Swedish organic piglet production. However, nursing-suckling interaction is less frequent in multi-suckling <b>pens</b> than in <b>individual</b> farrowing <b>pens,</b> thus affecting piglet performance, e. g., piglet growth. Moreover, piglet mortality is higher in systems using multi-suckling pens. Three management routines whereby {{lactating sows}} with piglets were moved from <b>individual</b> farrowing <b>pens</b> to multi-suckling pens at one, two, or three weeks post-farrowing were compared in terms of nursing-suckling interaction and piglet performance. Correlations between nursing-suckling interaction, piglet performance, and piglet mortality were also examined. In total, 43 Yorkshire sows with piglets {{were included in the}} study. Nursing-suckling interaction and all piglet performance parameters except piglet mortality did not differ between management routines. Piglet mortality in the <b>individual</b> farrowing <b>pens</b> did not differ between management routines, but piglet mortality in the multi-suckling pen was lower (P< 0. 05) when piglets were group housed at three weeks compared with one week post-farrowing. Overall piglet mortality was positively correlated with mortality in the multi-suckling pen for piglets group housed at one week (r = 0. 61 : P< 0. 05) and at two weeks post-farrowing (r = 0. 62 : P< 0. 05) but not for piglets group housed at three weeks post-farrowing.

40|$|Price {{variability}} among carcasses {{increases with}} a change from live-weight to dressedweight to grid pricing. Grid pricing has the largest price variability, because the price for each carcass is influenced {{by all of the}} components of the grid, rather than all cattle selling for the same live or dressed price. Therefore, producers selling on a grid need to have knowledge about the expected carcass merit of their cattle. We used data on 11, 703 head of cattle to determine which grid pricing components influence price variability the most and to measure how much price variability increases from grid pricing, relative to live and dressed pricing, at the individual-carcass and <b>individual</b> <b>pen</b> levels. The Choice-to-Select price spread has the largest influence on price variability per hundredweight, and average carcass weight had the largest influence on price variability per head. Whether price variability increased for both individual-head and individual-pen levels depended {{on the quality of the}} cattle sold and the grid on which they are sold. To manage the increased price risk created by pricing, producers must first manage that risk on an individualhead level through genetics, management, and sorting methods.
