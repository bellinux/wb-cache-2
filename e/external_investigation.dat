2500|$|On September 16, 2009, ACORN {{suspended}} advising {{new clients}} and initiated an independent review process, headed by Scott Harshbarger, an attorney from the Proskauer Rose firm {{and a former}} Massachusetts Attorney General. On September 16, Bertha Lewis, ACORN's CEO, froze admission to all of ACORN's service programs and instituted a review committee to implement organizational reforms. The independent <b>external</b> <b>investigation</b> found that {{while some of the}} counsel given by employees and volunteers was [...] "unprofessional and inappropriate", the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, [...] "in some cases substantially", and ACORN employees had taken no illegal actions.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, sexual {{harassment}} charges were leveled against Michael Oreskes, {{senior vice president}} of news and editorial director since 2015. Some of the accusations dated back to when he was Washington, DC bureau chief for The New York Times during the 1990s, while others involved his conduct at NPR. After a report on the Times accusations was published in The Washington Post, NPR put Oreskes on administrative leave, and the following day his resignation was requested. CNN's Brian Stelter reported that NPR staffers were dissatisfied with the handling of Oreskes, were demanding an <b>external</b> <b>investigation,</b> and that [...] Oreskes poisoned the newsroom atmosphere by abusing his position to meet young women.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to {{release of the}} first videos, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said on Fox News on September 20, 2009, [...] "n a way, this was good for us, so what it did was show up to us what weaknesses we have, and we have moved swiftly ... in order to correct that." [...] She said that after viewing the tapes, she had fired all the employees featured and had begun a comprehensive <b>external</b> <b>investigation.</b> As ACORN learned more from its employees of what had taken place, it called the videos [...] "false" [...] and [...] "defamatory". A spokesman accused O'Keefe of dubbing the audio on the videos. On September 23, 2009, ACORN filed suit in a Baltimore court against the filmmakers, citing [...] "extreme emotional distress" [...] of the ACORN workers and violation of two-party consent recording laws. It later allowed the suit to lapse.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986 and 1987, Congress {{passed the}} Pardon Laws, the Final Line and Due Obedience, which ended prosecutions of {{military}} and security officers for crimes committed during the military dictatorship. The Ley de Punto Final had been voted on 24 December 1986, under Alfonsín's presidency. It extinguished any charges for human rights violations for all acts preceding 12 December 1983. The military had pressed for the legislation under threat of another coup. Under the presidency of Carlos Menem, the military, police and left-wing guerrilla commanders accused of killings and torture during Argentina's [...] "dirty war" [...] of the 1970s could not be prosecuted for their crimes. These amnesty laws were long unpopular with surviving victims of the Dirty War and their families.

In 2005, the head of the Israeli National Security Agency, Major-General (res.) Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF's initial admittance of responsibility. In order to avoid negative publicity and a resulting backlash, the IDF did not conduct its own official, military investigation until 2007. On October 1, 2007, Israel officially denied responsibility for the shooting and claimed that the France 2 footage had been staged, prompting criticism from Al-Durrah's father.|$|R

The organization was secretive, and the Colonia was surrounded by barbed wire fences, and featured a watchtower and searchlights, and was later reported to contain secret weapon caches. In recent decades, <b>external</b> <b>investigations,</b> including efforts by the Chilean government, uncovered a history of criminal activity in the enclave, including child sexual abuse. As well, the findings include that its legal activities were supplemented by income related to weapons sales and money laundering. Bruce Falconer, writing in a piece entitled [...] "The Torture Colony" [...] (in The American Scholar), and referencing Chile’s National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation, has reported that a small set of the individuals taken by Pinochet's Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional during his rule were held as prisoners at Colonia Dignidad, some of whom were subjected to torture, and that some Colonia residents of the time were participants in the atrocities.|$|R

40|$|A point-by-point {{response}} {{is presented to}} Pendery et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) critique of the study “Individualized Behavior Therapy for Alcoholics (IBTA) ”. Two independent, <b>external</b> <b>investigations</b> have critically examined the original records from the IBTA study. The IBTA study compared two different techniques for treating poor-prognosis, chronic alcoholic state hospital patients. It was found that a broad-spectrum behavioral treatment oriented to controlled drinking was a more effective treatment than was the standard hospital treatment program based on conventional wisdom. The Pendery et al. critique gave the appearance of being a refutation by presenting findings for only one group of Ss in a comparative study. In this response, it is shown that the experimental and control Ss were justifiably classified as gamma alcoholics, that Ss {{were randomly assigned to}} groups, and that the two groups were comparable in terms of pretreatment characteristics. Moreover, as regards the originally reported 2 -yr treatment outcome findings, it is shown that Pendery et al, reported no specific events which were not already documented in the original study records which formed the basis for publications about the IBTA study. Finally, even in terms of long-term outcomes, i. e. mortality rates 10 – 11 yr after treatment, the experimentally-treated group (20...|$|R

50|$|Although under Kim Jong-il's {{rule the}} Central Committee {{apparatus}} underwent several reorganizations, some departments (mainly {{those responsible for}} internal and organizational party affairs: the Organization and Guidance, Propaganda and Agitation and Cadre Affairs departments) were left largely untouched. In contrast, departments responsible for overseeing the economy or South Korean affairs (such as the Administrative Department, which was reestablished in 2006 after {{being part of the}} Organization and Guidance Department since the 1990s) were frequently revamped. Although the United Front Department had its ups and downs during Kim Jong-il's rule, in 2006-2007 it was the centre of a purge. The Economic Planning and Agricultural Policy departments were abolished in 2002-2003 to strengthen cabinet control of the economy. Further changes occurred in 2009 with the establishment of the Film and Light Industry Industrial Policy departments; Office 38 was merged into Office 39 (and later reestablished), the External Liaison Department was moved from WPK jurisdiction to the Cabinet, while Office 35 (also known as the <b>External</b> <b>Investigations</b> and Intelligence Department) and the Operations Department were moved from WPK jurisdiction to the KPA Reconnaissance Bureau.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} impact of disciplinary sanctions imposed on Spanish auditing firms and their engagement partners. The disciplinary sanctions resulted from <b>external</b> <b>investigations,</b> which revealed misapplications of auditing standards. In particular, we evaluate (a) the efficacy of the external supervisory board in identifying low-quality auditors and (b) the effectiveness of the disciplinary system in improving the quality of subsequent statutory audits performed by the sanctioned auditors. We employ two earnings management indicators as proxies for audit quality: loss avoidance through extraordinary items and abnormal accruals. And we compare these measures in the financial statements of client companies (auditees) audited by sanctioned and non-sanctioned auditors between 1995 and 2007. Our evidence is mixed. The results show that companies audited by Non-Big 4 sanctioned auditors in the pre-inspection period are less likely to avoid bottom-line losses. Additionally, we conclude that use of this earnings management tool decreases in the post-investigation period for all sanctioned auditors, whether Big 4 or Non-Big 4 firms. Contrary to our expectations, the enhancement performance on this measure of audit quality is observed only for smaller fines. The discretionary accrual approach to earnings management does not offer significant results, however. Therefore, the conclusions are not robust, and further investigation is needed. A feasible explanation for the elusive conclusion may be based on the strong incentives for private firms to avoid bottom-line losses for financing purposes and to manipulate earnings to minimize tax payments...|$|R
