25|$|The {{conversion}} of the Norden company's New York City <b>engineering</b> <b>lab</b> to a production factory was a long process. Before the war, skilled craftsmen, most of them German or Italian immigrants, hand-made almost {{every part of the}} 2,000-part machine. Between 1932 and 1938, the company produced only 121 bombsights per year. During the first year after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Norden produced 6,900 bombsights, three-quarters of which went to the Navy.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{contract was}} signed {{in the aftermath of}} Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium ordering the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets. The Americans were obliged to use subcontractors from these countries in areas where they were competitive. Norsk Data put its eye on the simulator, as only two other manufacturers, Interdata and System <b>Engineering</b> <b>Lab,</b> had previously built similar systems. Norsk Data originally cooperated with the small simulator manufacturer Hydrosystems, but this spurred Singer Link, the world's largest manufacturer, to investigate ND's systems. In the end, three of four simulator contenders bid with ND-based systems and the contract was awarded Singer Link.|$|E
25|$|The University's College of Engineering also {{houses the}} NSF EUV ERC, or the Engineering Research Center. This {{facility}} has connections to UC Berkley and CU Boulder, and researches Extreme Ultraviolets.

25|$|A celebrated {{engineer}} in his era, Brunel remains revered today, {{as evidenced by}} numerous monuments to him. There are statues in London at Temple (pictured), Brunel University and Paddington station, and in Bristol, Plymouth, Swindon, Milford Haven and Saltash. A statue in Neyland in Pembrokeshire in Wales was stolen in August 2010. The topmast of the Great Eastern {{is used as a}} flagpole at the entrance to Anfield, Liverpool Football Club's ground. Contemporary locations bear Brunel's name, such as Brunel University in London, shopping centres in Swindon and also Bletchley, Milton Keynes, and a collection of streets in Exeter: Isambard Terrace, Kingdom Mews, and Brunel Close. A road, car park, and school in his home city of Portsmouth are also named in his honour, along with one of the city's largest public houses. There is an <b>engineering</b> <b>lab</b> building at the University of Plymouth named in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Rose–Hulman {{has four}} main {{classroom}} buildings plus a library, a mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>lab,</b> and an administration building. The four main buildings are Moench Hall (houses Physics and Optical Engineering, Engineering Management, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering) Olin Hall, Crapo Hall, and Myers Hall. Olin came {{as a result of}} a proposal by Sam Hulbert and was later expanded to add eight more advanced learning classrooms. Olin includes a large occupancy by the Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments. Crapo is home to the Mathematics Department and has two floors of classrooms. The John T. Myers Center for Technological Research with Industry, the newest academic building, holds the Graduate Studies Office and some Bioengineering Department labs. The lower floor of Meyers hall has been renovated adding new high-tech classrooms to facilitate the growing number of classes offered at Rose. The largest, Moench Hall, is composed of four floors of classrooms, offices, and labs, and was the original academic building on campus built in 1922. All of the remaining departments have offices in Moench.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Richards Presidency, under the {{leadership}} of engineer, lawyer, and naturalist, Henry Sturgis Drinker ('71) (1905–1920) Lehigh witnessed strong growth, with the construction of the John Fritz <b>Engineering</b> <b>Lab</b> (1910), and Taylor Gym (1914). Furthermore, plans were made for the Gothic inspired Alumni Memorial Building, designed by alumni T. C. Visscher ('99) and J. L. Burley ('94). This was an elaborate project that would not be finished until the Richards Presidency. During Richards, Lehigh was not too negatively affected by the Depression, thanks to its stronger standing, good management, and the support of Bethlehem Steel. Internal development of the three undergraduate Colleges was emphasized. And critically, just before the Depression, two massive, and coterminous, projects were completed, lending the University much of its modern appearance. The first was a large addition to Linderman Library, doubling its size, and granting a Gothic reinterpretation to what was a Romanesque structure (1929); and secondly, Packard Lab (1929). Both enlargements of the Campus were designed by the firm of Visscher and Burley, again Gothic, with the latter accomplished through the generous gifts of James Ward Packard ('84), founder of the motor company.|$|E

500|$|The {{water quality}} has also {{deteriorated}} due to intense pollution {{caused by the}} untreated sewage and solid waste that is fed into the lake from the peripheral areas and from the settlements and houseboats. Besides, some experts like Dr. A.A. Kazmi (Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee and {{in charge of the}} Environmental <b>Engineering</b> <b>Lab)</b> believe that deforestation in the catchment of Dal and Telbal stream may have led to more nitrogen and phosphorus-rich run-off, further aiding eutrophication. [...] Encroachments of water channels and consequent clogging has diminished the circulation and inflows into the lake, so with the building up of phosphates and nitrogen, this has led to extensive weed growth and consequences on the biodiversity of the lake.|$|E
