500|$|The {{front cover}} for Marquee Moon {{was shot by}} {{photographer}} Robert Mapplethorpe, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith's 1975 album Horses. His photo situated Verlaine a step {{in front of the}} rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his right <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> body and extended his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more [...] "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed". He likened the process to Andy Warhol's screen prints. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith had framed and kept for himself.|$|E

6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog once more. Then {{he folded}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> white and yellow {{waistcoat}} and began again {{to dream of}} {{the days when the}} frogs had long tails and ruled the world.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused a}} little; then {{kneeling}} in the pulpit's bows, folded <b>his</b> large brown <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, uplifted his closed eyes, {{and offered a}} prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying {{at the bottom of}} the sea.|$|R
60|$|Dr PorhoÃ«t {{passed his}} <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{and for a}} little while there was silence.|$|E

60|$|One {{morning the}} Merry Little Breezes found Grandfather Frog sitting as usual on his big green lily-pad, {{and they knew}} {{by the way he}} folded <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> white and yellow {{waistcoat}} that it was full of foolish green flies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{sympathize with}} that fellow," [...] murmured Pepper, as he slapped <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, {{trying to get}} up more circulation. Then he walked around the room, reading another doggerel or two. Finally he drew out a lead pencil.|$|R
6000|$|I {{moved like}} {{a man in a}} dream. It was all incredible, benumbing. Tenderly I {{disposed}} his head on its pillow and drew <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast. [...] "Here is the end of a good man," [...] I said. [...] "Another soldier of the Union mustered out." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped short. He {{passed his}} <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> forehead. All {{the time the}} woman {{remained}} unmoved.|$|E
