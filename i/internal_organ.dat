5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} to what extent fifth grade students located the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of human body. Study group consisted of 150 students at two primary schools in Balıkesir in northwest of Turkey during the fall term of 2011 - 2012 academic years. Data were collected by Locate <b>Internal</b> <b>Organs</b> Questionnaire consisting of two open-ended questions. In the first question (written question), the names with numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body were given to the students and the students were asked to locate the numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of the human body. In the second question (written-visual question), the names and images with numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body were given to the students and the students were asked to locate the numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of the human body. The data was analyzed by descriptive analysis method. The study results revealed that the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body signed the most correctly were esophagus, trachea, lungs on the outline of the human body for the written and written-visual questions, while the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body signed the least correctly were spleen, pancreas, intestines for both of the questions. The students’ total correct answers were mostly at the category of partly right to both written and written-visual questions.

25|$|Despite the {{rarity of}} {{complete}} fossils, these very rare intact specimens do {{allow us to}} gain an insight into the <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> arrangement of the Thelodonts.

Further, these fossils allowed the gut morphology to be interpreted, which generated much excitement: their guts were unlike those of any other agnathans, and a stomach was clearly visible: this was unexpected, as it was previously thought that stomachs evolved after jaws. Distinctive fork-shaped tails - usually characteristic of the jawed fish (gnathostomes) - were also found, linking the two groups to an unexpected degree.|$|E

25|$|The {{catheter}} {{is itself}} {{designed to be}} radiodense for visibility and it allows a clear, watery, blood compatible radiocontrast agent, commonly called an X-ray dye, to be selectively injected and mixed with the blood flowing within the artery. Typically 3–8 cc of the radiocontrast agent is injected for each image to make the blood flow visible for about 3–5 seconds as the radiocontrast agent is rapidly washed away into the coronary capillaries and then coronary veins. Without the X-ray dye injection, the blood and surrounding heart tissues appear, on X-ray, as only a mildly-shape-changing, otherwise uniform water density mass; no details of the blood and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> structure are discernible. The radiocontrast within the blood allows visualization of the blood flow within the arteries or heart chambers, depending on where it is injected.|$|E

25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.|$|E
25|$|Objects {{struck by}} {{lightning}} experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk. As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt, forming tubular structures called fulgurites. Even though roughly 90 percent of people {{struck by lightning}} survive, humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> and nervous system damage. Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves {{an important role in}} the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Spencer again brings forward this difficulty, {{as he did}} in his Principles of Biology {{twenty-five years}} ago, and urges that all the {{adjustments}} of bones, muscles, blood-vessels, and nerves which would be required during, for example, the development of the neck and fore-limbs of the giraffe, could not have been effected by [...] "simultaneous fortunate spontaneous variations." [...] But this difficulty is fully disposed of by the facts of simultaneous variation adduced in our third chapter, and has also been specially considered in Chapter VI, p. 127. The best answer to this objection may, perhaps, be found {{in the fact that the}} very thing said to be impossible by variation and natural selection has been again and again effected by variation and artificial selection. During the process of formation of such breeds as the greyhound or the bulldog, of the race-horse and carthorse, of the fantail pigeon or the otter-sheep, many co-ordinate adjustments have been produced; and no difficulty has occurred, whether the change has been effected by a single variation--as in the last case named--or by slow steps, as in all the others. It seems to be forgotten that most animals have such a surplus of vitality and strength for all the ordinary occasions of life that any slight superiority in one part can be at once utilised; while the moment any want of balance occurs, variations in the insufficiently developed parts will be selected to bring back the harmony of the whole organisation. The fact that, in all domestic animals, variations do occur, rendering them swifter or stronger, larger or smaller, stouter or slenderer, and that such variations can be separately selected and accumulated for man's purposes, is sufficient to render it certain that similar or even greater changes may be effected by natural selection, which, as Darwin well remarks, [...] "acts on every <b>internal</b> <b>organ,</b> on every shade of constitututional difference, on the whole machinery of life." [...] The difficulty as to co-adaptation of parts by variation and natural selection appears to me, therefore, to be a wholly imaginary difficulty which has no place whatever in the operations of nature.|$|E
60|$|Domestic {{varieties}} as {{a general}} rule certainly differ from one another in less important parts than do species; and when important differences occur, they are seldom firmly fixed; but this fact is intelligible, if we consider man's method of selection. In the living animal or plant he cannot observe internal modifications in the more important organs; nor does he regard them {{as long as they are}} compatible with health and life. What does the breeder care about any slight change in the molar teeth of his pigs, or for an additional molar tooth in the dog; or for any change in the intestinal canal or other <b>internal</b> <b>organ?</b> The breeder cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat, and for an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep, and this he has effected. What would the floriculturist care for any change in the structure of the ovarium or of the ovules? As important internal organs are certainly liable to numerous slight variations, and as these would probably be transmitted, for many strange monstrosities are inherited, man could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in these organs. When he has produced any modification in an important part, he has generally done so unintentionally, in correlation with some other conspicuous part. For instance, he has given ridges and protuberances to the skulls of fowls, by attending to the form of the comb, or to the plume of feathers on the head. By attending to the external form of the pouter-pigeon, he has enormously increased the size of the oesophagus, and has added to the number of the ribs, and given them greater breadth. With the carrier-pigeon, by increasing through steady selection the wattles on the upper mandible, he has greatly modified the form of the lower mandible; and so in many other cases. Natural species, on the other hand, have been modified exclusively for their own good, to fit them for infinitely diversified conditions of life, to avoid enemies of all kinds, and to struggle against a host of competitors. Hence, under such complex conditions, it would often happen that modifications of the most varied kinds, in important as well as in unimportant parts, would be advantageous or even necessary; and they would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of the fittest. Still more important is the fact that various indirect modifications would likewise arise through the law of correlated variation.|$|E
