2500|$|For platinum, gold, {{and silver}} jewellery, {{there are many}} {{techniques}} to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery {{is the most common}} and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving [...] "brush strokes". <b>Hammered</b> <b>finishes</b> are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.|$|R

25|$|Soft <b>hammer</b> <b>finished</b> {{pieces are}} usually balanced, {{symmetrical}} {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.|$|R
