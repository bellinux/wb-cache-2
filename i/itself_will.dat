5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by <b>itself,</b> <b>will</b> not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto {{with any degree of}} accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} to begin again in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan. The People's Republic of China {{announced that it would}} not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared <b>itself</b> <b>willing</b> to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|R

40|$|The Panama Canal {{represented}} America’s {{first great}} achievement {{on the international}} stage. But in its triumph, the United States showed <b>itself</b> <b>willing</b> to pursue success {{on the backs of}} the laborers—most of them black—without whom the canal could not have become a reality. This paper focuses on these men—men who braved dangerous conditions and the institutionalized segregation of the Canal Zone despite America’s reluctance to confront the issue of racism over a group of non-citizen, non-white laborers hundreds of miles removed from any American city or shore...|$|R
50|$|The Aznar Government {{maintained}} {{the commitment of}} the previous government to join the European Union's single currency and showed <b>itself</b> <b>willing</b> to take political risks {{in order to meet the}} requirements for membership. In the middle of 1996 it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall, despite a series of union-led demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of Spaniards throughout the nation on 11 December.|$|R

25|$|I must, however, {{make clear}} what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a {{recognised}} creed.

25|$|Fitch Ratings {{stated that}} the {{approval}} of the Panama Canal expansion referendum could yield positive results for the country in the long term in terms of higher external and fiscal receipts and GDP growth prospects. However, the referendum <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> not have an immediate impact on Panama's sovereign ratings, as uncertainties remain about debt financing, future revenues from tolls, and Panama's ongoing fiscal consolidation.|$|E

25|$|The current {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} tilt, by <b>itself,</b> <b>will</b> promote milder seasons (warmer winters and colder summers), {{as well as}} an overall cooling trend. Because most of the planet's snow and ice lies at high latitude, decreasing tilt may encourage the onset of an ice age for two reasons: There is less overall summer insolation, and also less insolation at higher latitudes, which melts less of the previous winter's snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|Water resistance: The skin {{acts as a}} water {{resistant}} barrier so essential nutrients aren't washed out of the body. The nutrients and oils that help hydrate the skin are covered by the most outer skin layer, the epidermis. This is helped {{in part by the}} sebaceous glands that release sebum, an oily liquid. Water <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> not cause the elimination of oils on the skin, because the oils residing in our dermis flow and would be affected by water without the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|Since a {{pacemaker}} uses batteries, {{the device}} <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> need replacement as the batteries lose power. Device replacement {{is usually a}} simpler procedure than the original insertion as it does not normally require leads to be implanted. The typical replacement requires a surgery in which an incision is made to remove the existing device, the leads are removed from the existing device, the leads {{are attached to the}} new device, and the new device is inserted into the patient's body replacing the previous device.|$|E

25|$|Possibility {{of insulin}} pump malfunctioning, {{and having to}} resort back to {{multiple}} daily injections until a replacement becomes available. However most pump manufacturers will usually have a program that will get a new pump to the user within 24 hours or allow the user to buy a second pump as a backup for a small fee. Additionally the pump <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> make many safety checks throughout the day, in some cases up to 4,000,000 and may have a second microprocessor dedicated to this.|$|E
25|$|Josiah Crackenthorpe, {{purveyor}} of tea biscuits, built Rutherford Hall in 1884. His son, Luther, now a semi-invalid widower, had displayed spendthrift qualities in his youth. To preserve the family fortune, Josiah has left his considerable fortune in trust, the income from {{which is to}} be paid to Luther for life. After Luther's death, the capital is to be divided equally among Luther's children. Luther Crackenthorpe is merely the trustee of Rutherford Hall and hence, according to the will, cannot sell the house. The house <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> be inherited by Luther Crackenthorpe's eldest surviving son or his issue.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{infrared}} observations {{had been}} made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.|$|E

25|$|The Midland Metro is a light-rail/tram line in {{the county}} of West Midlands, England, {{operating}} between the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton via the towns of West Bromwich and Wednesbury. The line operates on streets in urban areas, and reopened conventional rail tracks that link the towns and cities. The owners are Transport for West Midlands with operation by National Express Midland Metro, a subsidiary of National Express. TfWM <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> operate the service from October 2018.

25|$|On September 10, 2008, The Detroit News {{reported}} that Smith Terminal <b>itself</b> <b>will</b> not be demolished because the airport authority offices {{remain on the}} upper floors. However, the Detroit Free Press of October 9, 2008, stated that maintaining the terminal in its present condition would cost upwards of $4 million annually in utilities, a sore spot for airlines at DTW who foot the bill, in part, through airport landing fees; the airlines were hoping for a greater cost savings once the Smith and Berry terminals were decommissioned. On May 20, 2009, the airport authority formally voted to totally vacate the Berry Terminal, while using the L.C. Smith Terminal for its offices.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{exist that}} {{currently}} prevent a shift {{over to a}} 100% renewable technologies. There is debate over {{the environmental impact of}} solar power, and the environmental impact of wind power. Some argue that the pollution produced and requirement of rare earth elements offsets many of the benefits compared to other alternative power sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints. However, according to a research paper published in 2014, renewable energy by <b>itself,</b> <b>will</b> not be able to stop climate change.|$|E
