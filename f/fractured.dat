30|$|Femoral trochanteric <b>fracture</b> is a {{very common}} injury (Nikkel et al. 2012; Kannus et al. 1996). However, in the {{so-called}} femoral trochanteric <b>fracture,</b> a <b>fracture</b> whose <b>fracture</b> line extends to the basal neck or the subtrochanteric part is not rare. A <b>fracture</b> extending from the basal neck to the subtrochanteric part is included among so-called femoral trochanteric <b>fractures.</b> Such <b>fractures</b> have high instability, and the treatment method {{is different from that}} for femoral trochanteric <b>fractures</b> within only the trochanteric zone. Nevertheless, we cannot classify such <b>fractures</b> conventionally because the <b>fractures</b> cross the target range of the conventional classification: femoral neck <b>fracture,</b> basicervical <b>fracture,</b> pertrochanteric <b>fracture,</b> or subtrochanteric <b>fracture.</b> Therefore, the choice of internal fixator for such <b>fractures</b> around the femoral trochanter is very difficult. Thus, area classification has been proposed as a comprehensive classification that can identify such <b>fractures</b> (Kijima et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> propagation model to describe propagation more realistically. In propagating the hydraulic <b>fractures,</b> {{we have used}} two criteria: maximum tangential stress to determine the <b>fracture</b> initiation angle and whether a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> intersects a natural <b>fracture.</b> The model was validated for the parameters relevant to <b>fracture</b> propagation, such as initiation angle and crossing ability through natural <b>fracture.</b> In order to check whether a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> crosses a natural <b>fracture,</b> the model results on crossing state excellently matched with the experimental data. In the sensitivity analysis for direction of maximum horizontal stress, frictional coefficient of <b>fracture</b> interface, and natural <b>fracture</b> orientation, {{the results show that}} hydraulic <b>fracture</b> intersects natural <b>fracture,</b> and then, propagated suitably with theoretical results according to <b>fracture</b> interaction criterion. In comparison of this model against vertical <b>fracture</b> approach, it was ascertained that there are discrepancies in <b>fracture</b> connectivity and stimulated reservoir volume. ? ??? 2015 ?? ??????? ??? ??? ?????(?????? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ???? ??) ...|$|R
30|$|With a lower {{horizontal}} stress difference, {{the natural}} <b>fractures</b> {{could easily be}} opened by hydraulic <b>fractures,</b> and then form branch <b>fractures.</b> Finally, the hydraulic <b>fractures</b> connect with the natural <b>fractures</b> to form a complex <b>fracture</b> network system. With {{an increase in the}} horizontal stress difference, the SRV is reduced and the average <b>fracture</b> length is increased. When the horizontal stress difference is higher than 6  MPa, the <b>fracture</b> geometry changes from a complex <b>fracture</b> network to planar <b>fractures,</b> which causes a reduction in the SRV and an increase in the <b>fracture</b> length. The horizontal stress difference of the target formation is 3 – 5  MPa. It is beneficial to form a complex <b>fracture</b> network by volumetric <b>fracturing.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of dense spacing <b>fracture</b> network {{is crucial to}} the hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> treatment of unconventional reservoir. However, one difficulty for <b>fracturing</b> treatment is the lack of clear understanding on the nature of <b>fracture</b> complexity created during the treatment. In this paper, <b>fracture</b> propagation is numerically investigated to find the conditions needed for the stable propagation of complex <b>fracture</b> network. Firstly, starting from a parallel <b>fracture</b> system, the stability of <b>fracture</b> propagation is analyzed and a dimensionless number M is obtained. Then, by developing a hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> simulation model based on displacement discontinuity method, the propagation of parallel <b>fractures</b> is simulated and a clear relation between M and the stability of parallel <b>fractures</b> is obtained. Finally, the investigation on parallel <b>fractures</b> is extended to complex <b>fracture</b> networks. The propagation of complex <b>fracture</b> networks is simulated and the results show that the effects of M on complex <b>fracture</b> networks is the same to that of parallel <b>fractures.</b> The clear relation between M and <b>fracture</b> propagation stability is important for the optimization of hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> operation...|$|R

30|$|Results {{showed that}} the {{viscosity}} and injection rate of the <b>fracturing</b> fluid had important influences on the <b>fracture</b> propagation and penetration. Appropriate viscosity and injection rate could ensure large vertical <b>fracture</b> propagation height and formation of complex <b>fracture</b> networks in the coal seam. When the viscosity or injection rate of the <b>fracturing</b> fluid was too small, leakage would occur along the weak plane, forming multiple <b>fractures,</b> which is not conducive to <b>fracture</b> height. When the viscosity or injection rate of the <b>fracturing</b> fluid was too high, a single <b>fracture</b> was formed and the stimulated reservoir volume would be smaller. In the stimulated coalbed gas well, {{in order to reduce}} the formation damage caused by high-viscosity guanidine gum <b>fracturing</b> fluid, low-viscosity slickwater or clean <b>fracturing</b> fluid was used. However, for coal seams with well-developed natural <b>fractures,</b> low-viscosity <b>fracturing</b> fluid may easily cause leakage, thus forming multiple <b>fractures</b> hampering the main <b>fracture</b> propagation, also inducing tip screening out. Xiao et al. (2013, 2017) improved the anti-filtration and sand carrying capacity of the <b>fracturing</b> fluid by incorporating biodegradable fiber material in the active water <b>fracturing</b> fluid and <b>fracturing</b> stimulation of the coalbed methane well was enhanced as a result. Therefore, in the process of co-fracturing of a tight sandstone–coal interbedded reservoir, the method of mixed <b>fracturing</b> can be used. In the initial stage of <b>fracturing,</b> a high-viscosity <b>fracturing</b> fluid (such as cleaning <b>fracturing</b> fluid) is used to form a wide main <b>fracture,</b> reducing the complexity of the near-wellbore <b>fracture</b> and improving the effect of <b>fracture</b> penetration; then a biodegradable fiber active water <b>fracturing</b> fluid is used in the coal seam to effectively improve the communication of hydraulic <b>fractures</b> and natural <b>fractures,</b> and at the same time to reduce the amount of filtration, and to improve <b>fracture</b> growth propagation, so as to optimize the <b>fracture</b> morphology. In addition, due to higher breakdown pressure in the sandstone layer, optimization of perforation parameters in advance is needed in order to reduce operation difficulty.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fractures</b> of the humerus are {{classified}} {{based on the}} location of the <b>fracture</b> and then by the type of <b>fracture.</b> There are three locations that humerus <b>fractures</b> occur: at the proximal location, which is the top of the humerus near the shoulder, in the middle, which is at the shaft of the humerus, and the distal location, which is the bottom of the humerus near the elbow. Proximal <b>fractures</b> {{are classified}} into one of four types of <b>fractures</b> based on the displacement of the greater tubercle, the lesser tubercle, the surgical neck, and the anatomical neck, which are the four parts of the proximal humerus, with <b>fracture</b> displacement being defined as at least one centimeter of separation or an angulation greater than 45 degrees. One-part <b>fractures</b> involve no displacement of any parts of the humerus, two-part <b>fractures</b> have one part displaced relative to the other three; three-part <b>fractures</b> have two displaced fragments, and four-part <b>fractures</b> have all fragments displaced from each other. <b>Fractures</b> of the humerus shaft are subdivided into transverse <b>fractures,</b> spiral <b>fractures,</b> [...] "butterfly" [...] <b>fractures,</b> which are a combination of transverse and spiral <b>fractures,</b> and pathological <b>fractures,</b> which are <b>fractures</b> caused by medical conditions. Distal <b>fractures</b> are split between supracondylar <b>fractures,</b> which are transverse <b>fractures</b> above the two condyles {{at the bottom of the}} humerus, and intercondylar <b>fractures,</b> which involve a T- or Y-shaped <b>fracture</b> that splits the condyles.|$|R

40|$|Summary: In this {{meta-analysis}} {{of the control}} arms of four phase 3 trials, mild vertebral <b>fractures</b> were a significant risk factor for future vertebral <b>fractures</b> but not for non-vertebral <b>fracture.</b> Introduction: A prior vertebral <b>fracture</b> is {{a risk factor for}} future <b>fracture</b> that is commonly used as an eligibility criterion for treatment and in the assessment of <b>fracture</b> probability. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prognostic significance of a morphometric <b>fracture</b> according to the severity of <b>fracture.</b> Methods: We examined the control (placebo) treated arms of four phase 3 trials. Vertebral <b>fracture</b> status was graded at baseline in 7, 623 women, and <b>fracture</b> outcomes were documented over the subsequent 20, 000 patient-years. <b>Fracture</b> outcomes were characterised as a further vertebral <b>fracture,</b> a non-vertebral <b>fracture</b> or a clinical <b>fracture</b> (non-vertebral plus clinical vertebral <b>fracture).</b> The relative risk of <b>fracture</b> was computed from the merged β coefficients of each trial weighted according to the variance. Results: Mild vertebral <b>fractures</b> were a significant risk factor for vertebral <b>fractures</b> [risk ratio (RR) [*]=[*] 2. 17; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 70 – 2. 76] but were not associated with an increased risk of non-vertebral <b>fractures</b> (RR[*]=[*] 1. 08; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 86 – 1. 36). Moderate/severe vertebral <b>fractures</b> were associated with a high risk of vertebral <b>fractures</b> (RR[*]=[*] 4. 23; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 3. 58 – 5. 00) and a moderate though significant increase in non-vertebral <b>fracture</b> risk (RR[*]=[*] 1. 64; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 38 – 1. 94). Conclusions: Prior moderate/severe morphometric vertebral <b>fractures</b> are a strong and significant risk factor for future <b>fracture.</b> The presence of a mild vertebral <b>fracture</b> is of no significant prognostic value for non-vertebral <b>fractures.</b> These findings should temper the use of morphometric <b>fractures</b> in the assessment of risk and the design of phase 3 studies...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the association of <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location of displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> with specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability using <b>fracture</b> mapping techniques. <b>Fracture</b> line distribution and location of 66 acute displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> were identified using quantitative 3 -dimensional computed tomography reconstructions that allowed reduction of <b>fracture</b> fragments and a standardized method to divide the radial head into quadrants with forearm in neutral position. Based on qualitative and quantitative assessment of <b>fracture</b> maps, the association between <b>fracture</b> characteristics of displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> and specific elbow <b>fracture</b> patterns was determined. In partial articular radial head <b>fractures,</b> the highest <b>fracture</b> line intensity was located in the anterolateral quadrant near the center of the radial head. <b>Fracture</b> location corresponded with <b>fracture</b> line distribution; most <b>fractures</b> involved the anterolateral quadrant (n[*]=[*] 65; 98 %), whereas parts of the posteromedial quadrant were involved in a minority of the <b>fractures</b> (n[*]=[*] 10; 15 %). The association of <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location with overall <b>fracture</b> patterns of the elbow, as depicted on <b>fracture</b> maps, was not statistically significant. <b>Fracture</b> maps demonstrated no association between <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location of displaced partial articular <b>fractures</b> of the radial head and overall specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability, suggesting a common <b>fracture</b> mechanism that involves the anterolateral part of the radial head in most patient...|$|R
