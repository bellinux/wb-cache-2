He had sailed Caldicot Castle from Demerara on 27 February and by 8 March was about 200 miles east of Guadeloupe when at 8 pm two privateers, a schooner and a ship, came up and opened fire. After about 15 minutes, the schooner had sustained damages and had sheered off. By 9:20 the ship also sheared off but remained in sight. Next morning at 6am the ship recommenced the engagement. After about 15 minutes Sherrat had to strike. Caldicot Castles had been cut to pieces and <b>he</b> <b>an</b> two other men had been wounded, one of the mortally. The privateer was Grand Decide, which was armed with twenty 9-pounder and two 12-pounder brass guns, and had a crew of 160 men.|$|E

[...] The {{major issue in}} the campaign was alcohol—the legislature had passed a law authorizing localities to license saloons, and had authorized two referenda to allow additional regulation. [...] Hoadly, though ill {{for part of the}} campaign with malaria, deftly maneuvered the politically inexperienced Foraker into stating that he would not vote for the referenda. [...] This offended [...] "dry" [...] Republicans, splitting the party. [...] Foraker campaigned throughout the state, reaching nearly every county and generally speaking at least twice a day. [...] Nevertheless, he was defeated by over 12,000 votes, losing most counties, including Hamilton; according to Walters, [...] "although defeated in this campaign, Foraker gained by it; he won political repute through the state; no longer was <b>he</b> <b>an</b> 'unknown.

500|$|Winter in Americas only single release, [...] "The Bottle", {{soon became}} an {{underground}} and cult hit following its issue.

[...] The success of [...] "The Bottle" [...] also helped lead to Jackson's and Scott-Heron's following recording contract with Arista Records, which had been established in late 1974, the label at which they would enjoy further success and a larger amount of commercial notice. Upon signing them, Arista executive Clive Davis said of Scott-Heron in an interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "Not only is <b>he</b> <b>an</b> excellent poet, musician and performer—three qualities I look for that are rarely combined—but he's a leader of social thought." [...] Along with approval from Arista executives, Winter in America was well received by the underground music scene, in which Scott-Heron earned the majority of his fan base, and added to Scott-Heron's reputation as a socially aware and conscious artist.|$|E

500|$|After Pollexfen recovers {{from the}} attack, he {{sets out to}} duel Grandison. However, Grandison refuses {{on the grounds that}} dueling is harmful to society. After {{explaining}} why obedience to God and society are important, Grandison wins Pollexfen over and obtains his apology to Byron for his actions. She accepts his apology, and he follows with a proposal to marriage. She declines because she, as she admits, is in love with Grandison. However, a new suitor, the Earl of D, appears, and it emerges that Grandison promised himself to an Italian woman, Signorina Clementina della Porretta. As Grandison explains, he was in Italy years before and rescued the Barone della Porretta and a relationship developed between himself and Clementina, the baron's only daughter. However, Grandison could not marry her, as she demanded that <b>he,</b> <b>an</b> Anglican Protestant, become a Catholic, and he was unwilling to do so. After he left, she grew ill out of despair, and the Porrettas were willing to accept his religion, if he would return and make Clementina happy once more. Grandison, feeling obligated to do what he can to restore Clementina's happiness, returns to Italy; however, Clementina determines she can never marry a [...] "heretic", and so Grandison returns to England and Harriet who accepts him. They are married; and everyone is accorded their just deserts.|$|E
