5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E
5|$|The city sits {{halfway between}} the largest cities in Australia, being 452 {{kilometres}} southwest of Sydney and 456 kilometres northeast of Melbourne with the Sydney–Melbourne railway line passing through. The Sturt Highway, part of Australia's National Highway network, passes through the city on its way from Adelaide to its junction with the main Sydney–Melbourne route, the Hume Highway, a further 45 kilometres east. This location astride {{some of the major}} transport routes in the nation has made Wagga Wagga an important <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> depot for a number of companies including Toll Holdings. Wagga Wagga itself is the major regional centre for the Riverina and for much of the South West Slopes regions, providing education, health and other services to a region extending as far as Griffith to the west, Cootamundra to the north and Tumut to the east.|$|E

25|$|Because 21st and 22nd Streets, which cut north-south {{through the}} area, were once the main traffic routes between Interstate 4 and the Port of Tampa Bay, {{there was a}} large volume of {{semi-trailer}} truck traffic funneling through the historic district for many years. This caused damage to narrow city roads, was a danger to pedestrians, and sometimes resulted in trucks colliding with historic buildings. In 2014, the elevated I-4/Selmon Expressway Connector was built to siphon <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> traffic away from the historic district.|$|E
25|$|After {{crossing}} the Wallkill River and NY416, I-84 climbs slightly {{to its first}} exit in almost 10 miles (16km), NY208, serving nearby Walden and Maybrook. <b>Heavy</b> <b>truck</b> traffic at this exit reflects a nearby truck stop, Yellow Freight's large presence in Maybrook and a Staples warehouse north of the interstate along 208. The highway continues, now almost due east, of this exit through more wooded area, forming the northern border of Stewart State Forest, for four miles (6.4km) to the recently built exit with NY747 intended to improve access to nearby Stewart International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Maybrook, 208 reaches Interstate84 (I-84). This exit, {{the only one}} for several miles in either {{direction}} on the Interstate Highway, contains several businesses. Here, for the only point on its entire length, 208 swells beyond two lanes {{with the addition of}} turn lanes for the interstate's onramps. There is a <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> presence at the Rt. 208 and I-84 interchange. Several companies have built warehouse facilities on Neelytown Road, including Home Depot, Cardinal Health and Do It Best Corporation. Also found in this area is Federal Express Freight, Yellow Freight and several other national trucking firms.|$|E

At the same time, the Izhmash car plant was established in the city of Izhevsk as part of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, with the initiative coming from the Minister of Defence and in order to increase the overall production of cars in the Soviet Union. It produced Moskvitchs and Moskvitch-based kombi hatchbacks. KaMAZ, Europe's largest <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> plant, {{was built in}} Naberezhnye Chelny, while GAZ, ZIL, UralAZ, KrAZ, MAZ, BelAZ, and plants continued to produce other types of trucks.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1975, a {{group of}} South Moluccans were caught conspiring to steal a <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> and ram the gates of Soestdijk Palace to kidnap the queen. Ten {{members of the group}} were apprehended by the police in a vehicle full of fire arms; ten people were arrested. The group's alleged aim was to force the Dutch {{government}} to recognize the Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS) as an independent state and try to make the Indonesian government do the same. Seventeen South-Moluccan youngsters were tried and convicted and sentenced to up to 6 years imprisonment. This was {{one of a series of}} actions for this cause during the 1970s, including the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1975 Indonesian consulate hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch train hostage crisis, the 1977 Dutch school hostage crisis, and the 1978 Dutch province hall hostage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Ford gave up an {{executive}} position in <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> program management to become {{chairman of the}} finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well. On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} emit emissions {{at different}} rates than passenger vehicles. They may behave differently on the road as well, yet they are often treated similarly to passenger vehicles in emissions modeling. Although not frequently considered in calculating emission rates, differences in the operating speeds of passenger vehicles and <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> may influence emissions. The main goal of this research project was to evaluate whether <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> typically travel at significantly different operating speeds than passenger vehicles and what impact differences in on-road speeds would have on emissions. Average speeds and spot speeds were collected for <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> and passenger vehicles for four arterial segments and spot speeds were collected for two freeway segments in Des Moines, Iowa. Average and spot speeds were collected for four arterial segments and three freeway segments in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. The results of this research show that <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> and passenger vehicles operate differently on the road. Average and spot speeds were compared for <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> and passenger vehicles by facility. Average and spot speeds for heavy-duty trucks were lower than for passenger vehicles for all locations. Differences could have consequences for project level and regional emissions modeling particularly since the ability to demonstrate conformity {{is based on the}} ability to correctly estimate and model vehicle activity...|$|R

25|$|Interstate 795 {{began in}} 2007 as a {{renumbering}} of the US 117 freeway. Since oversized trucks couldn't use US 117 the state {{decided to get}} the road approved for Interstate designation. On September 28, 2007 AASHTO decided to approve the I-795 designation. The state quickly began to renumber mile posts, update signs and move US 117 back to its original designation. In 2008 major flaws in {{the surface of the}} highway began to develop. The thin road surface had begun to deteriorate mainly because of <b>heavy</b> <b>truck</b> use. The pavement was found to have flaws along the entire route and the FHWA decided that the highway should be resurfaced adding an extra 2.5 to 3 inches to the surface. The project of resurfacing the road was completed in 2010 and was later awarded the Sheldon G. Hayes Award for the best highway construction project and the smoothest road of 2011.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{identifies}} {{and discusses}} the changing structure {{of international trade}} and specialization in the industries of cars and <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks.</b> The main contribution of the thesis is that it discusses the patterns {{from the perspective of the}} car industry with the similar but in some aspects different industry of <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> as a contrasting example. This method aims at giving more knowledge about the varying challenges that different industries face in a globalized economy. To authors’ knowledge such a direct comparison has not yet been done. Some results presented in the study is that while car producers compete on a global scale the producers of <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks</b> does it on a regional scale. For the OECD 23 car producing countries, this implies competition from producers in countries with low factor input costs. This is probably one of the reasons why OECD 23 car producers have raised the export value or their goods relatively more than the producers of <b>heavy</b> <b>trucks.</b> The thesis also reveals how the patterns of export and specialization have shifted dramatically in both industries...|$|R
