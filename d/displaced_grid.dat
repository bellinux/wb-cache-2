40|$|By {{converting}} biomass residue to biochar, {{we could}} generate power cleanly and sequester carbon resulting in overall {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHG) savings when compared to typical fossil fuel usage and waste disposal. We estimated the carbon dioxide (CO 2) abatements and emissions associated to the concurrent production of bioenergy and biochar through biomass gasification in an organic walnut farm and processing facility in California, USA. We accounted for (i) avoided-CO 2 emissions from <b>displaced</b> <b>grid</b> electricity by bioenergy; (ii) CO 2 emissions from farm machinery used for soil amendment of biochar; (iii) CO 2 sequestered in the soil through stable biochar-C; and (iv) direct CO 2 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soil. The objective of these assessments was to pinpoint where the largest C offsets can be expected in the bioenergy-biochar chain. We found that energy production from gasification resulted in 91. 8 % of total C offsets, followed by stable biochar-C (8. 2 % of total C sinks), offsetting a total of 107. 7 kg CO 2 -C eq Mg- 1 feedstock. At the field scale, we monitored gas fluxes from soils for 29 months (180 individual observations) following field management and precipitation events in addition to weekly measurements within three growing seasons and two tree dormancy periods. We compared four treatments: control, biochar, compost, and biochar combined with compost. Biochar alone or in combination with compost did not alter total N 2 O and CO 2 emissions from soils, indicating that under the conditions of this study, biochar-prompted C offsets may not be expected from the mitigation of direct soil GHG emissions. However, this study revealed a case where a large environmental benefit was given by the waste-to-bioenergy treatment, addressing farm level challenges such as waste management, renewable energy generation, and C sequestration...|$|E
40|$|Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} processing methods that is recently reaching a mature state after years of solving theoretical and technical issues such as the non-uniqueness of the solution and harnessing the huge computational power required by realistic scenarios. BSIT (Barcelona Subsurface Imaging Tools, www. bsc. es/bsit) includes a FWI algorithm that can tackle with very complex problems involving large datasets. We present here the application of this system to a 3 D dataset acquired to constrain the shallow subsurface. This is where the wavefield is the most complicated, because most of the wavefield conversions takes place in the shallow region and also because the media is much more laterally heterogeneous. With this in mind, at least isotropic elastic approximation would be suitable as kernel engine for FWI. The current study explores the possibilities to apply elastic isotropic FWI using only the vertical component of the recorded seismograms. The survey covers an area of 500 × 500 m 2, and consists in a receivers grid of 10 m × 20 m combined with a 250 kg accelerated weight-drop as source on a <b>displaced</b> <b>grid</b> of 20 m× 20 m. One of the main challenges in this case study is the costly 3 D modeling that includes topography and substantial free surface effects. FWI is applied to a data subset (shooting lines 4 to 12), and is performed for 3 frequencies ranging from 15 to 25 Hz. The starting models are obtained from travel-time tomography and the all computation is run on 75 nodes of Mare Nostrum supercomputer during 3 days. The resulting models provide a higher resolution of the subsurface structures, and show a good correlation with the available borehole measurements.

40|$|VK: T 20203; T 20202 In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the viability of}} a 9. 5 -kWe wooden pellet-fueled Stirling engine-based micro-cogeneration plant {{as a substitute for}} small-scale district heating. The district heating systems against which the micro-cogeneration plant is compared are based either on a pellet-fueled boiler or a ground-source heat pump. The micro-cogeneration and district heating plants are compared in terms of primary energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and feasibility of the investment. The comparison also considers an optimally operated individual 0. 7 -kWe pellet-fueled Stirling engine micro-cogeneration system with exhaust gas heat recovery. The study is conducted in two different climates and contributes to the knowledge base by addressing: (i) hourly changes in the Finnish electricity generation mix; and (ii) uncertainty related to what systems are used as reference and the treatment of <b>displaced</b> <b>grid</b> electricity. Our computational results suggest that when operated at constant power, the 9. 5 -kWe Stirling engine plant results in reduced annual primary energy use compared with any of the alternative systems. The results are not sensitive to climate or the energy efficiency or number of buildings. In comparison with the pellet-fueled district heating plant, the annual use of primary energy and CO 2 emissions are reduced by a minimum of 25 and 19 %, respectively. Owing to a significant displacement of grid electricity, the system's net primary energy consumption appears negative when the total built area served by the plant is less than 1200 [*]m 2. On the economic side, the maximum investment cost threshold of a CHP-based district heating system serving 10 houses or more can typically be positive when compared with oil and pellet systems, but negative when compared with a corresponding heat pump system.

40|$|PV only generates {{electricity}} {{during daylight}} hours and primarily generates over summer. In the UK, the carbon intensity of grid electricity is higher during the daytime and over winter. This work investigates whether the <b>grid</b> electricity <b>displaced</b> by PV is {{high or low}} carbon compared to the annual mean carbon intensity using carbon factors at higher temporal resolutions (half-hourly and daily). UK policy for carbon reporting requires savings to be calculated using the annual mean carbon intensity of grid electricity. This work offers an insight into whether this technique is appropriate. Using half hourly data on the generating plant supplying the grid from November 2008 to May 2010, carbon factors for grid electricity at half-hourly and daily resolution have been derived using technology specific generation emission factors. Applying these factors to generation data from PV systems installed on schools, {{it is possible to}} assess the variation in the carbon savings from <b>displacing</b> <b>grid</b> electricity with PV generation using carbon factors with different time resolutions. The data has been analyzed for a period of 363 to 370 days and so cannot account for inter-year variations in the relationship between PV generation and carbon intensity of the electricity grid. This analysis suggests that PV displaces more carbon intensive electricity using half-hourly carbon factors than using daily factors but less compared with annual ones. A similar methodology could provide useful insights on other variable renewable and demand-side technologies and in other countries where PV performance and grid behavior are different. ...|$|R

This study closes this gap by assessing {{the environmental impacts of}} ethanol production from sugarcane molasses in Uttar Pradesh, India. A comparative analysis with south-central Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is also presented to compare the performance of sugarcane molasses-based ethanol with sugarcane juice-based ethanol. Methods The production process is assessed by a cradle-togate life cycle assessment. The multifunctionality problem is solved by applying two variants of system expansion and economic allocation. Environmental impacts are assessed with Impact 2002 + and results are presented at the midpoint level for greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable energy use, freshwater eutrophication and water use. Furthermore, results include impacts on human health and ecosystem quality at the damage level. Sensitivity analysis is also performed on key contributing parameters such as pesticides, stillage treatment and irrigation water use. Results and discussion It is found that, compared to Brazilian ethanol, Indian ethanol causes lower or comparable greenhouse gas emissions (0. 09 – 0. 64 kgCO 2 eq/kgethanolIN, 0. 46 – 0. 63 kgCO 2 eq/kgethanolBR), non-renewable energy use (− 0. 3 – 6. 3 MJ/kgethanolIN, 1 – 4 MJ/kgethanolBR), human health impacts (3. 6 · 10 − 6 DALY/kgethanolIN, 4 · 10 − 6 DALY/kgethanolBR) and ecosystem impairment (2. 5 PDF·m 2 ·year/kgethanolIN, 3. 3 PDF·m 2 ·year/kgethanolBR). One reason is that Indian ethanol is exclusively produced from molasses, a co-product of sugar production, resulting in allocation of the environmental burden. Additionally, Indian sugar mills and distilleries produce surplus electricity for which they receive credits for <b>displacing</b> <b>grid</b> electricity of relatively high CO 2 emission intensity. When economic allocation is applied, the greenhouse gas emissions for Indian and Brazilian ethanol are comparable. Non-renewable energy use is higher for Indian ethanol, primarily due to energy requirements for irrigation. For water use and related impacts, Indian ethanol scores worse due groundwater irrigation, despite the dampening effect of allocation. The variation on greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use of Indian ills is much larger for high and low performance than the respective systems in Brazil. Conclusions Important measures can be taken across the production chain to improve the environmental performance of Indian ethanol production (e. g. avoiding the use of specific pesticides, avoiding the disposal of untreated stillage, transition to water efficient crops).

40|$|The Brazil/U. S. Aspen Global Forum on Climate Change Policies and Programs has {{facilitated}} {{a dialogue}} between key Brazil and U. S. public and private sector leaders {{on the subject of}} the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). With support from the U. S. government, a cooperative effort between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Sao Paulo conducted an assessment of a number of projects put forth by Brazilian sponsors. Initially, we gathered information and conducted a screening assessment for ten projects in the energy sector and six projects in the forestry sector. Some of the projects appeared to offer greater potential to be attractive for CDM, or had better information available. We then conducted a more detailed assessment of 12 of these projects, and two other projects that were submitted after the initial screening. An important goal was to assess the potential impact of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) on the financial performance of projects. With the exception of the two forestry-based fuel displacement projects, the impact of CERs on the internal rate of return (IRR) is fairly small. This is true for both the projects that <b>displace</b> <b>grid</b> electricity and those that displace local (diesel-based) electricity production. The relative effect of CERs is greater for projects whose IRR without CERs is low. CERs have a substantial effect on the IRR of the two short-rotation forestry energy substitution projects. One reason is that the biofuel displaces coke and oil, both of which are carbon-intensive. Another factor is that the product of these projects (charcoal and woodfuel, respectively) is relatively low value, so the revenue from carbon credits has a strong relative impact. CERs also have a substantial effect on the NPV of the carbon sequestration projects. Financial and other barriers pose a challenge for implementation of most of the projects. In most cases, the sponsor lacks sufficient capital, and loans are available only at high interest rate and with substantial guarantee. A few of the projects might go ahead without the benefit of CERs, but most probably would not. Whether the projected revenue from CERs would be sufficient to induce sponsors to proceed with the projects is an important issue that requires further investigation. All of the projects contribute to economic development in Brazil. The forestry projects in particular would create a significant number of rural jobs, and contribute income to rural communities. Some of the carbon sequestration projects would provide environmental benefits with respect to protection of biodiversity and soil...|$|R
30|$|Gabor wavelet {{transform}} can produce effective features as these wavelets {{are known to}} generate biologically-motivated convolution kernels [9]. To this effect, a bank of filters is created by using Gabor kernels in different orientations and frequencies (scales), and then convolved with the data to form a Gabor space. In this vein, Smeraldi and Bigun [59] developed a bio-inspired scheme where Gabor features were computed on a retinatopic sampling grid on the face. For uniform frequency coverage, they used modified Gabor filters, where shifts of Gaussians on the log-polar frequency plane correspond to rotations and scaling. The facial components are found by <b>displacing</b> the retinatopic <b>grid</b> and evaluating the output with SVM classifiers.

40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} on faults and hydrocarbon seal {{put pressure on}} geologists and reservoir engineers doing reservoir modeling. All geo-knowledge must be built into the reservoir models to assure that it is {{taken into account in}} the decision processes. The need for advanced modeling tools is increasing. This paper describes the development of a fault modeling tool, the methodology behind it and examples of fault modeling studies. The general focus is on the uncertainty related to faults. The tool can be used for sensitivity analysis of fault effects, including studies of the flow effects of all faults scales, adding faults to simulation grids, and studies of the geometric uncertainty of the faults. The work started out as a development of a tool for stochastic modeling of sub-seismic scale faults. The faults can be added to a flow simulation grid as both displacement and seal. The current tool has been designed to operate together with the Eclipse flow simulator and the IRAP RMS program package. IRAP RMS is the main tool for visualizing output and Eclipse is used to examine the effect of the faults on hydrocarbon recovery. The techniques for modeling of fault seal, outputting results in a format that Eclipse can directly utilize, and the possibility for <b>displacing</b> simulation <b>grids</b> has proved useful also to seismic scale faults. This has led to further development, more detailed fault models and improvements of the general fault modeling capabilities.

40|$|This {{research}} {{assesses the}} comparative environmental {{profiles of the}} bioenergy systems - biofuel (ethanol) and biomass electricity - derived from switchgrass. Switchgrass cultivation as a dedicated energy crop is an emerging practice. It has high yield with relatively low nutrient requirements and has a great potential to meet future energy needs. The contribution {{of this research is}} twofold. First, the life cycle energy and GHG emissions of individual bioenergy pathways - producing cellulosic ethanol and biomass electricity - are analyzed in greater detail. In contrast with previous studies, we have not just used a single value of input parameters for different life cycle stages, but instead, have assessed the impact based on a probability distribution by incorporating a Monte Carlo analysis. This has helped to address the variability in the lifecycle impacts of bioenergy systems and establishing a range of energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts, rather than previous single-valued estimates. Second, a framework to compare cellulosic ethanol and biomass electricity lifecycle energy and GHG emissions is provided. We propose the criterion for comparison should not be dictated by absolute emissions along a certain bioenergy pathway, such as producing biofuels or biomass electricity. Instead, we consider the savings in emissions from the displacement of fossil fuel by biomass along each pathway. Based on this criterion, we quantify the lifecycle GHG emissions impacts of each pathway, compare them to the reference fossil energy system and compare their land use efficiency. The average lifecycle GHG emissions of ethanol are assessed as 35 g CO 2 -eq/MJ of energy, with a minimum-maximum range of GHG emissions varying from 25 to 50 g CO 2 -eq/MJ. Switchgrass yield, fertilizer application rates and conversion efficiency are important determinants in the overall variation in the GHG balance. For example, the GHG contribution from the agricultural stage of switchgrass varies over a large range from 500 to 1200 kg CO 2 -eq/ha/year. A comparison between cellulosic ethanol and a gasoline system shows that on average 55 g CO 2 -eq/MJ of energy are saved if gasoline use is replaced by cellulosic ethanol derived from switchgrass. The average life cycle GHG emissions from biomass electricity are 100 g CO 2 -eq/kWh, with a minimum-maximum range of GHG emissions varying from 90 to 110 g CO 2 eq/kWh. In comparison to the U. S. grid electricity, 513 g CO 2 -eq/kWh of energy are saved if biomass electricity from switchgrass <b>displaces</b> the <b>grid</b> electricity. Avoided emissions per unit of energy, however, are also dependent on regional factors, such as regional electricity grid mix. When comparing these bioenergy systems in terms of land use efficiency, biomass electricity has a better environmental profile in terms of energy sue and GHG emissions than ethanol. 4. 5 ton CO 2 -eq/ha/year emissions are saved if we use all the switchgrass cultivated on a hectare of land to produce ethanol. For biomass electricity, the annual GHG emissions saved are 10 ton CO 2 -eq/ha/year. The GHG emissions offset from the best case of cellulosic ethanol is comparable to emissions offset from the worst case of biomass electricity. We have also analyzed another case of the comparative environmental profile of these two bioenergy systems, formulated assuming a special case of biomass electricity use. In this case, all the biomass electricity produced is used to charge electric vehicles and ethanol is used to power Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFVs). 145 g CO 2 -eq/km will be saved if we use ethanol is used instead of gasoline in FFVs. In the case of electric vehicles, 110 g CO 2 -eq/km is saved if we use biomass electricity instead of the U. S. average grid power. Thus, biomass electricity is not a very effective alternative if the end goal of bioenergy policies is to use biomass only in the transportation sector. These findings are different from the previous bioenergy comparison studies, which have only estimated the offset of a biomass powered electric vehicle by comparing it to a gasoline-powered car. These studies concluded that biomass electricity has a better environmental profile than cellulosic ethanol...|$|R
