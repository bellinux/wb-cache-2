5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} use of random {{projections}} for local density preservation. We show that under certain conditions, points with high Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have their value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space lower bounded <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> original LOF. This allows us to search for top-n local outliers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space with high recall. We can also employ tree-based data structures (such as kD-Trees) to efficiently search <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space. Thus, perhaps for the first time, we have a sub-quadratic algorithm to identify top-n local outliers in high dimensional spaces. An extensive set of experiments confirm that we can directly discover local outlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space with high accuracy. An en-hancement step of using <b>the</b> neighbors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space as a filtering step for LOF computation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original space further enhances the accuracy of local outlier detection. 1...|$|R

40|$|We use {{state-of-the-art}} {{global climate}} models and observations {{to show that}} <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> higher pressures over the British Isles due to global warming {{are part of an}} atmospheric response to the decelerating Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) causing a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> associated northward heat transport, keeping the North Atlantic relatively cool. However, considerable inter-model differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> weakening of <b>the</b> AMOC lead to a large spread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> wind changes. Hence, <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> reduction of oceanic heat transport is a main source of uncertainty in projections of Western European climate change. Better-constrained projections of European summer climate thus rely heavily on a more realistic representation of ocean processes in climate models...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the Slovene artist Marjetica Potrc works with {{sustainability}} and empowerment in her “On-Site” projects. An analysis of various indicators of sustainability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> clarifies what <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> have <b>in</b> common. Balance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationships between people and nature stand out as a major theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects.</b> <b>The</b> artist works with tools such as “participatory design” where all participants are of equal importance, and “relational objects” with which the participants negotiate and transform the common space. The theory of “relational aesthetics” by Nicolas Bourriaud is applicable to the relational qualities of <b>the</b> <b>projects,</b> and <b>the</b> concept that all parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works functions as “forms” could be used here. Nature can be read as “form” together with the rest of the participants, on a “stage” of action <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects.</b> <b>In</b> all <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> one or more solutions are presented. By creating ideal prototypes of reality, where everyone, including nature, is empowered to participate on equal grounds, a solution is presented for a sustainable lifestyle...|$|R
