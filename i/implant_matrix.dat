This kind of porous titanium with good bio-mechanical compatibility {{may have the}} potential toalleviate the problems caused by the mismatch of the strength and Youngs modulus between implant (110 GPa for titanium) and bone. Moreover, the pores (mainly in 100 - 700 µm) are all interconnected. This porous structure would endow thematerials with better activity between bone and porous <b>implant</b> <b>matrix.</b> Furthermore, biocompatible porous titanium with aporosity of 33. 51 - 49. 09 vol. %, a compressive strength of 156. 19 - 173. 34 MPa and a hardness of 438. 51 - 461. 40 is known tobe a good candidate material for use as bone implants.

40|$|An {{injectable}} polyethylene glycol-crosslinked albumin gel (AG) {{supplemented with}} hyaluronic acid as a matrix for autologous chondrocyte implantation was evaluated {{with regard to}} its impact on angiogenesis. Healthy articular cartilage and intervertebral discs (IVD) are devoid of blood vessels, whereas pathological blood vessel formation augments degeneration of both theses tissues. In contrast to human endothelial cells, primary human articular chondrocytes encapsulated in the AG retained their viability. Endothelial cells did not adhere to the gel surface to a significant extent nor did they proliferate in vitro. The AG did not release any diffusible toxic components. Contrary to MatrigelTM employed as positive control, the AG prevented endothelial chemoinvasion in Transwell filter assays even {{in the presence of}} a chemotactic gradient of vascular endothelial growth factor. In ovo, the AG exhibited a barrier function for blood vessels of the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Subcutaneous implantation of human IVD chondrocytes enclosed in the albumin gel into immunodeficient mice revealed a complete lack of angiogenesis inside the gel after two weeks. At the same time, the IVD chondrocytes within the gel remained vital and displayed a characteristic gene expression pattern as judged from aggrecan, collagen type I and type II mRNA levels. In summary, aiming at articular cartilage and IVD regeneration the albumin gel promises to be a beneficial <b>implant</b> <b>matrix</b> for chondrocytes simultaneously exhibiting non-permissive properties for adverse endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Osteoinduction is the {{formation}} of ectopic bone that follows implantation of demineralized allogeneic bone matrix (DABM) and {{is believed to be}} secondary to the release of associated inductive factors from bone matrix. To clarify the role of vitamin D in osteoinduction, we implanted DABM from vitamin D-deficient rats (-D rats) into normal rats (+D rats). Because mitogens and osteocalcin might be involved in osteoinduction, these were measured. Mitogenic activity in extracts from mineralized allogeneic bone matrix (ABM) and DABM from both +D and -D rats was determined with an assay that utilizes monolayer cultures of embryonic chick calvarial cells. Osteocalcin in serum and DABM was measured by radioimmunoassay. DABM from -D rats did not promote osteoinduction as effectively as DABM from +D rats. Resorption of <b>implant</b> <b>matrix</b> from -D rats was diminished compared with resorption of matrix from +D rats (P less than 0. 01), and the decrease was attributed to a corresponding {{decrease in the number of}} osteoclasts in the implants (P less than 0. 02). Bone formation (P less than 0. 01) and total implant mineralization (P less than 0. 001) were significantly reduced in implants from -D rats, and the reductions corresponded with a decline in the number of osteoblasts (P less than 0. 05). Mitogenic activity in DABM from +D rats was only slightly decreased as compared with activity in ABM, but DABM from -D rats contained significantly less activity (P less than 0. 001). No mitogenic activity was identified in implants of DABM from either +D or -D rats 3 wk after implantation. Serum osteocalcin was significantly higher in -D as compared with +D animals. In contrast, the concentrations of osteocalcin in DABM from the two groups of animals were not significantly different from each other. These findings indicate that the diminished osteoinductive activity of DABM from -D rats results from deficiency of one or more mitogenic factors that are essential for inducing the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells at the implant site and that osteocalcin does not play a role in this regard...|$|E

METHODS: A tract of about 2 cm of tubular gastric acellular matrix was inserted with bilateral anastomosis in an isolated ileal loop, which was located in endoabdominal position through a short subcutaneous tunnel. Twelve animals were analyzed at each of the time-points ranging from 1 to 6 weeks after surgery.

40|$|Background:Abdominal wall defects {{secondary}} to hernias, trauma or disease {{are a common}} problem in surgery. Complications of closing these defects with synthetic meshes include foreign body reactions, infection, and adhesions to abdominal viscera. To minimize these problems, several acellular dermis derived collagen products are being used clinically for tissue replacement/reconstruction and repair of abdominal wall defects, including both animal (bovine, porcine) and human derived products, chemically crosslinked or non-crosslinked. While these implants are in use clinically, the inflammatory response each causes, cellular and vascular permeation into the implant, and relative amount of implant remodeling have not been completely characterized. Purpose:The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare Alloderm (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg NJ), Permacol (Tissue Science Laboratories, Andover, Ma) and CollaMend (C. R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ) in a rat model, using histologic staining to evaluate the patterns of inflammatory response, cellular and vascular permeation into implant, and relative amount of implant remodeling. Methods:Abdominal wall defects were created in 127 Spraque Dawly rats by removing a one centimeter by three centimeter portion of rectus muscles lateral to the midline. Rats were randomized into four groups, and the defect was repaired with an inlay graft of one centimeter by three centimeter sections of Alloderm, Permacol and CollaMend; the fourth group served as the control and the defect was closed primarily. 4. 0 Prolene was used to close the abdominal wall defect in all rats; the skin was closed in a running subcuticular fashion with 4. 0 PDS. Rats were sacrificed at time intervals of three days, one week, two weeks, one month, three months and six months. The defect area was explanted, including the implants with a surrounding muscle strip, placed into formalin, and two representative samples from each group at each time point were sectioned. Sections were stained with Hemotoxylin and Eosin (H 2 ̆ 6 E), Mason’s Trichrome (stains cell nuclei and cytoplasm red, collagen blue), and Verhoeff stain (stains mature elastin black.) Results:Three distinct inflammation patterns were noted in the Permacol, CollaMend and Alloderm groups, compared to the control group and to one another. Cellular infiltration peaked much earlier in the Alloderm implants with blood vessel formation in the implant identifiable by 14 days and evidence of thick channels of cellular infiltrate pushing apart the <b>implant</b> <b>matrix.</b> Both the Permacol and CollaMend implants developed distinct patterns of inflammation on their ventral and dorsal portions, but these thick cellular coats did not appear to “send” cells into the implant. By one month in the CollaMend implants, the ventral coat of cells was totally disconnected from the implant itself, and the implant as a whole was only sparsely infiltrated by cells. The Permacol group at one month had only a few cells at the middle of implant, though several strong channels of cellular penetration at the lateral edges of the implant were apparent, as well as a few blood vessels. In all three experimental groups, copious inflammation was seen at the junction between the native rectus fascia and implant. Infiltration of the implant originating from this large collection of cells was seen, in varying degrees, in all three implant groups. Side by side histologic photographs of the implant groups at various time points will be included in the presentation. Conclusions:Alloderm, Permacol and CollaMend implants have all been described for use in abdominal wall reconstruction, but the materials have very different inflammatory patterns as well as rates and types of cellular and vascular permeation in a rat model...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{regenerative}} medicine we aim to develop <b>implant</b> <b>matrices</b> for specific tissue needs. By combining two per se, cell-permissive gel systems with enzymatic crosslinkers (gelatin/transglutaminase and fibrinogen/thrombin) to generate a blend (technical term: quattroGel), an unexpected cell-selectivity evolved. QuattroGels were porous and formed cavities in the cell diameter range, possessed gelation kinetics in the minute range, viscoelastic properties and a mechanical strength appropriate for general cell adhesion, and restricted diffusion. Cell proliferation of endothelial cells, chondrocytes and fibroblasts was essentially unaffected. In contrast, on quattroGels neither endothelial cells formed vascular tubes nor did primary neurons extend neurites in significant amounts. Only chondrocytes differentiated properly as judged by collagen isoform expression. The biophysical quattroGel characteristics appeared to leave distinct cell processes such as mitosis unaffected and favored differentiation of sessile cells, but hampered differentiation of migratory cells.

The calcification of the hypertrophied chondrocytes and new bone formation were correlated with increased alkaline phosphatase activity and 4 sCa incorporation. The ingrowth of capillaries on day 9 resulted in chondrolysis and osteogenesis. Further remodelling of bony trabeculae by osteoclasts resulted in an ossicle of cancellous bone.

We sought to develop the natural hydrogel matrix fibrin as platform for extensive interactions and continuous signaling by the vascular morphogen ephrin-B 2 that normally resides in the plasma membrane and requires multivalent presentation for ligation and activation of Eph receptors on apposing endothelial cell surfaces. Using fibrin and protein engineering technology to induce multivalent ligand presentation, a recombinant mutant ephrin-B 2 receptor binding domain was covalently coupled to fibrin networks at variably high densities. The ability of fibrin-bound ephrin-B 2 to act as ligand for endothelial cells was preserved, as demonstrated by a concomitant, dose-dependent increase of endothelial cell binding to engineered ephrin-B 2 -fibrin substrates in vitro. The therapeutic relevance of ephrin-B 2 -fibrin <b>implant</b> <b>matrices</b> was demonstrated by a local angiogenic response in the chick embryo chorioallontoic membrane evoked by the local and prolonged presentation of matrix-bound ephrin-B 2 to tissue adjacing the implant.

Endothelial cells (ECs) in collagen scaffolds adopt a reparative phenotype with significant therapeutic potential. Although {{the biology of}} MEECs is increasingly understood, tuning of scaffold properties to control cell-substrate interactions is less well-studied. It is hypothesized that modulating scaffold degradation would change EC phenotype. Scaffolds with differential degradation are prepared by cross-linking and predegradation. Vascular injury increases degradation {{and the presence of}} MEECs retards injury-mediated degradation. MEECs respond to differential scaffold properties with altered viability in vivo, suppressed smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro, and altered interleukin- 6 and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 expression. When implanted perivascularly to a murine carotid wire injury, tuned scaffolds change MEEC effects on vascular repair and inflammation. Live animal imaging enables real-time tracking of cell viability, inflammation, and scaffold degradation, affording an unprecedented understanding of interactions between cells, substrate, and tissue. MEEC-treated injuries improve endothelialization and reduce SMC hyperplasia over 14 d.

We report an engineered aprotinin variant that can be immobilized within fibrin and thus provide extended longevity. When recombinantly fused to a transglutaminase substrate domain from α(2) -plasmin inhibitor (α(2) PI(1 - 8)), the resulting variant, aprotinin-α(2) PI(1 - 8), was covalently crosslinked into fibrin matrices during normal thrombin/factor XIIIa-mediated polymerization. Challenge with physiological plasmin concentrations revealed that aprotinin-α(2) PI(1 - 8) -containing matrices retained 78 % of their mass after 3 wk, whereas matrices containing wild type (WT) aprotinin degraded completely within 1 wk. Plasmin challenge of commercial sealants Omrixil and Tisseel, supplemented with aprotinin-α(2) PI(1 - 8) or WT aprotinin, showed extended longevity as well.

The rat tubular cortical bone matrices were demineralized in heated 0. 6 N HCl at 60 °C for 5 and 20 mins, respectively, using a controlled-heat ultrasonic cleaner and implanted in rat dorsal subcutaneous pouches and thigh muscles for 1 - 3 weeks. The {{influence of the}} demineralized condition of bone matrix on cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was also evaluated in vitro by MTT assay and ALP staining. The cortical matrices were completely demineralized within 20 mins by sonication and heating of diluted 0. 6 N HCl. The sonicated bone matrices in heated acidic solution at 60 °C revealed no adverse immunogenic and inflammatory response in vivo regardless of demineralized condition. Cellular proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation was facilitated by more fully demineralized. Ectopic bone formation was induced only by demineralized bone matrices and were more favorable in fully demineralized matrices. The ectopic bone induction was more favorably in subcutaneous pouches than in muscular tissue. These findings suggest that a fully demineralized cortical bone matrix maximizes osteogenic repair by exposing more bioactive molecules which in turn induce chondro- and osteognic differentiation of mesenchymal cells around the <b>implanted</b> <b>matrices,</b> and that the sonication of diluted 0. 6 N HCl heated at 60 ° C is a rapid and effective method for sterile demineralized graft preparation...|$|R

40|$|A {{developing}} {{therapy for}} complete or partial {{loss of function}} in various tissues and organs involves transplanting an appropriate cell population, capable of compensating for the existing deficiencies. Clinical application {{of this type of}} strategy is currently limited by the death or dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells after delivery to the recipient. A delay in thorough vascularization of the implant area creates an environment low in oxygen and other nutrients, and likely contributes to the initial death of transplanted cells. We have addressed this problem by sustained delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an initiator of angiogenesis, from a porous polymer matrix utilized simultaneously for cell delivery. As expected from previous studies, VEGF delivered from these constructs elicited an enhanced angiogenic response over a 2 -week period when implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice.

We explored {{the possibility of using}} an ACM to repair a muscular AWD in an animal model. Male New Zealand white rabbits (3 - 4 kg, n = 18) were anesthetized and the abdominal wall was shaved and scrubbed; a vertical incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a large patch of external-oblique muscle was resected (3 x 3 cm). The animals underwent reconstruction with homologous diaphragm acellular matrix (HDAM) grafts that were previously prepared using a detergent enzymatic method. The patches were evaluated histologically at 9 (n = 6), 40 (n = 6), and 90 (n = 6) days post-surgery in each group; moreover, 90 days post-surgery an electromyogram (EMG) (n = 6) of the <b>implanted</b> <b>matrix</b> was recorded. Histologic analysis demonstrated that the HDAM supported fibroblast migration, deposition of newly-formed collagen, and neovascularization. No signs of necrosis, or evidence of skeletal-muscle-cell ingrowth were detected. The EMG revealed minimum muscular electrophysiologic activity, probably due to muscle underlying the patch. The HDAM we employed was thus not able to produce reconstruction of the skeletal muscle, and was progressively remodeled into fibrous tissue.

Follow-up examinations were carried out at 6 weeks, 6 months, and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after implantation. Clinical assessment included the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Tegner activity scale, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Radiological assessment for graft attachment and tissue regeneration was performed using the magnetic observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (males: n = 6 and females: n = 9) with a mean age of 26. 4 years (range 19 - 40) were treated. The mean VAS improved significantly when compared to the preoperative values (P < 0. 05). Six weeks after implantation, IKDC values were slightly lower than the preoperative values (n. s.), but increased significantly at final follow-up (P < 0. 05). At 24 months, there were no significant differences in the median Tegner score between the post-operative values and the preoperative values (n. s.). However, after 36 months, a significant improvement was noted that lasted at least up to 48 months (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} results {{in terms of the}} {{efficacy}} and safety of collagen <b>matrix</b> <b>implant</b> [Ologen (OLO) implant] versus mitomycin C (MMC) in trabeculectomy for the surgical treatment of primary congenital glaucoma. Materials and methods Twenty eyes of 15 patients with primary congenital glaucoma were divided into two groups. The first group (MMC group) included 10 eyes that were subjected to trabeculectomy with MMC. The second group (OLO group) included 10 eyes that were subjected to trabeculectomy with a collagen <b>matrix</b> <b>implant</b> (OLO implant). All procedures were performed in Sohag University Hospital. Postoperative evaluation included intraocular pressure (IOP) level, bleb evaluation, complications, and the need for further medication or surgical intervention. The postoperative IOP level was classified into four groups (> 21, > 17 - 21, 15 - 17, and < 15 mmHg). Results At the end of the sixth postoperative follow-up month, in the MMC group, only 10 % of eyes achieved the target IOP, 10 % of eyes had failed surgery, and 80 % of eyes had IOP ranging from 15 to 21 mmHg. However, in the OLO group, 40 % of eyes achieved the target IOP, 60 % of eyes had IOP ranging from 15 to 21 mmHg, and there were no failed surgeries. In terms of complications, the MMC group had a higher rate of complications than the OLO group in the form of early hyphema, bleb leakage, hypotony, and choroidal detachment. Conclusion This study proved that the use of a collagen <b>matrix</b> <b>implant</b> yields more effective results than MMC when combined with trabeculectomy for the treatment of primary congenital glaucoma. Furthermore, OLO implantation is safe and has low incidences of complications. Because of the small sample size in this study, which limits the statistical comparison between the groups, further larger studies are required to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of this new device...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{the spinal}} cord induce {{distinct}} changes at the lesion site. Over recent years, {{it has been shown}} that the hostile environment of the reactive, lesioned central nervous system inhibits axonal regrowth. This is in stark contrast to the lesioned peripheral nervous system which has a strong capacity for axon regeneration and functional recovery. In the present thesis, a tissue engineering strategy to promote orientated axonal regrowth and functional tissue repair has been investigated in an experimental animal model of acute spinal cord injury. After undergoing a mid-cervical (C 4) dorsal laminectomy, adult female Lewis rats were subjected to a unilateral funiculotomy (involving a tissue resection of 1 - 2 mm). A novel, orientated, type I collagen matrix (either seeded or non-seeded with syngeneic olfactory ensheathing cells, OEC) was implanted into the lesion gap and the function of the ipsilateral fore-paw was monitored. At the end-point survival time of 5 months, animals were perfused and the lesion site dissected and processed for immunohistochemistry to demonstrate host astrocystic, axonal and dendritic responses using antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), growth associated protein- 43 (Gap- 43 /B 50), 200 kDa phosphorylated neurofilament (NF 200) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP- 2). The type I collagen matrix was found to be biocompatible and acted as a guidance system, supporting the longitudinally orientated regeneration of host axon Integration of the OEC-seeded matrix was most successful, with both host astrocytic and axonal profiles crossing the graft-host interface and penetrating the implant to varying degrees. Surprisingly, host dendrites were also found to penetrate the <b>implanted</b> <b>matrices,</b> a so-far undescribed phenomenon. Furthermore, the interface between the matrix and dura mater was found to be a region of substantial tissue regrowth and orientated axon regeneration. Although implanted scaffolds supported improved motor performance of the ipsilateral fore-paw, there was no clear correlation between the extent of axon regeneration and the degree of functional recovery. It is likely, therefore, that implanted devices may exert hitherto unexpected beneficial effects on the lesioned central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Ceramides (CER) are {{involved}} in alcohol-induced neuroinflammation. In a mouse model of chronic alcohol exposure, 16 CER and 18 sphingomyelin (SM) concentrations from whole brain lipid extracts were measured using electrospray mass spectrometry. All 18 CER concen-trations in alcohol exposed adults increased significantly (range: 25 − 607 %); in juveniles, 6 CER decreased (range: − 9 to − 37 %). In contrast, only three SM decreased in adult and one increased significantly in juvenile. Next, regional identification at 50 μm spatial resolution from coronal sections was obtained with <b>matrix</b> <b>implanted</b> laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MILDI-MSI) by <b>implanting</b> silver nanoparticulate <b>matrices</b> followed by focused laser desorption. Most of the CER and SM quantified in whole brain extracts were detected in MILDI images. Coronal sections from three brain levels show qualitative regional changes in CER-SM ion intensities, {{as a function of}} group and brain region, in cortex, striatum, accumbens, habenula, and hippocampus. Highly correlated changes in certain white matter CER-SM pairs occur in regions across all groups, including the hippocampus and the lateral (but not medial) cerebellar cortex of adult mice. Our data provide the first microscale MS evidence of regional lipid intensity variations induced by alcohol...|$|R
40|$|A {{dramatic}} increase in the incidence of eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, and inadequate therapeutic control has led to the search for advanced methods of sustained and targeted drug delivery. The development of polymeric devices, <b>matrix</b> <b>implants</b> and microspheres has facilitated the prolonged controlled release of therapies to the target sites. The aim {{of this study is to}} prepare brimonidine tartrate-loaded microspheres, which possess suitable characteristics for development into an implantable device that will later exploit the binding properties of ocular melanin to influence the release properties...|$|R
40|$|NIMThe {{implantation}} of low-velocity massive gold clusters {{is shown}} to be a method of choice for homogeneous incorporation of a metallic matrix into the near-surface region of a solid biopolymer for subsequent laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS analysis. <b>Matrix</b> <b>implanted</b> (MI) LDI spectra from cluster-implanted pure test peptide or tissue exhibit molecular ion peaks similar to those observed by matrix-assisted LDI. Moreover, the ion emission is very reproducible from any spot on the surface of these test samples.

40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} {{efficacy}} of Ologen® Collagen <b>Matrix</b> <b>Implant</b> in refractory glaucoma surgery. Materials and methods. Classical non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) with Ologen® implantation in the scleral bed was performed. Results. Post-op, implant was visualized underneath the conjunctiva and moved within the scleral flap. Implant was resolved in 3 months with moderate filtering bleb formation. Following 12 months, visual acuity and visual fields were stable, IOP level was 12 ‑ 17 mm Hg. Conclusion. Within 12 ‑months follow-up, Ologen® implantation in the course of glaucoma surgery prevents scleral conjunctival scarring, provides long-term IOP-lowering effect and preserves residual visual functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-linear {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to characterize bovine smooth muscle cells and their proliferation, migration, and differentiation in hydrogel cellulose scaffolds, toward the development of fully functional blood vessel <b>implants.</b> The extracellular <b>matrix</b> (ECM) composed of cellulose and endogenous collagen fibers was imaged using Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy and the cell morphology by Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy. Images prove that cells adhere on the cellulose scaffold without additional surface modification and that both contractile and proliferating phenotypes are developed. This work shows that non-linear microscopy contributes with unique insights in cell interactions with (artificial) ECM components and has the potential to become an established characterization method in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this research}} was that implants of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres loaded with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) and distributed in a freeze-dried carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) matrix would produce more new bone than would <b>matrix</b> <b>implants</b> of non-protein-loaded microspheres or <b>matrix</b> <b>implants</b> of only CMC. To test this hypothesis it was necessary to fashion microsphere-loaded CMC implants that were simple to insert, fit precisely into a defect, and would not elicit swelling. Microspheres were produced via a water-in-oil-in-water double-emulsion system and were loaded with rhBMP- 2 by soaking them in a buffered solution of the protein at a concentration of 5. 4 mg protein per gram of PLGA. Following recovery of the loaded microspheres by lyophilization matrices for implantation were prepared by lyophilizing a suspension of the microspheres in 2 % CMC in flat-bottom tissue culture plates. Similar matrices were made with 2 % CMC and with 2 % CMC containing blank microspheres. A full-thickness calvarial defect model in New Zealand white rabbits was used to assess bone growth. Implants fit the defect well allowing for direct application. Six weeks postsurgery, defects were collected and processed for undecalcified histology. In vitro, 60 % of the loaded rhBMP- 2 released from devices or microspheres in 5 to 7 days. With the unembedded microspheres releasing faster than those embedded in CMC In vivo. the rhBMP- 2 microspheres greatly enhanced bone healing, whereas nonloaded PLGA microspheres in the CMC implants had little effect. The results showed that a lyophilized device of rhBMP- 2 PLGA microspheres in CMC was an effective implantable protein-delivery system for the use in bone repair...|$|R
