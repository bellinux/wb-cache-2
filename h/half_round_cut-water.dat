50|$|In {{all of the}} {{algorithms}} {{the messages}} emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works {{for all of the}} VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1, and in fact the <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless in Genie algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1.|$|R
