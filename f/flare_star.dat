5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a <b>flare</b> <b>star</b> that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E

The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes {{in front of the}} primary and causes the system's apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes. UV Ceti is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two red dwarfs. both of magnitude 13.

25|$|As {{seen from}} Earth, Proxima Centauri is 2.2° {{southwest}} from Alpha Centauri AB. This is {{about four times}} the angular diameter of the Full Moon, and almost exactly half the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and Beta Centauri. Proxima usually appears as a deep-red star of an apparent visual magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field, requiring moderately sized telescopes to see. Listed as V645 Cen in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (G.C.V.S.) Version 4.2, this UV Ceti-type <b>flare</b> <b>star</b> can unexpectedly brighten rapidly {{by as much as}} 0.6 magnitudes at visual wavelengths, then fade after only a few minutes. Some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes. In August 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star occurred, with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on August 13.|$|E
25|$|For {{a planet}} around a {{red dwarf star}} to support life, it would require a rapidly {{rotating}} magnetic field {{to protect it from}} the flares. A tidally locked planet rotates only very slowly, and so cannot produce a geodynamo at its core. The violent flaring period of a red dwarf's life cycle is estimated to only last roughly the first 1.2 billion years of its existence. If a planet forms far away from a red dwarf so as to avoid tidal locking, and then migrates into the star's habitable zone after this turbulent initial period, it is possible that life may have a chance to develop. However, given its age, at 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun. It was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. Yet, in 1998, astronomers observed an intense stellar flare, surprisingly showing that Barnard's Star is, despite its age, a <b>flare</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wolf 359 is {{classified}} as a UV Ceti-type <b>flare</b> <b>star,</b> which is a star that undergoes brief, energetic increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity in the photosphere. [...] Its variable star designation is CN Leonis. [...] Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. [...] Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two-hour period, with energies of 1027 ergs (1020 joules) and higher. The mean magnetic field at the surface of Wolf 359 has a strength of about 2.2 kG (0.22 teslas), but this varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. By comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages 1 gauss (100 µT), although it can rise as high as 3 kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed emitting X-rays and gamma rays.|$|E

40|$|The VLA {{has been}} used to search for radio {{emission}} from <b>flare</b> <b>stars</b> in the Pleiades. Two observational strategies were employed. First, about 1 / 2 sq deg of cluster, containing about 40 known <b>flare</b> <b>stars,</b> was mapped at 1. 4 GHz at two epochs. More than 120 sources with flux densities greater than 0. 3 mJy exist on the maps. Detailed analysis shows that all but two of these sources are probably extragalactic. The two sources identified as stellar are probably not Pleiades members as judged by their proper motions; rather, based on their colors and magnitudes, they seem to be foreground G stars. One is a known X-ray source. The second observational strategy, where five rapidly rotating <b>flare</b> <b>stars</b> were observed at three frequencies, yielded no detections.

40|$|We {{utilize the}} Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS) HST/ACS dataset for a Deep Rapid Archival Flare Transient Search (DRAFTS) to {{constrain}} the flare rate toward the older stellar {{population in the}} Galactic bulge. During 7 days of monitoring 229, 293 stars brighter than V= 29. 5, we find evidence for flaring activity in 105 stars between V= 20 and V= 28. We divided the sample into non-variable stars and variable stars whose light curves contain large-scale variability. The flare rate on variable stars is ∼ 700 times that of non-variable stars, with a significant correlation {{between the amount of}} underlying stellar variability and peak flare amplitude. The flare energy loss rates are generally higher than those of nearby well-studied single dMe <b>flare</b> <b>stars.</b> The distribution of proper motions is consistent with the <b>flaring</b> <b>stars</b> being at the distance and age of the Galactic bulge. If they are single dwarfs, they span a range of ≈ 1. 0 - 0. 25 M. A majority of the <b>flaring</b> <b>stars</b> exhibit periodic photometric modulations with P < 3 d. If these are tidally locked magnetically active binary systems, their fraction in the bulge is enhanced by a factor of ∼ 20 compared to the local value. These stars may be useful for placing constraints on the angular momentum evolution of cool close binary stars. Our results expand the type of <b>stars</b> studied for <b>flares</b> in the optical band, and suggest that future sensitive optical time-domain studies will have to contend with a larger sample of <b>flaring</b> <b>stars</b> than the M dwarf <b>flare</b> <b>stars</b> usually considered.

40|$|The radio {{emission}} from dMe <b>flare</b> <b>stars</b> is discussed using Very Large Array and Arecibo observations as examples. Active <b>flare</b> <b>stars</b> emit weak, unpolarized, quiescent radio radiation {{that may be}} always present. Although thermal bremsstrahlung and/or thermal gyroresonance radiation account for the slowly-varying, quiescent radio radiation of solar active regions, these processes cannot account for the long-wavelength quiescent radiation observed from nearby dMe <b>flare</b> <b>stars.</b> It {{has been attributed to}} nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation, but some as yet unexplained mechanism must be continually producing the energetic electrons. Long duration, narrow-band radiation is also emitted from some nearby dMe stars at 20 cm wavelength. Such radiation may be attributed to coherent plasma radiation or to coherent electron-cyclotron masers. Impulsive stellar flares exhibit rapid variations that require radio sources that are smaller than the star in size, and high brightness temperatures greater than 10 (exp 15) K that are also explained by coherent radiation processes. Quasi-periodic temporal fluctuations suggest pulsations during some radio flares.
