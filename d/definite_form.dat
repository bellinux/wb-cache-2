5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} Louisville Democrats, {{supporters}} of U. S. Senator Jo Blackburn, {{made the first}} formal calls for a new convention. A short time after, a large meeting at Mount Sterling gave the movement a <b>definite</b> <b>form.</b> They called for a meeting in Lexington on August 2 to organize {{the details of a}} new convention. At subsequent mass meetings, it was announced that former governor John Y. Brown would accept the nomination of a second convention, should one be held. As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats. Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National Convention and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took <b>definite</b> <b>form.</b> Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, and, once he secured {{a deal in}} May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script for True Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set up as an anthology series, each season will feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E

5|$|True Detective was {{intended}} to be a novel, but once the project took <b>definite</b> <b>form,</b> Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of Galveston, and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the True Detective pilot script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter. He wrote a second True Detective script soon after his departure from The Killing thanks to the support of production company and manager Anonymous Content, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of True Detective. Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After working alone for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.|$|E

This interest in classical forms is linked to his training as a Hindustani classical vocalist and composer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was with}} the piyyutim (liturgical poems) that Jewish music began to {{crystallize}} into <b>definite</b> <b>form.</b> The cantor sang the piyyutim to melodies selected by their writer or by himself, thus introducing fixed melodies into synagogal music.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the half-part counting system in Old Russian. The half-part counting system is an Indo-European dialectism. In Old Russian it is constituted the word *polъ ‘half’ and the ordinal numeral in the genitive. The ordinal numeral in this case signified the anterior to the mentioned number of units. The article proves that the indefinite and <b>definite</b> <b>forms</b> of the ordinal numeral were strictly differentiated, not as the indefinite and <b>definite</b> <b>forms</b> of adjectives, which the ordinal numerals erroneosly identified with. In the half-part quantitative only indefinite (nominal) forms of the numerals were used, and in other cases only <b>definite</b> <b>forms</b> were used. The half-part quantitative had being preserved in Old Russian sources of different styles and genres. The changes in it began in the late Old Russian period and they showed themselves in the influence of other compositive numerals...|$|R

25|$|The {{paintings}} {{from this period}} are most remarkable for the vividness of the extreme violence and even the human denigration that is often depicted. Such representations are however, also rich in a lyrical content that was to characterise the artist from then on. The juxtaposition of the international tendencies that formed Orellana took a more <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> in this period: his old Spanish inheritance, the input from America, the wealth of archaeological culture and Italy with Conceptualism and Arte Povera. The artist had a solo show at the stand of Juana Mordo at the FIAC 1978, Paris, France. These amalgamated into a whole that {{paved the way for}} new developments in Orellana's work.|$|E
25|$|Mesrop, desirous {{to remedy}} {{this state of}} things, {{resolved}} to invent a national alphabet, in which undertaking Isaac and King Vramshapuh promised to assist him. It is hard to determine exactly what part Mesrop had in the fixing of the new alphabet. According to his Armenian biographers, he consulted Daniel, a bishop of Mesopotamia, and Rufinus, a monk of Samosata, on the matter. With their help and that of Isaac and the king, {{he was able to}} give a <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> to the alphabet, which he probably adapted from the Greek. Others, like Lenormant, think it derived from the Avestan. Mesrop's alphabet consisted of thirty-six letters; two more (long O and F) were added in the twelfth century.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

50|$|The ordinal {{numbers are}} regular {{adjectives}} in Slovene. They have only <b>definite</b> <b>forms,</b> so the masculine nominative singular ends in -i. In writing, ordinals may {{be written in}} digit form followed by a period, as in German: 1., 2., 3., 4. and so on.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} devoted to the study of a binary {{homogeneous}} mixture of an isotropic micropolar linear elastic solid with an incompressible micropolar viscous fluid. Assuming that the internal energy of the solid and the dissipation energy are positive <b>definite</b> <b>forms,</b> some uniqueness and continuous data dependence results are presented. Also, some estimates which describe the time behaviour of solution are established, provided the above two energies are positive <b>definite</b> <b>forms.</b> These estimates are used to prove that for the linearized equations, in the absence of body loads and for null boundary conditions, the solution is asymptotically stable. Then a uniqueness result under mild assumptions on the constitutive constants is given using the Lagrange–Brun identities method. These mathematical results prove that the approach of a micropolar solid–fluid mixture is in agreement with physical expectations...|$|R

500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} Allāh has been discussed extensively by classical Arab philologists. Grammarians of the Basra school regarded it as either formed [...] "spontaneously" [...] (murtajal) or as the <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> of lāh (from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of [...] "lofty" [...] or [...] "hidden"). Others held that it was borrowed from Syriac or Hebrew, but most considered it {{to be derived from}} a contraction of the Arabic definite article al- [...] "the" [...] and [...] "deity, god" [...] to [...] meaning [...] "the deity", or [...] "the God". The majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory, and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism.|$|E
500|$|The {{definite}} singular {{form of a}} noun {{is created}} by adding a suffix (-en, -n, -et or -t), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles den, det, and de are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as här ("here") or där ("there") to form den/det här (can also be [...] "denna/detta") ("this"), de här (can also be [...] "dessa") ("these"), den/det där ("that"), and de där ("those"). For example, den där fisken means [...] "that fish" [...] and refers to a specific fish; den fisken is less definite and means [...] "that fish" [...] in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while fisken means [...] "the fish". In certain cases, the <b>definite</b> <b>form</b> indicates possession, e.g., jag måste tvätta håret ("I must wash my hair").|$|E
