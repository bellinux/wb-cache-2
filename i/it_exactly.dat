25|$|The Tutte {{polynomial}} {{can also}} be computed using a deletion-contraction recurrence, but its computational complexity is high: for many values of its arguments, computing <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> is #P-complete, {{and it is also}} hard to approximate with a guaranteed approximation ratio.

25|$|The {{decision}} {{variant of}} the vertex cover problem is NP-complete, which means {{it is unlikely that}} there is an efficient algorithm to solve <b>it</b> <b>exactly.</b> NP-completeness can be proven by reduction from 3-satisfiability or, as Karp did, by reduction from the clique problem. Vertex cover remains NP-complete even in cubic graphs and even in planar graphs of degree at most 3.|$|E

His {{changes to the}} building were primarily on the interior, including a new marble double staircase and modifications to the center hall. On the outside he commissioned a copper replacement for the original wooden cupola that duplicated <b>it</b> <b>exactly.</b> The John Flanagan statue of Henry {{was placed in the}} front and the building renamed in his memory.

Roark says that if Keating promises to build <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> as designed, Roark will do it while permitting Keating {{to take all the}} credit. With prodding from the envious Toohey, the firm backing the housing project decides to alter the design presented by Keating. Roark decides, with Francon's secret help, to rig explosives to the buildings and destroy them. Roark is arrested at the site after the demolition. In order to demonstrate Roark's guilt, Toohey pressures Keating into privately confessing that Roark designed the project.|$|E

500|$|The {{animated}} {{television series}} The Simpsons references Fantasia {{in a few}} episodes. Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} franchise, expressed a wish to make a parody film named Simpstasia; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script. In [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", director David Silverman had admired the animation in Night on Bald Mountain, and made the first appearance of Devil Flanders resemble Chernabog. The episode [...] "Itchy & Scratchy Land" [...] references The Sorcerer's Apprentice in a snippet titled [...] "Scratchtasia", which features the music and several shots parodying <b>it</b> <b>exactly.</b>|$|E
500|$|Background vocals on [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] and [...] "Your Star" [...] were {{performed}} by The Millennium Choir, which {{worked with the}} band on several songs on Fallen. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said the album consists of gothic rock songs with brooding lyrics and Lee's vocals accompanied by pianos, strings and choirs. Other genres present on the album are heavy metal, opera and pop music. Jim Farber of Daily News explained, [...] "Evanescence's music again isn't quite metal (unless you think Creed qualifies). Neither is <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> pop (at {{least not in the}} current R sense of the term). But the resulting hybrid offers a genuine alternative to everything else that's out there." ...|$|E

David Colbert, {{the author of the}} book, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the Harry Potter novels [...] "are [...] literary treasure hunts for [...] readers. What seem like funny-sounding names and places and excursions into fantasy all have a basis in either history, myth or legend." [...] He added, however, that he thinks Rowling has been able to turn these elements into her own, and concluded: [...] "A couple of times, every generation, some writer gets <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> right and really makes it their own, and J.K.

500|$|Lutosławski's works {{up until}} and {{including}} the Dance Preludes clearly show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting <b>it</b> <b>exactly.</b> In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the Concerto for Orchestra. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, [...] " [...] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able", and about this change of direction he said, [...] "I was simply not so interested in it [...] ". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a [...] "post-tonal" [...] idiom: while composing the first symphony, he {{felt that this was}} for him a cul-de-sac.|$|E
500|$|Williamson's first {{professional}} work {{may have been}} helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story [...] "The World's Ugliest Horse" [...] in Eastern Color's seminal series Famous Funnies #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in New Heroic Comics #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, [...] "The Last Three Dimes", in Standard Comics' Wonder Comics #20 [...] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work, Williamson [...] "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't get it into my little brain that {{he wanted me to}} do <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> the way that he did it," [...] and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature [...] "Ka'a'nga" [...] in Fiction House's Jungle Comics.

According to VH1, {{it was the most}} popular, and most watched program in the television network's history, as Cher's presence was [...] "a huge part of making <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> that." [...] Capitalizing on the success of [...] "Believe", Cher's former record company Geffen Records released the compilation album [...] (1999), which features the previously unreleased song [...] "Don't Come Cryin' to Me". It was certified gold by the RIAA. The Do You Believe? tour ran from 1999 to 2000 and was sold out in every American city it was booked in, amassing a global audience of more than 1.5million. Its companion television special, [...] (1999), was the highest rated original HBO program in 1998–99, registering a 9.0 rating among adults 18 to 49 and a 13.0 rating in the HBO universe of about 33 million homes. In November 1999, Cher released the compilation album The Greatest Hits, which sold three million copies outside of the U.S. as of January 2000.|$|E
500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{her most}} notable {{performance}} was in George Balanchine's Tarantella. she also danced the Lead Polovtsian Girl in [...] "Polovtsian Dances" [...] from Prince Igor. In 2006, she was acknowledged for her meticulous classical performance style in Giselle {{and created a}} role in Jorma Elo's Glow–Stop. Elo said: [...] "“Often with me in my creative moments—they are very fast, and I can't repeat them myself. Misty has the capability to absorb something extremely fast and then reproduce <b>it</b> <b>exactly,</b> and she gives such clarity to the material. If I were {{to make my own}} company, she would be the first one I would call." [...] That year, she also returned to Southern California to perform at Orange County Performing Arts Center and danced one of the cygnets and reprised her role as the Hungarian Princess in Swan Lake in New York. In both 2006 and 2007, Copeland danced the role of Blossom in James Kudelka's Cinderella. Copeland's [...] "old-style" [...] performance continued to earn her praise in 2007. In 2007, she danced the Fairy of Valor in The Sleeping Beauty. Other roles that Copeland played before she was appointed a soloist by ABT included Twyla Tharp roles in In the Upper Room and Sinatra Suite as well as a role in Mark Morris's Gong. A Dance Magazine feature stated that Copeland's [...] "sublime rapport with her partners in ... Sinatra Suite has earned her the honor of dancing with the company’s male superstars".|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the album}} began September 6, 2010, lasting for eleven weeks, each one {{focusing}} on a particular song, something Vig stated [...] "was good because each song kinda had its own life". The recordings started with Grohl's rhythm guitar and Taylor Hawkins' drumming to provide the foundations and see if both could [...] "lock in". Hawkins usually played for hours before he got [...] "a drum track I'd be proud of". Click tracks were used, but Vig {{said that there was}} not a worry for the drums to follow <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> as they [...] "wanted it to groove" [...] and [...] "we realized that when everything is off just a few milliseconds, the sound gets wider and thicker." [...] After the guitar and drum track, Mendel would play his basslines, which were practiced enough for them to be recorded perfectly on the first take. The following day, Shiflett and Smear would play guitars, with the latter being the last and usually being given a baritone guitar to have a different sound from the other guitarists. After the instrumental backing was ready, Grohl did the vocals either on the control room or the isolation booth. As Grohl wanted the songs [...] "to have maximum emotional potential", the vocals were screamed to the point he had headaches—"when the mic is picking up every tiny inconsistency, you really strain to make it sound right." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play <b>it</b> <b>exactly</b> as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E
