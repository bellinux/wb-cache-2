5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> {{she checks}} the {{rear-view}} mirror, {{her face in}} the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up {{to her in the}} Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear before <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in Sierra Leone, Africa where young girls are {{mutilated}} every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million. Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like Sande and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country. At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> she was mutilated, the women sang, danced, and clap ceremoniously. According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls who are trained to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing. The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.|$|E
500|$|Doggett tells Reyes that, {{in order}} to resolve the situation, she must turn off his {{respirator}} and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes {{to go back to}} her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> she shuts off Doggett's respirator. [...] As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{said that}} the video {{continues}} the visual representation of Spears' relationship with the paparazzi and her public image, as previously seen in the videos for [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004) and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2008), but [...] "the new clip is arguably her most playful yet." [...] Amos Barshad of New York stated the video [...] "is awe-inspiring in almost exactly the way it intended to be" [...] and that [...] "the spirit of the song, {{as reflected in the}} video, is that of free will and dream fulfillment {{in the face of a}} repressive society." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented that [...] "Britney displays the sass and charm fans fell in love with a decade ago during performance shots, where she flirts with the camera, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> big and wide as her smile." [...] An editor for VH1 called the video [...] "fan-freakin'-tastic" [...] and compared it favorably to the music video for Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2011), saying that [...] "they share a silly temperament, a flirty star, and funny cameos. Upon closer examination, though, Britney's video blows Katy Perry's out of the water." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states {{that you can get}} in when you are in love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> the screen cuts to black.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} edit of {{the music}} video begins with a message to those fans that sent in their videos; [...] "Thank you {{to all those who}} chose to share their stories with the world." [...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of me about my race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the sofa, with tears in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks.|$|E

2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
