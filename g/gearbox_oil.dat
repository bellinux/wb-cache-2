40|$|In {{accordance}} with waste strategy for Turkey, {{the study was}} carried out to analyses waste engine crankcase <b>oils</b> and waste <b>gearbox</b> <b>oils</b> generated from vehicle maintenance services {{in order to determine}} their suitability for recycling, recovery or final disposal based on regulation published by Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry on 21 January 2004. The regulation requires all waste oil neither abandoned nor released into the environment and all batches must be analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, chlorine, total halogens, polychlorinated biphenyls, and flash points. The content analysis showed that the heavy metal concentrations in waste engine crankcase oils were varied considerably, between the metals analyzed, lead the highest is followed by chromium, arsenic and cadmium. In addition, higher amount of chlorine and total halogens, were detected in some samples, while polychlorinated biphenyls concentrations remained below regulatory limits for all samples. The analyses revealed that waste engine crankcase oils from fifteen to thirty five years old vehicles contained chromium, lead, chlorine and total halogens levels above legal limits set by Ministry of Environment and Forestry for recycling. Conversely, in comparison to the findings from the analyzed series of old vehicles, the waste engine crankcase oils samples from new vehicles and all waste <b>gearbox</b> <b>oils</b> are eligible for recycling...|$|R

50|$|The {{race was}} {{dramatically}} {{won by the}} Ron Hodgson Motors entered Holden LH Torana SL/R 5000 L34 of Bob Morris and British driver John Fitzpatrick. The car slowed in the final laps trailing smoke but made to the finish. Television commentators and motoring journalists reported {{at the time that}} the Torana had broken an axle plus was having engine problems which accounted for the smoke. It was only later did the teams chief mechanic Bruce Richardson discover that there was no broken axle or engine trouble. What was actually slowing the car was a blown <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> seal. The oil was leaking out onto the clutch causing it to slip badly. Second on the same lap was Holden Dealer Team Torana L34 of Colin Bond and John Harvey. Brothers Peter and Phil Brock in the Bill Patterson entered Torana L34 completed a second consecutive podium clean sweep for the Torana L34. In fact, Torana L34s filled the top seven places.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} fairly uneventful. Reutemann {{was passed by}} Didier Pironi going into the first corner. Then Alan Jones nudged off Nelson Piquet at {{the early stages of}} the race and Piquet crashed into some catch fencing at the chicane. A few laps later, Jones's gearbox failed, and he {{ploughed}} into the barriers and badly burned his left thigh after the <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> leaked into his cockpit. Following Jones's retirement Piquet, still furious after their previous incident, stormed to the Williams garage and had an altercation with Jones and the Williams personnel. Pironi had fallen back and after Jones's accident, Reutemann took the lead, and kept the lead until the race was called off early because of rain starting to fall on the track. A sombre Reutemann took his second victory of the season and his 12th and what was to be the final victory of his enigmatic career after a weekend that was marked by frustration, politics and tragedy.|$|E
50|$|Prost {{continued}} to chase Senna despite the misfire, his full boost run saw him {{able to stay}} within 5 seconds of the Brazilian, though at no stage did he truly threaten his team mate. Berger had initially given chase and stayed {{within a couple of}} seconds of Prost, but before lap 10 had started to drop back in order to save fuel. By lap 30 the Frenchman had reduced Senna's lead to only 2 seconds, but as he went by the pits at the end of lap 30 the misfire suddenly got worse and by lap 35 had been passed by Berger and Alboreto and was heading for the pits and his first mechanical retirement of the season (and the only time in 1988 that a McLaren would retire due to engine failure). While this was happening Alboreto, troubled by gear selection problems early in the race, had dropped back from Berger to allow his <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> to cool hoping it would come good. It did and the Italian in the All-Italian car began to charge at the Italian Grand Prix, and was catching his team mate.|$|E

40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} destructive contaminations to lubricants which in turn lead to more power consumption and early damage to rotating machines. This study explores the effect of water contents in <b>gearbox</b> lube <b>oil</b> on the responses of electrical supply parameters. A two stage gearbox based mechanical transmission system driven by a sensorless variable speed drive (VSD) is utilised to investigate experimentally any measurable changes in these signals that can be correlated with water contamination levels. Results show that the supply parameters obtained from both external measurements and the VSD control data can be correlated to the contamination levels of oil with water and hence can be based on for an instant diagnosis of water contamination. Particularly, the voltage and hence the power responses are more sensitive to the water contents than that of current because the VSD regulates more the voltage to adapt the small load changes due to the water induced lubrication degradation. Simultaneously, vibration also shows changes which agree with that of power supply parameters...|$|R
50|$|TSB {{identified}} a broken titanium stud {{as part of}} the <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> filter assembly. Sikorsky had previously recommended that the titanium stud be replaced with a steel stud within one year or 1,250 flight hours of a 28 January 2009 Alert Service Bulletin, following a total loss of oil and emergency landing in Australia in August 2008. On 21 March Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, indicated that it would release an Airworthiness Directive calling for the replacement of the studs on other S-92A aircraft, most likely on Monday 23 March, but that the Directive would apply only to US-registered helicopters. The FAA had issued previous Airworthiness Directives AD 2005-12-03, AD 2006-11-14, and AD 2006-15-19 for problems with the main gearbox of that type.http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet The FAA had also issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) number SW-09-19 Sikorsky S92A Main Gearbox Emergency Procedures dated 19 March 2009. The SAIB indicated that a recent procedural change, Sikorsky Safety Advisory (SSA) SSA-S92-08-006, dated 26 September 2008 may not have been appropriate and that it had not been approved. The European Aviation Safety Agency had already acted to highlight this problem.|$|E
50|$|In most {{automatic}} transmissions, {{the drive}} turbine only functions as an input to the transmission where {{the power is}} redirected to gears in its automatic gearbox. Turboglide differs by using three individual drive turbines, each connected to a different ratio inside the <b>gearbox.</b> <b>Oil</b> leaving the pump first strikes the turbine connected to the Low (first gear) ratio. The design of the turbine permits oil to pass through its blades and strike the next turbine in line, the one connected to the Intermediate ratio, which receives some of the energy remaining in the oil flow. After leaving the intermediate turbine, the oil is passed to the direct turbine which is direct drive at drive shaft speed. As the car starts from rest, the low turbine, which has the greatest gear reduction ratio {{is relatively easy to}} bring up to match pump (engine) speed and the car starts from rest easily and accelerates quickly. While this occurs, the intermediate turbine receives an ever increasing share of the energy from the pump, as the Low turbine moves faster and oil passes more freely through it. Eventually, the low turbine matches pump speed, and the low turbine freewheels on a one-way sprag clutch much like on a bicycle. At this point, the intermediate turbine is carrying the majority of the drive force, and some energy is being sent to the direct turbine from the oil passing through the intermediate turbine as it also begins to match pump speed. Eventually, the intermediate turbine also matches pump speed, and the oil passes freely through low and intermediate turbines to drive the direct turbine alone, in direct drive (1:1 ratio). Because of the overlapping power input in different ratios, there is no 'shift' or sequential gearing, rather there is a concurrent geared drive, in effect the car starts out in 1-2-3, eventually drops 1 to be in 2-3 and eventually drops 2 to be in 3 alone.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out on the {{feasibility}} of using nondispersive infra-red (NDIR) analysis for online condition monitoring of the degradation of wind turbine <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil.</b> In particular, the effects of varying the size of the gap through which the oil flows was analysed, with considerably larger gaps of 1 - 3 mm used than reported elsewhere. Due to the high viscosity of <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil,</b> a large gap size is desirable for online monitoring. Old and new oil were found to produce a different output from the detector, suggesting that online condition monitoring of oil using NDIR is viable with large gap sizes, although the largest gap size produced some anomalous results...|$|E

Ickx was closing, and his Firestones were getting better as the race went on. On lap 43, the Belgian set the fastest lap of the race, and the gap was down to 2.2 seconds. Then, on lap 49, the Ferrari's alternator fell off, punching {{a hole in the}} <b>gearbox</b> and spilling <b>oil</b> all over the track! Hulme hit the oil and spun into the barrier, bending his front suspension. He was standing beside the track when Cevert came by and also hit the barrier, but kept going, now 29 seconds in the lead! ...|$|R
5000|$|Gear oil has a {{characteristic}} aroma {{due to the}} addition of sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical gear cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight cut spur gears). On motorcycles with [...] "wet" [...] clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating {{the lower part of}} the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original Mini placed the <b>gearbox</b> in the <b>oil</b> sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.|$|R
50|$|The {{freewheel}} {{meant that}} the engine returned to its idle speed on the overrun, thus greatly reducing noise from both the engine and <b>gearbox</b> and reducing <b>oil</b> consumption. The mechanism could usually be locked to provide engine braking if needed. A freewheel was also used in the original Land Rover vehicle from 1948 to 1951. The freewheel controlled drive from the gearbox to the front axle, which disengaged on the overrun. This allowed the vehicle to have a permanent 4 wheel drive system by avoiding 'wind-up' forces in the transmission. This system worked, but produced unpredictable handling, especially in slippery conditions or when towing, {{and was replaced by}} a conventional selectable 4WD system.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{tribological}} performance and compatibility of hydrogenated amorphous carbon coating (a-C:H) and metal-doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating (Me-C:H) with formulated oils under the boundary lubrication regime was investigated. The investigation employed ball-on-flat contact geometry in reciprocating sliding motion and six formulated oils (manual <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil,</b> automatic <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil,</b> hydraulic oil, compressor oil, andnormal and high performance motor oil), with pure poly-alpha-olefin (PAO) oil {{used as a}} reference. In addition, DLC coatings behavior in diesel and gasoline fuel was evaluated. Compared with the uncoated steel surfaces a-C:H coatings give improved wear resistance in base PAO {{as well as in}} fully formulated oils and fuels. On the other hand, W-doped DLC coatings show the lowest steady-state friction under boundary lubrication, especially when using oils with high additive contents...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{have been}} widely installed in many areas, especially in remote locations on land or offshore. Routine inspection and maintenance of wind turbines {{has become a challenge}} in order to improve reliability and reduce the energy of cost; thus adopting an efficient condition monitoring approach of wind turbines is desirable. This paper adopts extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms to achieve condition monitoring of wind turbines based on a model-based condition monitoring approach. Compared with the traditional gradient-based training algorithm widely used in the single-hidden layer feed forward neural network, ELM can randomly choose the input weights and hidden biases and need not be tuned in the training process. Therefore, ELM algorithm can dramatically reduce learning time. Models are identified using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data acquired from an operational wind farm, which contains data of the temperature of <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> sump, <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> exchange and generator winding. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently identify faults of wind turbines...|$|E
40|$|We {{have created}} an {{accelerated}} corrosion environment for sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets in e-motor applications. E-motor working conditions are complex, and standard magnet corrosion tests only cover a small subset of possible parameters (e. g., samples are usually tested in the demagnetized state). In this work magnetized and demagnetized sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets were placed in <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil,</b> and exposed to temperature cycles (θmax[*]=[*] 130 [*]°C) using an autoclave. Beforehand the magnets were pre-immersed in saturated water-based salt solution to account for water and de-icing salt that might interfuse <b>gearbox</b> <b>oil</b> over time. The corrosive behavior was studied for two commercial magnet grades, “high grade” (8. 9 [*]wt% dysprosium) and “low grade” (3. 1 [*]wt% dysprosium); and monitored by weight loss, structural analysis (scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray) as well as magnetic characterization. The magnetized samples corroded significantly faster than their demagnetized counterparts. Strong differences in the corrosion rates of the “low grade” and “high grade” material are discussed. We concluded that the magnetization state is one key parameter {{that needs to be}} considered in corrosion tests for e-motor applications...|$|E
50|$|There {{was a big}} {{accident}} on the pit straight involving Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese, this accident was to affect {{the outcome of the}} race. The accident happened right after Piquet and Patrese crossed the start/finish line, Piquet attempted to pass Patrese, the two cars touched and Patrese crashed violently and collected Piquet, whose Brabham's rear suspension broke during the collision before Patrese collected Piquet. The cars then spun into the run-off at the first corner; both drivers were unhurt. Patrese's <b>gearbox</b> dropped <b>oil</b> onto the track which took out Niki Lauda who while sliding off on the oil managed to avoid hitting anything, he stalled his engine and was out on the spot. The crash also nearly took out the closely following Jacques Laffite and Teo Fabi, while race leader Michele Alboreto also slid wide on the oil; Alboreto's off handed the lead to Alain Prost. Alboreto drove a hard race; he eventually caught and passed Prost 3 laps later, but was re-passed by Prost after he punctured his left rear tyre at the first corner where Piquet and Patrese crashed. This dropped him to 4th behind Andrea De Cesaris, Elio de Angelis and Prost; he caught and passed his compatriots but could not catch Prost; who despite a leaking turbo wastegate, had kept the gap wide enough for Alboreto to be unable to catch him in the remaining laps.|$|R
30|$|Vibration sensing is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used online monitoring technique because of its rugged cost-effective, but the sensing quantity is an indirect indicator of gearbox condition due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the sensing measurement. On the other hand, oil debris analysis, as a direct sensing method, provides an alternative solution by offline inspection of the <b>gearbox</b> condition. The <b>oil</b> debris measurements can directly indicate the machinery condition with high accuracy. An oil debris analysis was performed by Bolander et al. (2009) to estimate the spall size as the damage progressed in aircraft engine prognosis. It can be found that oil debris monitoring is suitable to provide an early indication and quantification of internal damage of a gearbox, but it is far from convenient or cost-effective because of high cost and human intervention requirements during normal operations of gearboxes.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the costs of wind energy, it is {{necessary}} to improve the wind turbine availability and reduce the operational and maintenance costs. The reliability and availability of a functioning wind turbine depend largely on the protective properties of the lubrication oil for its drive train subassemblies such as gearbox and means for lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection. The wind industry currently uses lubrication oil analysis for detecting gearbox and bearing wear but cannot detect the functional failures of the lubrication oils. The main purpose of lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection is to determine whether the oils have deteriorated {{to such a degree that}} they no longer fulfill their functions. This paper describes a research on developing online lubrication oil health condition monitoring and remaining useful life prediction with particle filtering technique using commercially available online sensors. The paper first presents a survey on current state-of-the-art online lubrication oil condition monitoring solutions and their characteristics along with the classification and evaluation of each technique. It is then followed by an investigation on wind turbine <b>gearbox</b> lubrication <b>oil</b> health condition monitoring and degradation detection using online viscosity and dielectric constant sensors. In particular, the lubricant performance evaluation and remaining useful life prediction of degraded lubrication oil with viscosity and dielectric constant data using particle filtering are presented.
