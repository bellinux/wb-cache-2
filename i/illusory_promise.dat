Viceroy José Fernando de Abascal sent troops from Lima to repress the revolt and seized this opportunity to decree the reannexation of Upper Peru to his jurisdiction of Peru. Royalists there formed a clear majority, even among americanos. Elites in Lima, in particular, whose wealth and influence had declined since the Bourbon repartitioning of South America, placed their hopes not in the seemingly <b>illusory</b> <b>promises</b> of liberation but rather in the rewards they could secure through fidelity to the Crown. Murillo and the other leaders were beheaded and their heads exhibited to the people as deterrent.|$|R

50|$|An <b>illusory</b> <b>promise,</b> or {{one which}} the {{promisor}} actually has {{no obligation to}} keep, does not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the contract, placing duties on the promisor. For instance, if a promisor promises to give away {{a third of his}} earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.|$|E
50|$|Escape clauses {{that require}} a {{purchaser}} or an expert representing the purchaser {{to be satisfied with}} the goods or services being purchased have been attacked in lawsuits as invalid for lack of consideration. The argument is that a party can always escape such a contract by merely claiming to be unsatisfied. Therefore, there is no real requirement for that party to perform their obligations under the contract (to pay for the goods or services), and an agreement that only requires performance by one party is an <b>illusory</b> <b>promise,</b> void as a contract. Instead, such an agreement constitutes a gift from the performing party to the non-performing party.|$|E

The court held that the contract did have mutuality of obligation because the contract constrained Price's discretion. Price was required to buy all the sand that he would sell from McMichael, so if he {{wanted to be in the}} sand business he was bound to buy from McMichael.

5000|$|Many {{contracts}} include [...] "satisfaction clauses", {{in which}} a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn't subjectively satisfied with the promisee's performance. Strictly speaking, this is an <b>illusory</b> <b>promise,</b> since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to. However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied. As another example, if a contract promises a promisee {{a certain percentage of}} the proceeds of a promisor's business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn't have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero. However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing. [...] The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires [...] "best efforts" [...] in such contracts. This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty.|$|E

6000|$|So Tom went on even to {{the fifth}} half-year--till he was turned sixteen--at King's Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity which her aunts {{considered}} highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss's boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with cousin Lucy for her companion. In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to Philip, and asked many questions about him, which were answered by brief sentences about Tom's toothache, and a turf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other items of that kind. She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross. They were no longer very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad, he answered: [...] "Well, it isn't my fault; I don't do anything to him." [...] She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside, and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of St. Ogg's. When they did meet, she remembered her promise to kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school, she knew now that such a greeting {{was out of the}} question, and Philip would not expect it. The promise was void, like so many other sweet, <b>illusory</b> <b>promises</b> of our childhood; void as promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew {{side by side with the}} ripening peach,--impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed.|$|R
40|$|Often {{seen as a}} minor {{figure of}} the failed proletarian {{movement}} of the 19302 ̆ 7 s, Kenneth Fearing (1902 - 1961) devoted his career to warning his readers against the dangers of modern American corporate life: the sacrifices of individualism and creative, satisfying work; the loss of faith and trust for others at work; the sacrifices of family love and security at home. These losses are accomplished through corporate control of language and mass media communication systems symbolized in Fearing 2 ̆ 7 s work by huge electronic, publishing, advertising, and public relations corporations. Fearing 2 ̆ 7 s work seeks to reaffirm humanism and individualism through the often frightening images of their opposites [...] the lives {{of men and women}} who have lost these precious gifts to the <b>illusory</b> <b>promises</b> of corporate success. ^ Fearing 2 ̆ 7 s corporate conspiracy literature draws from several major historical, political, aesthetic, and literary traditions. His work contains the graphic realism and anti-business violence of naturalism and the muckrakers 2 ̆ 7 call for reform. His portraits of the 2 ̆ 2 executive type 2 ̆ 2 draw upon the historical and literary figure of the unfulfilled businessman. His compassion for individualism and artistic freedom is an expression of the independent radicalism and Marxist humanism of the proletarian movement of the thirties. The atmosphere of crisis that dominates his work comes from the suspense and political intrigue of the thriller genre. Finally, Fearing 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the close, affective relationship between a writer and his readers places his work in the tradition of reader response theory. ^ Kenneth Fearing never abandoned his attempts to warn us against the dangers of corporate conspiracy. His deep compassion and concern for us never weakened: even in the darker pessimism of the anti-McCarthyism that dominated his later work, his voice of dissent against corporate conspiracy was never silenced. This study seeks to reclaim for Kenneth Fearing 2 ̆ 7 s life and work their proper place in the history of American literary radicalism. ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the middle}} of the 16th century, some of the {{inhabitants}} descended to the valley to erect permanent housing there, giving rise to the frazioni Roccasecca Centro, Castello, and Caprile. In the ensuing centuries the rocca of Roccasecca passed between the Angevin kings of Naples or the Aragonese, in intermittent contention with the Papal States, for the resulting power over the Valle del Liri. Only in 1583 did Roccasecca gain some permanent security, when the Counts of Aquino sold the rights to Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora, the illegitimate son of Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni), who made of {{it for the first time}} a Papal fief. In the 17th century Roccasecca fell with the remainder of southern Italy into Spanish Habsburg control.

40|$|Unilateral-modification clauses {{give one}} party the {{unfettered}} right to amend or reject the underlying contract, often with neither notice to nor consent {{from the other}} party. State and federal courts are divided {{on the issue of}} whether employment arbitration agreements subject to such clauses are enforceable (and the courts holding the arbitration agreements are unenforceable are divided on which of several contract law doctrines apply). The majority of courts refuse to compel arbitration when the employer 2 ̆ 7 s unilateral-modification rights create a lack of consideration, a non-mutual agreement, an <b>illusory</b> <b>promise</b> to arbitrate, or an unconscionable agreement. A minority of courts find that the promise of continued employment is adequate consideration and that arbitration agreements containing unilateral-modification clauses are enforceable. This article argues that an employer 2 ̆ 7 s promise of continued at-will employment is illusory and therefore, by itself does not supply consideration for an employee 2 ̆ 7 s promise to arbitrate. The article also argues that under existing contract law doctrines, arbitration agreements subject to unrestricted unilateral-modification provisions should not be enforceable. However, courts should permit employers to retain the ability to unilaterally modify arbitration agreements so long as the agreements provide employees with (1) adequate notice of changes, (2) sufficient consideration for the promise to arbitrate, and (3) conscionable arbitration terms. Courts can overlay this three-step framework onto existing contract doctrines to fairly and consistently analyze the enforceability of unilateral-modification clauses in employment arbitration agreements...|$|E
40|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s landmark 2008 ruling in Medellin v. Texas, critics attacked the Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding as deeply inconsistent with the original understanding of treaty interpretation. This Article carefully reexamines the interrelationship between the late-eighteenth century law of nations, the framing and ratification of the federal Constitution, and the practices of the early Supreme Court. In uniting these threads, it reveals a link-patent and remarkable-between the late eighteenth-century law of nations, the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s decision to vest treaty interpretation in the judiciary, and the methods of treaty interpretation employed by the Supreme Court in the early republic. Textual treaty interpretation-textualism in all but name-was thought to be a requirement of the law of nations at the time of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s adoption. The Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Framers-who knew the law of nations 2 ̆ 7 interpretive rules-invested treaty interpretation in the judiciary for precisely this reason, designing the federal judiciary to allow independent and expert judges to interpret treaties textually even if that meant that such interpretations went against the interests of the United States. The Supreme Court, through the end of the Marshall era, did precisely as the Framers intended, holding to a muscular textualism, citing often to interpretive rules embedded in the law of nations as it did so. Ultimately, this historical reexamination uncovers a fascinating story about the interplay between interpretive expectations and constitutional and institutional design. The law of nations 2 ̆ 7 requirement that treaties be interpreted textually allowed the young United States the opportunity to bind its own hands and thereby obtain the credibility necessary to deal with European powers on equal footing. Vesting treaty interpretation in the judiciary meant the United States 2 ̆ 7 treaty commitments would be honored as a matter of positive law. But this strategy depended in no small measure on an ability to signal to other nations precisely how those treaties would be interpreted. The law of nations 2 ̆ 7 requirement that treaty interpretation be rule-bound and textual made the United States 2 ̆ 7 decision to invest treaty interpretation in the judiciary more than an <b>illusory</b> <b>promise.</b> It assured other nations their commitments would be honored according to international maxims of interpretation well-settled and widely-known...|$|E
40|$|In {{examining}} one of documentary's greatest taboos, {{the recording}} of actual death, this dissertation engages with the moving image's temporality, its potential to preserve the past, and the major impact of its technological shifts on American visual culture. While film's technological limitations and expense make it a difficult medium for capturing death, the digital age's affordable and user-friendly cameras - along with DVD and YouTube distribution - support previously unfeasible projects. More accessible than ever, documentary death footage evokes a fundamental issue of film and digital media: the <b>illusory</b> <b>promise</b> that we can preserve what we record. In the face of death's finality, this promise is achingly seductive; {{but it is also}} rife with cognitive dissonance, since the moment saved is a person's last. A documented death is simultaneously a rare memento mori in a death-denying age and a pledge that some spectral form of immortality is possible - that we can hold on to what would otherwise be lost and retrieve it anew with each viewing. The first half of my dissertation historicizes death in documentary film and photography from 1839 - 1975 and then analyzes digital-era documentaries on natural death. The combination exposes a cultural fixation on the "moment" of violent death, {{at the expense of the}} process of dying that typifies the end of life in modern America. In the second half, my study of duration shifts to the technology itself, identifying distinctive digital temporalities. Digital technology can record for very long periods and at very little cost, as it does in the 10, 000 hours of footage shot to capture Golden Gate Bridge suicides for The Bridge, a work whose innovation and ethical transgressions both lie in its sublime aesthetics. In contrast to this capacity for length, death footage distributed on YouTube must be brief and spectacle-oriented to succeed, and is often stripped of cultural and political circumstances. Paying close attention to both content and contexts, I argue that the burgeoning combination of death and the digital illuminates crucial qualities of each. Death's totality remains beyond representation, as even advanced technologies can capture it only in fragments, but digital media's partial successes - or instructive failures - in documenting death highlight unique digital temporalities. Further, I make an intervention in reigning theories of the digital as "disembodied" or "immaterial" by emphasizing the visceral impact of watching this bodily transformation - an impact not dulled by our awareness that digital images are transmitted algorithmically rather than indexically...|$|E
40|$|This chapter olfers a {{long-term}} perspective on citizenship, questioning one on 'the busic assunptions {{of most of}} the literature on this topic, that is, the nation-stale as unit of analysis. Through the adoption of a world-systemic perspective, two basic aspects of the history of cilizenship stand out. Firsrty, the fundamentally exclusive nature of this category, as it emerged and developed over the history of the modern world-system, since at least the "long l 6 th Century". And, secondly, that well before the so-called "information revolution" of the last decades, "technology" has shaped the Western social imagination, acting, in various and changing historical forms, as an effective instrument of control and supremacy, producing asymmetric and inegalitarian effects, and providing a yardstick of the different "levels of development" of Western and non-Western peoples. In this view, the most recent phase of the history of citizenship, his e-form, seems to replicate, in new ways, the explanations of the gap existing both between and within countries - now conceplualized as "digital divide" - and, at the same time, the <b>illusory</b> universalistic <b>promise</b> of an expansion of the citizenship and the rights associated to it...|$|R
60|$|But this fair {{prospect}} {{was soon}} {{destined to be}} overcast. Questions of detail arose which, when closely examined, proved to be matters of very essential importance. The Uitlanders and British South Africans, who had experienced in the past how <b>illusory</b> the <b>promises</b> of the President might be, insisted upon guarantees. The seven years offered were two years more than that which Sir Alfred Milner had declared to be an irreducible minimum. The difference of two years would not have hindered their acceptance, even {{at the expense of}} some humiliation to our representative. But there were conditions which excited distrust when drawn up by so wily a diplomatist. One was that the alien who aspired to burghership had to produce a certificate of continuous registration for a certain time. But the law of registration had fallen into disuse in the Transvaal, and consequently this provision might render the whole Bill valueless. Since it was carefully retained, it was certainly meant for use. The door had been opened, but a stone was placed to block it. Again, the continued burghership of the new-comers was made to depend upon the resolution of the first Raad, so that should the mining members propose any measure of reform, not only their Bill but they also might be swept out of the house by a Boer majority. What could an Opposition do if a vote of the Government might at any moment unseat them all? It was clear that a measure which contained such provisions must be very carefully sifted before a British Government could accept it as a final settlement and a complete concession of justice to its subjects. On the other hand, it naturally felt loth to refuse those clauses which offered some prospect of an amelioration in their condition. It took the course, therefore, of suggesting that each Government should appoint delegates to form a joint commission which should inquire into the working of the proposed Bill before it was put into a final form. The proposal was submitted to the Raad on August 7, with the addition that when this was done Sir Alfred Milner was prepared to discuss anything else, including arbitration without the interference of foreign powers.|$|R
