In this paper, a new empirical model for the dayside electron density of the martian ionosphere (primary and secondary layer), called NeMars, is described. The model is mainly based on MARSIS AIS data (Active <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> from the Mars Advanced Radar and <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> experiment aboard Mars Express mission) {{and to a lesser}} extent on radio occultation data from the Mars Global Surveyor mission.

The model partially assumes the Chapman theory, the scale height for the main layer of the model varies with the solar zenith angle and the altitude, and the Chapman-like photochemical processes dominate diffusion up to about 200 km altitude. In addition, we assess the level of importance that parameters like heliocentric distance, solar longitude, solar activity or solar zenith angle have on the formation of the ionosphere.

The observations were made by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> (MARSIS) aboard Mars Express, in its Active <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> mode. During several orbits on June 2006, the ionosphere showed an unusual behaviour, characterised by a compression of the plasma above the main ionospheric peak as observed by the topside total electron content, the plasma scale height, and the local plasma in the Mars Express surroundings. The compression was most likely due to an induced magnetic field originating from the solar wind and measured by the MARSIS antennas, which was able to penetrate into the ionosphere. In particular, for several profiles, the density distribution can be clearly defined by two different plasma scale heights, which indicates a transition region between both of them. From the balance of magnetic and thermal plasma pressures and from a comparison with a numerical model of the Martian ionosphere, the hypothesis of a penetrating induced magnetic field down to a transition altitude around 150 km is confirmed.

40|$|The {{response}} of the Martian ionosphere to solar activity is analyzed by taking into account variations {{in a range of}} parameters during 4 phases of the solar cycle throughout 2005 - 2012. Multiple Mars Express datasets have been used (such as Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> (MARSIS) in Active <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> (AIS), MARSIS subsurface and MaRS radio science), which currently cover more than 10 [*]years of solar activity. The topside of the main ionospheric layer behavior is empirically modeled through the neutral scale height parameter, which describes the density distribution in altitude, and {{can be used as a}} dynamic monitor of the solar wind-Martian plasma interaction, as well as of the medium's temperature. The main peak, the total electron content, and the relationship between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the maximum thermal pressure of the ionosphere with the solar cycle are assessed. We conclude that the neutral scale height was different in each phase of the solar cycle, having a large variation with solar zenith angle during the moderate ascending and high phases, while there is almost no variation during the moderate descending and low phases. Between end- 2007 to end- 2009, an almost permanent absence of secondary layer resulted because of the low level of solar X-rays. Also, the ionosphere was more likely to be found in a more continuously magnetized state. The induced magnetic field from the solar wind, even if weak, could be strong enough to penetrate more than at other solar cycle phases. Peer-reviewedPublished (publisher PDF...|$|R

The technique used in this paper is a novel "transmission-mode'' sounding of the ionosphere of Mars in contrast to the Active <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> experiment (AIS) on MARSIS, which generally operates in the reflection mode. This technique yields a global map of the TEC for the Martian ionosphere. The radar transmits a wideband chirp signal that travels through the ionosphere before and after being reflected from the surface. The received waves are attenuated, delayed and dispersed, depending on the electron density in the column directly below the spacecraft.
