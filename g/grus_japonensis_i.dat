40|$|We {{report the}} {{distribution}} and habitat selection by the Red-crowned Crane <b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis</b> in winter in the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, China. Including original wetlands and artificial habitats, six types of habitat are used by the species: saltworks (salinas), fish ponds, reed beds, Wormwood Artemisia halodendron beaches, tidal grasslands and wheat fields. We compared the habitat availability with habitat use in each type. In winter, Red-crowned Crane preferentially used tidal grasslands and fish ponds. Saltworks, Wormwood beaches and wheat fields were avoided. The distribution of Red-crowned Crane in different types of habitat changed with the distribution of freshwater and with human activities...|$|R

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been undertaken to design nature reserves, there are few practical methods to determine the interior structure of a reserve. A procedure for design of the core zone in reserves is proposed. As a case study, the core zone in Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, People&# 39;s Republic of China, which was established to preserve the endangered red crowned crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis)</b> is designed. A statistical habitat model using geographic information system (GIS) is developed to predict crane presence or absence. Based on predicted suitable habitats, the minimum core zone is defined. More suitable habitats can be contained in the designated core zone, {{and this will be}} beneficial to the conservation and restoration for crane habitats. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Cheorwon-gun is an {{important}} wintering area for the red-crowned crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis).</b> Although eco-tourism has been recently proposed {{as a means to}} stimulate the local economy, it may have adverse effects on the crane. We believe a science-based conservation plan is needed to mitigate these negative effects. To this end, our study had three objectives: (1) to analyze the red-crowned crane habitat and its suitability in Cheorwon-gun, using field surveys and habitat modeling; (2) to check the feasibility of alternative habitat patches across demilitarized zones (DMZs); and (3) to propose a conceptual diagram that minimizes habitat loss during development activities. We aim to quantify habitat suitability, the farmland area needed to support existing crane populations in wintertime, disturbance caused by human activities, and vehicular spatial patterns. These data could be used in spatial planning. The framework of this study and the process of making a conceptual diagram could be applied to other areas where there is a conflict between development and habitat conservation. demilitarized zone; maximum entropy model; alternative habitats; presence dat...|$|R
40|$|The Red-crowned crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis)</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} birds in East Asia which is among the rarest and {{endangered}} cranes in the world. In order to enhance population management and further conservation of Red-crowned cranes, researchers compared behavioural changes from wild population to captive population. Meanwhile, researchers also compared the artificial inbred population with the natural normal populations. In this research, five main behavioural patterns of Red-crowned cranes include resting, moving, preening, feeding and alerting were identified by all occurrence sampling and instantaneous scanning sampling methods with 5 - 10 min intervals. The referred wild and captive populations were concluded from the previous publications and the artificial inbred populations were observed in Hangzhou Wildlife Park (China) during August and September, 2009. As a result, researchers found the difference (p> 0. 05) between wild and captive populations is not significant. However, preening in captive population is higher than in wild population. The wild population spent more time for resting compared to captive population yet feeding is the most time-spent behaviours for both populations. Furthermore, behavioural patterns between normal and inbred populations are found significantly different (p< 0. 05). Alerting and resting behaviours are significantly higher in the normal population than in inbred population. Moreover, moving is the dominant behaviour of inbred population but feeding is taken the most time by normal population...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{previous}} research on anti-predation vigilance in groups has assumed independent scanning for threats among group members. Alternative patterns {{that are based on}} monitoring the vigilance levels of companions can also be adaptive. Coordination of vigilance, in which foragers avoid scanning {{at the same time as}} others, should decrease the odds that no group member is alert. Synchronisation of vigilance implies that individuals are more likely to be vigilant when companions are already vigilant. While synchronisation will increase the odds that no one is vigilant, it may allow a better assessment of potential threats. We investigated temporal sequences of vigilance in family flocks consisting of two parents and at most two juveniles in two species of cranes in coastal China. We established whether the observed probability that at least one parent is alert was greater (coordination) or lower (synchronisation) than that predicted under the null hypothesis of independent vigilance. We documented coordination of vigilance in common cranes (Grus grus) foraging in an area with high potential for disturbance by people. We documented synchronisation of vigilance in red-crowned cranes (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis)</b> in the less but not in the more disturbed area. Coordination in small flocks leads to high collective vigilance but low foraging rates that may not be suitable in areas with low disturbance. We also argue that synchronisation should break down in areas with high disturbance because periods with low vigilance are riskier. Results highlight the view that tempora...|$|R
40|$|We {{employed}} population viability analysis to estimate future population trends and extinction risk of Tancho, the Japanese or red-crowned crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis).</b> The stage matrix {{was based on}} 15 years of data collected by {{counting the number of}} wintering cranes and following the survivorship of banded cranes. The accidental death rate was estimated from the number of dead or seriously injured cranes collected in the Kushiro municipal zoo. Consequently, the accidental death rate was found to increase each year at 0. 072 % per year during the recent 14 years and 0. 132 % per year during final 6 years. The carrying capacity (K) was estimated from the mean mire area within the territory of a breeding pair and the geographic information system data in southeastern Hokkaido. Accordingly, K was estimated to be 1, 659 in this area. Using the stage matrix, accidental death rates and K (and 20 %-lower K), the simulation was conducted under three conditions: (1) the increase of accidental death, (2) the limitation of carrying capacity, and (3) the concurrent occurrence of carrying capacity limitation and accidental death increase. As a result, the extinction probability during 100 years was zero, although the accidental death rate increased at the current rate of 0. 132 % per year. Therefore, by artificial feeding in winter, the Japanese population of Tancho reached the adequate level, which seems sustainable unless some catastrophic factors seriously damage the population. To raise the tolerance to catastrophic factors, we discuss the probability of their distributional expansion to western or northern Hokkaido and even to Honshu...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{freshwater}} supplement scarcity {{and heavy}} human activities, the fresh water wetland ecosystem in Yellow River Delta is facing disintegrated deterioration, {{and it is}} seriously affecting {{the health of the}} Yellow River ecosystem. This paper identifies the restoration objectives of wetland aiming to protect ecological and economic values and development as well as the water resources of the Yellow River. The hydraulic and groundwater coupling model and Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System (LEDESS) of the Yellow River Delta were established to calculate environmental flows of degraded wetlands. LEDESS is a computer-based model developed and used to assess and evaluate the effects of land-use changes on nature. In this study, LEDESS is used to assess and evaluate the ecological effects and the restoration possibilities considering several environmental flows' supplement scenarios. This included the changes of suitable habitat conditions and its ecological carrying capacities for indicator species, e. g., Red-crowned crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis),</b> Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), and Saunder's gull (Larus relictus), and changing of ecological patterns. The results showed that replenishing fresh water to wetlands is one of the effective adaptive measures to mitigate wetland degradation and improve its habitat quality and carrying capacities. This study indicated that landscape ecology approach is not only considered as a good way to solve complex problems in ecosystem management but also can be used to decide on the environmental flows and assess its ecological effects in large-scale wetland rehabilitation. This integrated method could make environmental flows estimated and assessment more rational than the results of hydrologic methods. It could assist decision makers to "see" the ecological effects after water supplementing and so alleviate the contradictions between environmental flows and production water demands, and can facilitate the implementation of environmental flows in most countries with water resources shortage...|$|R
40|$|The coastal-zone wetland in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province is {{the largest}} winter habitat of the Red-crowned Crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>japonensis)</b> in the world. The {{essential}} research question addressed in this paper is: What is the carrying capacity for Red-crowned Cranes in this habitat? Since water is ample in the salt marsh, the two vital limiting factors for the crane habitat are food and shelter. In this study, based upon crane numbers and their distribution {{during the winter of}} 2004 - 2005, the authors adopt the “Neu technique” to analyze habitat selection of Red-crowned Cranes to 8 types of tidal flat environments in the Yancheng Nature Reserve. Applying the “heat quantity method”, we find corn feed distributed by the nature reserve staff cannot support survival of wild cranes. Subsequently, using the “gravimetric method”, with the crane utilization of each habitat as a weighting, we estimate that total food supply in the nature reserve is far greater than required by the crane population in one winter season. This indicates that food supply is not a determining factor for this particular habitat selection. Moreover, from analysis of food selectivity it is evident that the preferred food comprises vegetal paddy chaff and supplemental corn feed, with natural vegetation occupying only a small proportion of their total food consumption. The spatial distribution of cranes was between 0. 8 - 2. 5 individuals per km 2, so that an optimum habitat of 1000 km 2 may contain 800 - 2500 cranes. Observations from the present study show that preferred spatial location has shrunk in the past 10 years toward a core area surrounded by a buffer area (641 km 2 in all), so that potentially the entire nature reserve could support ~ 570 - 2000 cranes. In addition, some 500 cranes are contained within an artificial waterfowl lake. In total it appears that the carrying capacity of the Yancheng Nature Reserve is of order 2500 - 3000 cranes, and they prefer to roost in a coastal habitat of lower salinity where food supply is plentiful, and which is distant from human disturbance...|$|R
