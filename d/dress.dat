40|$|Abstract. Metal-bonded ball-headed {{diamond wheel}} with small {{diameter}} {{has been widely}} used in the ultra-precision grinding of optical parts, especially in the parts with complex surface. In-position precise <b>dressing</b> technique of ball-headed diamond wheel is the key technology to improve grinding precision. The effect of mechanical errors on the profile accuracy of wheel <b>dressing</b> were theoretically analyzed firstly. Afterwards a ball-headed diamond wheel <b>dressing</b> equipment based on electrical discharge principle has been designed and built. Orthogonal experiments {{have been carried out}} on the <b>dressing</b> equipment, and the <b>dressing</b> quality of wheels under different <b>dressing</b> electrical parameters were analyzed in terms of wheel profile accuracy and wheel surface micro-topography. The influence of <b>dressing</b> electrical parameters on the <b>dressing</b> quality were investigated and the best electrical parameter combination was obtained. Experimental result showed that the wheel profile accuracy can reach upward 0. 8 µm after <b>dressing,</b> and the protrusion heights of diamond grain were uniformity and the protrusion effect was better than without <b>dressing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The main {{objective}} of <b>dressing</b> wounds {{is to prevent}} wound infections. Successful wound management depends on {{an understanding of the}} healing process combined with knowledge of the properties of the various dressings available. Wounds can heal primarily, secondarily, or by delayed primary closure. The method of <b>dressing</b> includes occlusive and non-occlusive <b>dressing.</b> Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcome of non-occlusive versus occlusive dressings in postoperative sutured wounds. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study done on 298 patients over a period of one and half years from 1 st January 2012 to 30 th June 2013. All elective inpatients with sutured wounds in the Department of General Surgery requiring local wound care postoperatively were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of <b>dressing</b> used i. e., occlusive or non-occlusive. The results obtained were statistically analysed by student t-test and Chisquare test. Results: In our study, we found that wound infection and wound dehiscence were noted more in non-occlusive <b>dressing</b> group as compared to occlusive <b>dressing</b> group. We also found that mean cost of <b>dressing,</b> frequency of <b>dressing</b> changes, the pain during <b>dressing</b> change, mean duration of hospital stay for nonocclusive <b>dressing</b> was more than occlusive <b>dressing.</b> Conclusion: After a careful review of current study on wound management and type of <b>dressing,</b> it is evident that occlusive <b>dressing</b> had better clinical outcomes as compared to nonocclusive <b>dressing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} available {{indicates that}} <b>dressing</b> difficulties after stroke are common and persistent. Previous studies have documented <b>dressing</b> ability but none have investigated each individual {{component of the}} <b>dressing</b> process using a detailed <b>dressing</b> assessment suitable for stroke patients. The aims of this study were: to develop a <b>dressing</b> assessment (Nottingham Stroke <b>Dressing</b> Assessment) breaking <b>dressing</b> down into its component parts; to identify <b>dressing</b> problems; and to investigate the relationship between <b>dressing</b> ability and physical, perceptual and cognitive disabilities due to stroke. A series of 60 male and female stroke patients were assessed on their <b>dressing</b> abilities using the Nottingham Stroke <b>Dressing</b> Assessment on four occasions over their first 14 days after admission to the Nottingham Stroke Unit. During this time patients were also assessed on the Rivermead ADL scale, Rivermead Motor Function and other physical, perceptual and cognitive assessments. The frequency of problems in <b>dressing</b> were determined. The most difficult problems were pulling up trousers, putting shoe on affected foot and pulling up pants. The relation between <b>dressing</b> score and all other assessments was determined using a Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. There were statistically significant correlations between <b>dressing</b> and activities of daily living, gross motor function, leg and arm function, perception, sensation, language, hand-eye coordination and intelligence. No significant relation was found with apraxia, memory, premorbid IQ or reasoning ability. These results suggest that motor recovery and perceptual abilities are important determinants of <b>dressing</b> ability as has been suggested by previous studies.

After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer <b>dress.</b>|$|E
