50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of <b>induction</b> <b>logging</b> has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, <b>induction</b> <b>logging</b> is the only option available.|$|E

Four data sets at frequencies of 24, 90, 370, and 1000 Hz were obtained along a pair of monitoring boreholes located 80. 5 m apart. Travel-time information was first extracted from these EM data sets using a wavefield transform with a ray series ap-proximation.

The solution process uses a Krylov subspace iteration to solve the scattering equation, which is based on the modified iterative dissi-pative method. Internal consistency checks and compar-isons with mode matching and finite-difference solutions for vertical borehole models demonstrate the accuracy of the solution. There are no known analytical solutions for induc-tion log responses arising from deviated boreholes in-tersecting horizontal bed boundaries.

40|$|A trial {{airborne}} electromagnetic (AEM) {{geophysical survey}} {{was carried out}} across a 13 × 9 km area of the northern Nottinghamshire (UK) coalfield. One of the objectives {{was to examine the}} influence of coal mines (collieries) and associated spoil heaps situated above the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer. The conductivity models obtained from the AEM survey revealed extensive zones of enhanced subsurface conductivity in the vicinity of all the collieries in the survey area. The present study provides information regarding subsequent investigations (ground geophysics and borehole) to confirm the AEM results and to investigate the geochemical nature of the conductive zone identified in the vicinity of one of the collieries. Following ground geophysical confirmation of the airborne results, three boreholes were drilled into one of the conductive zones to the east of a working colliery. Geophysical logs and analysis of pore fluid geochemistry demonstrate that there is a very strong correlation between the borehole <b>induction</b> <b>logs</b> (formation conductivity), total dissolved solids (TDS) and chloride in the pore waters.

Porewater geochemistry obtained from core has been compared with that of local aquifer waters and with samples obtained from the colliery.

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>logging</b> is a {{well-developed}} geophysical method {{with multiple}} applications. It {{has been used}} extensively in academic research {{as well as in}} industry. <b>Induction</b> <b>logging</b> is a controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) exploration method. It characterizes geologic formations through the measurements of induced magnetics fields. The purpose of this research project is to better understand induction logs and the effects fractured geologic formations have on them. Computer modeling is used to generate synthetic logs for analysis in this research project. The original program required certain modifications to fit this research project?s goals. The computer program, Seatem is based on the finite element method. It is able to use a layered Earth model that is the basis for the synthetic log analysis. The geologic layers in this model are assigned various conductivities and also have the option of being assigned a geologic roughness value. The geologic roughness parameter is used to simulate fractured rocks in the subsurface. The synthetic logs generated by the modified Seatem program produce some encouraging results. In a thinning bed analysis, it is shown that as a conductive bed is thinned in a step-size procedure, the resulting induction log underestimates the actual conductivity of the layer. It also shows that the boundary layers around the thinned layer are better characterized in the log. The next synthetic log was calculated for a fractured resistive layer. This log shows that as the layer becomes more fractured, there is an increase in the underestimation of the actual conductivity. This layer is then thinned down and another synthetic log is calculated. The resulting log shows similar traits to the thinning bed analysis and shows an underestimation of the apparent conductivity. The same procedure is performed for a fractured conductive layer. The analysis produce similar results; however, that are much more drastic changes in the induction logs. As the unit becomes more fractured, the apparent conductivity is lower then the actual conductivity, as in the resistive case. However, smaller increases in the roughness parameter produced more severe underestimations than larger increases in the roughness parameter did for the resistive layer...|$|E
30|$|During the {{prediction}} process, {{the square of}} the quality factor, Q 2, was used to predict the deep <b>induction</b> <b>log</b> (ILD). The choice of Q 2 is based on the following explanation. Because {{the prediction}} algorithm makes use of the linear relationship between log property and attributes, if the cross plot shows nonlinearity, the algorithm tests for linear relationships using nonlinear transforms. For example, if the cross plot between a target log and an attribute resembles a curve, the algorithm will test different nonlinear transforms such as log, square, square root, etc., to see whether a linear relationship is created by any of the transforms. From these tests, the transform that creates the best linear relationship is chosen. In our case, Q 2 was found to provide the best linear relationship between ILD and Q (Fig.  12 c), suggesting that the relationship between ILD and Q is nonlinear. We therefore used Q 2 in the prediction process instead of Q. The interval having the highest resistivity (i.e., highest Q values) is the upper Eagle Ford (Fig.  12).|$|R

Using the SNMR method, the water content of the unsaturated and saturated zones (i. e. porosity of an aquifer) can be reliably determined. This information and resistivity data permit in-situ determination of other aquifer parameters. Comparison of the SNMR results with borehole data clearly shows that the water content determined by SNMR is the free or mobile water in the pores.
