5|$|Nevertheless, {{the rivalry}} is {{attributed}} to the bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, also seen between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening night}} of the {{convention}} saw the keynote speech by Governor Stassen; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie {{and became one of}} the candidate's floor managers. The second night featured a speech by the only living former president, Herbert Hoover, who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination. His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system. In the meantime, the Dewey campaign, faced with the German announcement that with France taken, Hitler's forces would sail on Britain, did <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> stem the flow of delegates to Willkie. Negotiations among Dewey, Taft, and Vandenberg came to nothing because none would accept less than the presidential nomination. A blaze of publicity followed Willkie wherever he went, as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters, including the entire Connecticut delegation. A strong minority of African Americans still supported the Republicans, and Willkie met with a group of them, urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941.|$|E

Yet, the government of Austria tried <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> be accommodating in some respects: The Reichsgesetzblatt, publishing the laws and ordinances of Cisleithania, was issued in eight languages; all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.|$|E

25|$|The Peckford {{administration}} {{worked to}} renegotiate the lopsided Upper Churchill contract with Quebec, however repeated attempts were unsuccessful. The {{federal government was}} unwilling to intervene, and in 1984 and 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled twice in Quebec's favour. Like his predecessor, Peckford hoped to develop the Lower Churchill hydro project, but his government was also unsuccessful in securing a transmission route through Quebec. His government sought for constitutional change so that the province would have greater control of the fisheries, but Peckford was unable to get enough support from other premiers. The government did <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> influence federal fisheries policies, but Ottawa still brought in controversial policies that Peckford felt were disastrous. His government also continued with policies that added to overcapacity in the fishery, such as allowing too many fish processing plants to operate.|$|E
