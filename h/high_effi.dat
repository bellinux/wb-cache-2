40|$|Introduction It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the problem}} of global warming will require a combination of solutions ranging from carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) through to improved carbon effi ciency of fossil fuels and (in the long term) widespread use of renewable energy sources. In particular, as energy costs increase, the advantage of <b>high</b> energy-conversion <b>effi</b> ciency becomes very important. In this respect, fuel cell (FC) systems (with signifi cantly higher conversion efficiency than other energy conversion devices, particularly at small sizes) will become more important and their market share will increase accordingly (further enhanced by reductions in manufacturing costs). However, for FCs overall to achieve <b>higher</b> <b>effi</b> ciency, the energy carrier for those FCs (mostly H 2) should also be produced at <b>higher</b> <b>effi</b> ciency. This can be achieved by using membrane reactors, devices that integrate separation and reaction in a single unit, thus reducing the amount of equipment required and circumventing certain thermodynamic limitations that affect conventional systems. In this chapter, the application of membrane reactors as innovative reformers for combined heat and power (CHP) systems will be discussed. An overview of actual CHP systems will be outlined fi rst, then {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} applying novel reformers will be highlighted, and fi nally an energy analysis of a micro-CHP system with conventional and membrane reformers will be presented...|$|R

To this purpose we applied under informed consent two XD cages to 150 Chilean chronic chagasic patients. The fecal samples (FS) of the triatomines at 30, 60 and 90 days post feeding were divided into two parts: in one a microscopic search for mobile trypomastigote and/or epimastigote forms was performed. In the other part, DNA extraction-purifi cation for PCR directed to the conserved region of kDNA minicircles of trypanosomes (PCR-XD), without previous microscopic observation was done. An XD was considered positive when at least one mobile T. cruzi parasite in any one of three periods of incubation was observed, whereas PCR-XD was considered positive when the 330 bp band specifi c for T. cruzi was detected. 25 of 26 cases with positive conventional XD were PCR-XD positive (concordance 96. 2 %), whereas 85 of 124 cases with negative conventional XD were positive by PCR-XD (68. 5 %). Human chromosome 12 detected by Real-time PCR used as exogenous internal control of PCR-XD reaction allowed to discounting of PCR inhibition and false negative in 40 cases with negative PCR-XD.

In this research field, halcogenide fi bres as host materials for rare earth ions can play a major part. Moreover, the fabrication of amplifying integrated optical structures is of great interest in the fi eld of modern telecommunication technologies or optical sensing. These optical components can be applied to compensate waveguide losses, coupling and splitting losses, as well as to fabricate integrated laser sources, operating in the telecom bands or middle IR. With high refractive index values and an appropriate rare-earth (RE) solubility, chalcogenide glasses exhibit high spontaneous emission probabilities and, consequently large emission cross-sections for radiative electronic transitions of RE 3 + ions.

In vitro activity of NPs is tested in hypopharynx squamous carcinoma (FaDu) cells and nonmalignant epithelial cells, demonstrating that the presence of additional α-TOS signifi cantly enhances its antiproliferative activity; however, a range of selective concentrations is observed. These NPs induce apoptosis of FaDu cells by activating the mitochondria death pathway (via caspase- 9).

CONCLUSION Based on these results, we can say that the combination of amlodipine and losartan – the fi rst fi xed combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker available in the pharmaceutical market, is an excellent option for the treatment {{of a wide range of}} hypertensive patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} HIV/AIDS disparity among African American {{women and}} women in other ethnic groups dictates the need to implement the most effective HIV prevention interventions. This study examined the impact of perceived group support on HIV protective behaviors (i. e., attitudes and behaviors related to condom use, alcohol, and drugs) of African American women participating in an HIV prevention intervention. Participants were 398 heterosexual, unmarried African American women older than 18 years who {{agreed to participate in}} Sisters Informing Sisters on Topics about AIDS, a widely used HIV prevention program for African American women. Regression analyses revealed that higher perceived support contributed to (1) <b>higher</b> condom negotiation <b>effi</b> cacy, (2) <b>higher</b> condom use efficacy, (3) consistent condom use for sex ually active participants, (4) higher perception of drug harmfulness, and (5) drug disapproval at posttest. These effects were found while controlling for pretest measures of condom and drug attitudes and use along with age...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{to balance}} environmental conditions in organic farming systems are strongly restricted as {{the input of}} nutrients is limited and no soluble fertilisers and synthetic pestizides are used. These systems require cultivars {{that are able to}} adapt to stressful, less controlled and therefore highly variable environments. This study sums up the results of winter wheat cultivars tested under marginal and fertile soil conditions on organic farms in Switzerland. Three were derived from organic, three from conventional breeding programs and two old cultivars. Across three marginal sites, there was a slight trend towards higher yields of the organically bred cultivars. This difference was statistically signifi cant at the lowest yielding site. However, no such trend could be observed at two fertile sites and across all fi ve sites. Cultivars suitable for organic farming should achieve high yields but moreover high baking quality and a <b>high</b> nutrient use <b>effi</b> ciency, which was in that study achieved by the organically bred cultivar Scaro...|$|R
