60|$|Well, it's {{a relief}} to be alone. But say, this is high up! And what a noise! What is it they're <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> away out in the air, with all that clatter--building a steel building, I guess. Well, those fellers have their nerve, all right. I'll sit further back from the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> {{although}} you have never said a word to me about it," [...] she continued, with an odd little note of passion in her tone. [...] "Don't let her persuade you to stop. Let them cut and burn and hew till there isn't room for a mouse to hide. You promise?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was not {{a subject}} they could discuss at dinner--consecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler. The agony of nerves Soames had been through, the relief he felt at her safety, {{softened}} his power to condemn what she had done, or resist {{what she was going}} to do; he waited in a relaxed stupor for her revelation. Life was a queer business. There he was at sixty-five and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty years in building up security--always something one couldn't get on terms with! In the pocket of his dinner-jacket was a letter from Annette. She was coming back in a fortnight. He knew nothing of what she had been <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> And he was glad that he did not. Her absence had been a relief. Out of sight was out of mind! And now she was coming back. Another worry! And the Bolderby Old Crome was gone--Dumetrius had got it--all because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts. He furtively remarked the strained look on his daughter's face, as if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldn't buy. He almost wished the war back. Worries didn't seem, then, quite so worrying. From the caress in her voice, the look on her face, he became certain that she wanted something from him, uncertain whether it would be wise of him to give it her. He pushed his savoury away uneaten, and even joined her in a cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blessed {{little bit}} of shell that found a {{temporary}} shelter in my arm!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "All the same, I feel just as you <b>do.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>there,</b> for all your graciousness, you were something sacred, something far away." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond grinned. [...] "Told {{her what}} you were going back for--and she didn't believe a word of it? As a matter of fact, you could hardly expect her to. Still, you needn't be unduly anxious. It wouldn't matter very much what you <b>did</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> She might be horrified when she heard of it, but she wouldn't let you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just look at it!" [...] he cried. [...] "An' it's all mine! It's free. I can {{lie down}} under them trees an' {{sleep for a}} thousan' years if I want to. Aw, come on, Mart, let's chuck it. What's the good of waitin' another moment. That's the land of nothin' to <b>do</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> an' I got a ticket for it--an' it ain't no return ticket, b'gosh!" ...|$|R
50|$|A heartbroken Jim wanders {{about and}} runs into Sylvia, who is wearing her best Sunday dress. He wonders what she's <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{this time of}} night, and she confesses her newfound {{feelings}} for him ("There's Always Me"). Despite the circumstances, Jim can't handle this revelation, and he rushes off.|$|E
5000|$|In the NFL, Belk {{proved to}} be a versatile, reliable, and very {{intelligent}} football player, starting at both defensive end and tackle. One of his coaches, Dick Nolan, made this testimony in reference to Belk, “What I like about Bill is that he’s very smart. He knows exactly what he’s <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and can adjust to any situation." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Jonas Rivera, the {{producer}} of Pixar's film Up, Dug's Special Mission [...] "is {{a little bit of}} the backstory of what Dug was actually <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on this mysterious mission when we meet him Up". In the short, Dug is instructed on how to catch the bird (Kevin) by Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, but their instructions are really intended to keep Dug away from them.|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD. Yes: {{he became}} a planter, and <b>did</b> well <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> Mr. Rankin. The history of that {{property}} is a very curious and interesting one--at least it is so to a lawyer like myself.|$|R
5000|$|Gurode later {{received}} 30 stitches {{just above}} and below his right eye. After the game, Titans head coach Jeff Fisher apologized {{on behalf of the}} Titans organization to Cowboys coach Bill Parcells. After the game, Haynesworth apologized, saying [...] "What I <b>did</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> was disgusting. It doesn't matter what the league does to me. The way I feel right now, you just can't describe it." [...] Gurode later said that he would not seek criminal charges against Haynesworth. He continued to experience headaches and blurred vision as of October 2006.|$|R
5000|$|I've {{been dreaming}} {{about this for}} about 12 minutes and that's not a lie. The theme song for this was Holy Grail by Hunters and Collectors and that's what we got. You can use every superlative in the English {{language}} to describe what Troy <b>did</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> tonight. He was just awesome.

5000|$|The use of [...] "Beatles" [...] as a {{nickname}} {{for the group}} elicited a response from English musician and former Beatle Ringo Starr, who expressed his disgust at {{the use of his}} former band's name in this context, saying: [...] "It’s bullshit. What they are <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> is against everything The Beatles stood for," [...] and adding that the Beatles had stood for peace and opposed violence.|$|E
5000|$|Sage and Iamsu! {{made their}} U.S. {{television}} debut performing [...] "Gas Pedal" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman on March 27, 2013. The performance garnered little {{response from the}} audience but Sage was a good sport about his performance during an interview he had with RapFix Live: [...] "But it was tight though, 'cause you {{could tell it was}} a real audience 'cause as soon as I was like, 'How y’all <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> tonight?' They said, 'Ahhhh,'" [...] Sage continued.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships, held in Valencia, Spain, Manou {{qualified}} for the final running an Australian record of 2-01.85 in her heat. In a tactical final, Manou broke away from perennial champion Maria de Lurdes Mutola and Ukrainian Tetiana Petlyuk to win {{the gold medal in}} a major upset. Manou was shocked herself saying: [...] "I was wondering what I was <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Then I realised that I could win the race. This is amazing. I still can't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be such a}} {{dear old}} stick," [...] Geraldine laughed. [...] "I want you to like him because I find him so interesting. You see, as he gets to know one a little better he doesn't seem to mind talking about the war. You others will {{scarcely}} say a word {{of what you have}} seen or of what is being <b>done</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I like to be told things by people who have actually seen them. He happened to be ten minutes early this evening and he gave me a most fascinating description of some skirmishing near La Bassee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Euphemia, {{looking out}} of a back window. [...] "What a lovely little iron balcony! <b>Do</b> you sit <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on warm evenings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That gang come {{to steal}} an' not to fight. Can't you see that? If they meant to fight they'd <b>do</b> it. They're <b>out</b> <b>there</b> arguin' about my hosses." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former Bulls {{head coach}} Scott Skiles cited Sefolosha's {{wingspan}} and past pro basketball experience as {{reasons why the}} Bulls were interested in him. [...] "Thabo's got great physical gifts that, frankly, {{a lot of guys}} in the league just don't have. He's got tremendous length and has really quick hands, he grabs your attention whenever you watch him play. It's easy to see that he knows what he's <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> You can tell he likes to play defense, too. He's eager to get after it." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{according}} to former and current Second Chance employees interviewed by the Albuquerque Journal, [...] "everything that happens there is based in Scientology." [...] Inmates and employees were required to go through courses and [...] "ethics training" [...] that were taken directly from Scientology; Scientology-related entities {{played a major role}} in operations at Second Chance; the program was predominately funded by wealthy Scientologist donors; and the program materials were taken directly from Narconon and Criminon, both run by Scientologists and classified by the IRS as [...] "scientology-related entities". Several employees told the Journal that the program was merely a [...] "front group" [...] for Scientology. The Mayor of Albuquerque, Martin Chavéz, commented: [...] "It was always represented to us that this program was totally secular, but that some of it was based on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings ... If in fact what they were <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> was teaching people directly out of L. Ron Hubbard's books, well, that just adds fuel to the fire." ...|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{the team}} had bonded during {{training}} camp last October in Honolulu when Lamar Odom hired a chef to cook for the team. [...] "I won't take the credit", Odom said, [...] "but in training camp we became tighter. I made sure we had a chef. We ate dinner, lunch and breakfast together every day at training camp. I think that was special. I think that's when the bond started." [...] Additionally, Byrant's behavior towards his teammates changed as well. [...] "It's the little things, taking guys out to dinner, talking to guys more about things", Luke Walton said. [...] "He's such a great player, I think sometimes it gets frustrating if we don't understand something. But he's {{taking the time to}} explain what guys are <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> a little more. I think before he used {{to be a little more}} negative towards his teammates, as opposed to now, when he's pulling people to the side, talking to them, finding out ways to figure it out together instead of just coming down hard on them. He's definitely more patient. He's having more fun. I think he's enjoying it more, especially with the team going like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winifred, [...] "if {{they were}} in London, perhaps; in London it's amusing to <b>do</b> nothing. But <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> of course, he'll simply get bored to death." ...|$|R
5000|$|With his two careers each {{taking up}} more time, {{he decided that}} the {{creative}} one was the more fulfilling. In an interview he said, [...] "Everything I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{in the world was}} being prevented simply because I had this job. And it was a job that I didn't really enjoy in the first place." [...] Noting however, [...] "There are things I still very much believe in about the legal profession, and it has undeniably made me a smarter, better organized, savvier person, but there is this lack of focus and epidemic of bad management in the legal industry that makes it unbearable to people who, like me, can visualize and see things beyond a paycheck and a secure lifestyle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. <b>Do</b> you know, <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{just now}} I felt--. When I heard that these {{aeroplanes}} were a stage nearer. I {{felt as if}} I were fighting the machinery of fate." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Wambach was {{selected}} second {{during the first}} round of the 2002 WUSA Draft by the Washington Freedom for the second season of the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA). [...] After tying with the Carolina Courage for last place during the previous season, the Freedom hoped to turn things around in 2002. With Mia Hamm out for the first half of the season for knee surgery and recovery, the Freedom found themselves in sixth place. After Hamm's return, the team finished the remainder of the season 9-1-2, finishing third with a berth into the playoffs. Of the team's turnaround, Wambach noted, [...] "Early on in the season it was difficult to get everyone on the same page. Mia was out, we had just started playing with the Chinese players, Steffi hadn't come yet. There were so many factors that went into us not playing as well. Since people have returned, and we have been able to grasp what exactly one another was <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> it's been easier to get results." [...] During the semifinals, the Freedom upset the Philadelphia Charge 1-0. [...] During the final against the Carolina Courage, the Freedom lost in front of 12,000 spectators at Herndon Stadium in Atlanta. Wambach assisted on Hamm's 64th-minute goal, the team's second goal, after the Courage's Danielle Fotopoulos scored an own goal in the 31st minute; however, it was not enough to equalize Carolina's three goals. After leading all first-year players in the league in scoring, Wambach was named WUSA Rookie of the Year in 2002. She was Washington's leading scorer with ten goals and ten assists and finished tied for fourth for scoring in the WUSA.|$|E
40|$|Spring is coming, MCMLA! Take a {{break from}} our unseasonable weather with the Winter issue of the Express! This month we {{highlight}} new members (there {{are quite a few}} good people joining us!) and old. We’d like to say howdy to Kristen DeSanto, Barbara Harvey, Monica Rogers, Jim Chestnut, Peggy Cruse, and Robin Nielsen. Please make them welcome if you happen to meet. We bid farewell to Angie Arner, retiring after 40 years, and say a sad goodbye to Pat Auflick, who died this past November after a short illness. Our intrepid leader, Betsy Mueth, ruminates on whether or not librarians have stress. (Is this even a question?) See if you recognize yourself in her humorous selfdescription. Darell Schmick returns with Darell’s Doozies, to once again quiz your knowledge of arcane medical library facts. And Peggy Mullaly-Quijas is reminding all of us to renew our MCMLA membership for 2012. You can do it online!

5000|$|Ormond was {{involved}} in a notable piece of sledging; when, in a Test match against Australia in 2001, Mark Waugh asked him, [...] "Mate, what are you <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? <b>There's</b> no way you're good enough to play for England." [...] Ormond replied [...] "Maybe not, but at least I'm the best player in my own family", a reference to Waugh's brother Steve, who was the captain of the Australian team.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to Reuben himself, I must own there's a {{good deal}} of force in what he says; and that until those Thornes have been sent out of the country, his story might follow him. And I have no doubt he would <b>do</b> well <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> He is a good workman for his age and, as he says, can turn his hand to almost anything. Labour is scarce <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and, as he has got his head screwed on the right way, I have no doubt that he will fall on his feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|Some day these shopmen will goad me too far.

Some people say as how he's crazy over scalp-huntin'; but I reckon that's not so. I've seen him a few times. He don't hang round the {{settlement}} 'cept when the Injuns are up, an' nobody sees him much. At home he sets round silent-like, an' then mebbe next mornin' he'll be gone, an' won't show up fer days or weeks. But all the frontier knows of his deeds. Fer instance, I've hearn of settlers gettin' up in the mornin' an' findin' a couple of dead and scalped Injuns {{right in front of}} their cabins. No one knowed who killed 'em, but everybody says 'Wetzel.' He's allus warnin' the settlers when they need to flee to the fort, and sure he's right every time, because when these men go back to their cabins they find nothin' but ashes.

I think Kevin should just like maybe just go away with 19 winssicand just call it a record {{and that would be the}} end of it. We work really, really hard at what we do, all of us do in our craft.
