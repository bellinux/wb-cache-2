500|$|Garfield did not {{consider}} Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. [...] "He {{will probably be the}} man, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do better." [...] The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advertisement}} {{begins with}} {{three young men}} standing outside a fruit shop or cornershop. One of them takes a sip out of a can of Tango he is holding. The voice-over of [...] "commentators" [...] Ralph and Tony (voiced by Hugh Dennis and Ray Wilkins) appear. Ralph says [...] "oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use a video replay here" [...] and the footage of the man drinking the Tango is [...] "rewound" [...] (with the visual effect of a tape recorded being rewound on screen) to some ten seconds before he drinks the Tango, for a [...] "replay". Then, a man painted completely orange (Peter Geeves) comes onto the scene, who runs around the men and then taps the Tango drinker on the back.|$|E
2500|$|Intelligence reports {{indicate}} that United States president Bill Clinton and his cabinet were aware before {{the height of the}} massacre that a [...] "final solution to eliminate all Tutsis" [...] was planned. However, fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped US policy at the time, with many commentators identifying the graphic consequences of the Battle of Mogadishu as the key reason behind the US's failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the Rwandan Genocide. After the battle, the bodies of several US casualties of the conflict were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by crowds of local civilians and members of Aidid's Somali National Alliance. According to the US's former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: [...] "The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again." [...] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying [...] "I don't think we could have ended the violence, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have cut it down. And I regret it." [...] Eighty percent of the discussion in Washington concerned the evacuation of American citizens.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{would be}} so easy too," [...] {{continued}} Heika, [...] "to have some method of letting him know what <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only agree about the signs or signals beforehand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} an {{excellent}} plan, Doctor; but if the boats were stopped and they found the sick, they would kill them to a certainty. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> leave them. <b>I</b> am quite sure Miss Hannay would not leave her uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, by golly, there's a {{woman with}} savvy! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> more or less stand a {{highball}} if it wasn't too long a one--not over a foot tall!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Louise; [...] "we all would. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{turn out}} a very creditable paper--for Millville. But wouldn't it {{cost a lot}} of money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{no reason}} it should not. Delicate {{children}} often have it the most lightly. But I am sorry for Gillian, though, if she would let us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make her happy.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well, well; that's {{the same}} thing. It was Givantake, {{though of course}} he isn't going to sign his name to everything.

6000|$|... "Yes;--and {{ready to}} spend any money {{you like to}} name. Let me see. Loughton is grouped with Smotherem, and Walker is a deal too strong at Smotherem to hear of any other claim. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> dare to propose it.

6000|$|... "Of Peter! You {{surprise}} me, Benjamin. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not be {{in better}} hands, since we have got this risk to run with the savages. If it was Pigeonswing that you feared, I could understand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Margaret; [...] "as all her elders {{thought it}} right, <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> advise her to refuse absolutely. Besides, {{it was a}} promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Rollo; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{probable}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{see people}} going up or coming down, {{if there were}} any there now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will do our best, Colonel, in any {{direction}} you may point out; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> defend a breach against any reasonable force brought against it.

6000|$|... "It's {{too dark}} to see a thing," [...] {{announced}} Tom, after he and Sam had mounted {{to the top of a}} tall tree. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get a fine view from here in the daytime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied; [...] "I can't do that. For one thing, {{it would}} be too late when we got to Victoria, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get an {{engagement}} if we reached Vancouver in time to get to Kamloops by--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't, Boardman," [...] pleaded Dan. [...] "Boardy, I {{believe if}} I {{could get in}} and {{up to my room}} without anybody's seeing me, I'd let you tell them. There don't seem to be anybody about, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> manage it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so, sir," [...] Tom said; [...] "we {{have had}} {{very little to do}} during the six months we have been out here except to learn the {{language}} of the country, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> now <b>we</b> <b>could</b> pass very well as Spanish boys. Besides, who would suspect boys? We are quite ready to chance detection if we can be allowed to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very good, {{as far as}} it goes," [...] Francis replied, [...] "but {{it might}} have been a great deal better. If it hadn't been for the storm, we might have picked them all up one by one. Each vessel we took, the {{stronger}} we became, and I had calculated upon our capturing the greater number. But in such a sea, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> possibly capture more than we did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "so should <b>I.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{get near}} enough {{actually}} to look down, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get {{near enough to}} see the water where it begins to take the plunge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} about one thing, Merwell," [...] he said. [...] "That mine is now teetotally lost--the claim was shifted by the landslide. If we could {{relocate}} the mine <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make our claim to it good at the land office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; he is bookish {{without being}} quick. I don't expect {{he will be}} of much use just yet, but he is as steady as old Time; and though he and Lance would neither of them do alone, yet {{together}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get on.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{have managed}} without," [...] said Mrs. Hollis, [...] "but {{to be sure}} it is as well {{to be on the safe}} side; though I'd rather be without the money than be at all the trouble and hurry this work will be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe you}} could have {{overtaken}} them if all of us had been close at your heels," [...] replied George, speaking with considerable difficulty because of the shortness of his breath. [...] "But, {{as a matter of}} fact, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have followed those men even if the team itself had been ours only in consideration of our catching them. You see, we have run a mile at full speed, and we're about used up." ...|$|R

If he chooses to remain an Englishman he can't take the title. If he chooses to take the title he must be an Italian, then he'll have nothing to live on. My belief is we shan't see him any more. I wish it had been Crocker with all my heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Bono {{said of the}} song, [...] "It {{would be}} stupid to start drawing up battle lines, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the fact that 'New Year's Day' made the Top Ten {{indicated}} a disillusionment among record buyers. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> 'New Year's Day' was a pop single, certainly {{not in the way}} that Mickie Most might define a pop single as something that lasts three minutes and three weeks in the chart. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have written that kind of song." ...|$|R
