5|$|On June 2, 1864, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry (plus {{additional}} cavalry and infantry regiments) marched from Charleston towards White Sulphur Springs {{in eastern}} West Virginia. The men were poorly equipped, and over {{one third of}} the cavalry did not have horses. Their immediate <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> Stanton, Virginia. On June 7, they met two groups of infantry, and one division of cavalry, under the commands of Generals David Hunter and George Crook. Fresh supplies were issued at that time.|$|E

40|$|The <b>destination</b> <b>is</b> {{the focal}} point of tourism {{marketing}} activities. Many definitions of <b>destinations</b> have <b>been</b> proposed in the past, but it remains unclear what a <b>destination</b> <b>is</b> from a consumer perspective at early stages of the destination choice process. Yet, it is the consumer perspective that matters most. The present study investigates consumer perceptions of what a <b>destination</b> <b>is.</b> Results indicate that (1) consumers have a very broad position on what a <b>destination</b> <b>is,</b> (2) the distance between the destination and home affects the size of the geographical area perceived as destination, and (3) geographically larger <b>destinations</b> <b>are</b> severely underresearched. Findings have implications for both tourism research and tourism marketing, indicating that <b>destinations</b> need to <b>be</b> marketed differently to long-haul tourists...|$|R

The ship was declared a prize of war on 10 December 1940, valued at £144,000. She departed on 5 January 1941 to join Convoy OB 270, which had departed from Liverpool that day and dispersed at sea on 8 January. She sailed to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, arriving on 17 January.

5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> unclear {{due to the}} SEC {{championship}} game, which {{determined the}} conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 1864, Lieutenant Colonel Dove resigned. He never {{recovered}} from his foot wound received in 1863 near Lewisburg, {{and died in}} 1868. Major Hoffman was {{in command of the}} regiment during Dove's absence (and after Powell's promotion to brigade commander), and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel effective July 14, 1864. On July 8, the regiment left Charleston, West Virginia, for Parkersburg—arriving on July 12. They boarded the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad with their horses on July 16, and began a three-day trip {{to the other side of}} the state. Their <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> the rail station at Martinsburg. They were part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of West Virginia. The Army was commanded by General Hunter.

5|$|On March 8, 1846, after a final {{attempt to}} {{pressure}} Mexico {{to settle on}} a boundary for Texas, Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor to move his army, which included May's dragoon squadron, to the Rio Grande. Taylor's <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> the river's north bank, directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros, which stood at a natural choke-point and controlled access to well-traveled routes to the south. When Taylor refused to leave the region, Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25, 1846, which officially commenced hostilities. On May 8, 1846, the two main forces met at the Battle of Palo Alto, where May's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge.|$|E

In response to Beebe's dismissal, Horsfall retorted that he had been ill-treated by Beebe from the beginning of the expedition, and that his subsequent actions had been for the express purpose of revenge. Continuing without Horsfall, Beebe and Blair traveled to Batavia in Java, to the island of Madura just to the north, and to Belitung between Borneo and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he expected at the season's start. Despite that sentiment, most fans and supporters pointed {{to the fact that}} in all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late in the fourth quarter and {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E

5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> Nome, on {{the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
5|$|Much of Galveston's {{success as}} a tourist <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> the result of E. Sid Holliday, who became the {{publicity}} and convention director of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce in 1925 and later became its head. The Chamber helped promote the legitimate face of Galveston's tourism and business community (though it cooperated heavily with the criminal enterprises). Legitimate amusements such as an amusement park that included a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster (the Mountain Speedway), {{in addition to the}} beaches and up-scale shopping districts (notably the Strand) drew visitors, including those less interested in the city's illegal attractions. One of the most spectacular efforts by the Chamber, though not one of the city's greatest successes, was the Pleasure Pier (originally known as the Brantly Harris Recreational Pier). This huge pier (later converted to the Flagship Hotel), built in the 1940s and used by the military {{until the end of the}} war, featured restaurants, rides, and an amphitheater.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July, {{when the}} British judged the tide high {{enough for the}} French ships to cross the sandbar, d'Estaing sailed instead from his {{position}} outside New York harbour.

The British fleet in New York, eight ships of the line {{under the command of}} Lord Richard Howe, sailed out after him once they discovered his <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> Newport. D'Estaing arrived off Point Judith on 29 July, and immediately met with Major Generals Nathanael Greene and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, to develop a plan of attack. Major General John Sullivan's proposal was that the Americans would cross over to Aquidneck Island's (Rhode Island) eastern shore from Tiverton, while French troops using Conanicut Island as a staging ground, would cross from the west, cutting off a detachment of British soldiers at Butts Hill on {{the northern part of the}} island.

5|$|The Allies {{soon began}} {{detecting}} signs of preparations {{for a new}} convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted {{a message from the}} Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The French had {{embarked}} on a complex land and naval campaign in the Mediterranean, with the ultimate aim of launching an invasion and occupation of Egypt. The British were aware that the French had amassed a large army, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte, but their <b>destination</b> <b>was</b> unknown. Rendezvousing with Troubridge's squadron on 7 June, Nelson now had a sufficient force to engage the French, and began to comb the Mediterranean. The search lasted nearly two months, with the British force tracking westwards, and then back east, sometimes missing the French force by days. The French force, after invading and capturing Malta, arrived off Alexandria on 1 July and began landing troops. It was not until 25 July that news reached Nelson, by then at anchor off Sicily, that the French fleet had appeared off Egypt. He took his fleet to sea, and arrived off Alexandria on 1 August, but found the harbour empty. Heading east, he discovered the French fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, four frigates {{and a number of}} gunboats, at anchor in Abu Qir Bay.|$|E
