30|$|INSPIRE is a {{proposed}} European Directive {{that aims to}} create the legal framework for making relevant, standardized and quality assured <b>spatial</b> data available <b>for</b> the Member States of the European Union (EU) [6]. INSPIRE {{is based on the}} <b>infrastructures</b> <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> that are created by the Member States and that are made compatible with common implementing rules. For each Member State it is necessary to establish a search and distributions system based on network services and portals to make access to spatial data easier and to improve compatibility and interoperability, as well as it is necessary to develop agreements on access to and use of spatial data. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has developed a prototype EU Geoportal that is an entry point to the discovery and viewing of spatial data sets and services [7]. The implementation of a prototype EU geoportal helps to better understand user requirements and identify potential problems, and to define the standards-based technical specifications of the actual implementation of INSPIRE.|$|R
40|$|To obtain indoor {{positioning}} by using GPS (GNSS) satellite is difficult now. Additionally {{it is difficult}} to obtain high accuracy outdoor position when GPS receiver cannot find four or more GPS satellites in the viewing field of sky. The Japanese Government executed a new law NSDI (National <b>Spatial</b> Data <b>Infrastructure)</b> <b>for</b> a <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> society on May 30, 2007. In this law, everybody can know positional information in real time, anytime and anywhere. In addition, it is necessary to use satellite positioning for realization of seamless positioning, and to promote ubiquitous network technology. Realization of advanced geospatial information society will achieve by creating condition which can obtain positional information anytime and anywhere. However, those technologies have not been established yet. Our laboratory conducted seamless positioning experiment to verify whether it can obtain position seamlessly by using VRS-GPS (Virtual Reference System-GPS),QZSS(LEX signal) and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) for realizing an advanced <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> society. Especially, QZSS was launched in 2010 by JAXA and is satellite system taken by a combination of multi orbit plane and each satellite deployed to appear constantly 1 satellite near the zenit...|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{there has}} been a {{proliferation}} of geoportals for sharing of geographic information based on region or theme. Examples include the INSPIRE, or <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>Information</b> in the European Community geoportal, the NatCarb geoportal, which provides geographic information concerning carbon sequestration in the United States, and UNSDI, the United Nations Spatial Data Infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the European Union (EU) <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>Information</b> in the European Community (INSPIRE) initiative indicates {{this is a matter}} that is gaining more awareness at the national and EU scale. This states {{that there is a need}} to create ‘quality geo-referenced information’ that would be useful for a better understanding of human activities on environmental processes. Therefore, it is an ambitious project that aims to develop a European spatial information database.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} Spatial Data Infrastructures has grown {{steadily}} {{since the early}} 1990s, aided in part by interoperability standards maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Significant recent efforts to link and coordinate SDI's include <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>Information</b> in Europe (INSPIRE) and the UNSDI Initiative of the UN Geographic Information Working Group (UNIGWG). Between 1998 and 2001, the NASA-chaired Interagency Digital Earth Working Group (IDEW) contributed to this growth with a particular focus on interoperability issues, giving rise to the Web Map Service standard among others.|$|E
40|$|The GIIDA project aims {{to develop}} a digital <b>infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> the <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> within CNR. It is {{foreseen}} to use semantic-oriented technologies to ease information modeling and connecting, according to international standards like the ISO/IEC 11179. Complex information management systems, like GIIDA, will take benefit {{from the use of}} terminological tools like thesauri that make available a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information. Within GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based software, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented to allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This service is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other systems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating {{to develop a}} comprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined integrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is available in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be done in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full search allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it and as well as allows to filter the results by themes. Within a collaborative initiative with the CNR-Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology (IMATI) a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) version of EARTh was developed. This will ensure the possibility to support the use of the thesaurus {{within the framework of the}} Semantic Web in order to be used in decentralized metadata application...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{division of}} official <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> registers among several administrative bodies which manage them disables their quality and timely insight in spatial state. The establishment of modern automatic valuation systems enables more effective spatial management. In order for these systems to work, certain conditions {{have to be}} met. <b>Spatial</b> <b>information</b> is complex information which needs to be carefully modelled and by managing them in a digital form greater interoperability will be enabled. That enables the production of subsystems which use the information of the existing registers. In that way the system of mass real estate valuation {{would be based on}} official information of space information registers managed on national level. That would, with the help of familiar and clear methodology, through calculation transparency guarantee the justice of values determined by the system. The unambiguousness and adaptability of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> towards the systems of automatic management and information processing is best reached by application of certain norms. The infrastructure of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> prescribes those norms and gives guidelines for the development and improvement of <b>spatial</b> <b>information.</b> The infrastructure of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> in Croatia is supported by and prescribed through several laws, and all of them are in accordance with European directive <b>for</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> ??? INSPIRE. INSPIRE, among other things, has the goal to enable the exchange of information among different subjects and enable free combining of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> from different sources in whole Europe. The paper describes the combination of various sorts and sets of information of transport network which will, according to INSPIRE, be made within the national infrastructure of <b>spatial</b> <b>information,</b> and which will be used as factors of real estate valuation...|$|R

The coordinated access to data will retain the capacity to link directly data providers and the service providers because {{it is based on}} the principles of SEIS and INSPIRE. The implementation of INSPIRE is embedded in the synergies and meta-data standards that are used in GISC. Data and information will aim to be managed as close as possible to its source in order to achieve a distributed system, by involving countries and existing capacities that maintain and operate the required observation infrastructure.|$|E
30|$|Land Administration {{is a broad}} topic {{with many}} {{applications}} which provide a basic infrastructure for implementing land related policies and land management strategies to ensure social equity, economic growth and environmental protection [25]. The European Union acknowledging that LA can contribute to sustainable development and thus environmental policy promoted the <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>Information</b> in the European Community Directive (2007 / 2 /EC). The Directive sets the legal framework {{for the establishment of}} the <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>Information</b> in the European Community [26]. A main task of the INSPIRE programme is to enable interoperability and, when feasible, harmonisation of spatial data sets and services within Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{interoperation}} of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> is {{an effective}} way <b>for</b> sharing <b>spatial</b> <b>information,</b> in order to complete any exchanges and integrations of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> within and between application systems and organizations. This paper is to apply the metadata interoperability-related research outputs, namely Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), {{in the field of}} Digital library to the GIS research field. Then, the technical framework of this metadata interoperation under this protocol has been utilized to the spatial metadata interoperation, which provides a new means to transmitting, sharing, distributing and interoperating <b>spatial</b> <b>information,</b> and as well gives a new usable solution to the promotion and application of this protocol in the field of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> science. Furthermore, the relationship of all structured models, functioning descriptions and alternant modes of the prototype of the metadata interoperation <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> are also given in this paper.

30|$|Talking about {{harmonization}} {{of geographic}} {{data in the}} European Union, the INSPIRE directive (EC [4]) has to be mentioned. INSPIRE establishes an <b>infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> in European Union; addressing 34 spatial data themes needed for environmental applications, including transportation. As the spatial infrastructure needs a unified data model for each particular data theme, data from different European countries have to be harmonized into INSPIRE data schemes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Peer-to-peer {{overlays}} for Networked Virtual Envi-ronments {{have recently}} gained much research interest, {{resulting in a}} variety of different approaches <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> dissemination. Although designed for the same purpose, the eval-uation methodologies used by particular authors differ widely. This makes any comparison of existing systems difficult, if not impossible. To overcome this problem we present a benchmarking methodology which allows for a fair comparison of those systems. We, therefore, define a common set of workloads and metrics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by testing four typical systems <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> dissemination and discovering their specific performance profiles...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, since for {{our purpose}} {{we had to}} account also <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information,</b> we chose to use the SWLD {{approach}} [35] that, as <b>for</b> the <b>spatial</b> LBP, splits the image into sub-regions and computes an histogram for each of them. Finally, the histograms are concatenated in an ordered fashion.|$|R
40|$|The demand <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> {{systems has}} been growing sharply in recent years. Unfortunately, {{the current state of}} {{mainstream}} database technology has not facilitated the development of <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> systems that are as effective, efficient and usable as, e. g., management information systems. Attempts to overcome the limitations that underlie this relative lack of support have tended to be accompanied by problems with the productivity of application development and with the runtime performance of the modified system. This paper describes the integration of a spatial data handling component with the ROCK & ROLL deductive object-oriented database system. The extended ROCK & ROLL system provides much more comprehensive and better integrated database programming facilities than other candidate platforms <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> systems.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{on potential}} improvements to reason-ing approaches designed <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> in OWL. First, we introduce CHOROS, a qualitative <b>spatial</b> reasoning engine <b>for</b> ontologies in OWL. Building upon PelletSpatial [1], CHOROS supports consistency checking and query answering <b>for</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>information</b> using Region-Connection Calculus (RCC), but also using the Cone-Shaped Directional (CSD) logic formalism. It works with all RCC and CSD relations {{in combination with}} standard RDF/OWL semantic relations in an OWL ontology and can answer SPARQL queries with spatial and non-spatial relations. We also present SOWL, a <b>spatial</b> reasoner <b>for</b> both relation calculi implemented in SWRL and runs under Pellet [2]. We discuss and evaluate possible optimizations of CHOROS and compare its performance with that of SOWL. The experimental results demonstrate that CHOROS runs significantly faster than its respective SWRL implementation in most cases. I...|$|R
