25|$|After the {{printing}} press was invented in the mid 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg and others, the art of book printing soon spread {{to other parts of}} Europe. By the end of the 15th century, Venice had become a major centre of printing. In 1493, Đurađ Crnojević, the ruler of the Principality of Zeta (in present-day Montenegro), sent hieromonk Makarije to Venice to buy a press and learn how to print books. In 1494, Makarije printed the Cetinje Octoechos at Zeta's capital, Cetinje. It was the first <b>incunable</b> written in the Serbian recension of Church Slavonic. The Crnojević printing house worked until 1496, when Zeta fell to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|In early 1954, the Pierpont Morgan Library (now the Morgan Library & Museum) {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} {{a copy of the}} Missale Speciale, or the Constance Missal, a rare undated <b>incunable</b> printed from the same type used in the 1457 Psalter printed by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, but seemingly in a more primitive and unfinished state. The Morgan Library and many bibliographers believed the Missale Speciale pre-dated the Gutenberg Bible and was the first European book printed using movable type. The Morgan had purchased the book from the famous rare book dealer Hans P. Kraus, paying him $58,000 in cash and trading four extremely rare books, including two incunables printed by William Caxton. Hearing of the Morgan's acquisition, Stevenson began an analysis of its watermarks, and initial work quickly led him to conclude that the paper dated from the 1470s. In 1960, as Stevenson learned that two German bibliographers were reaching the same conclusion, he announced his discovery. In 1962, he published two articles on the Missale Speciale and in 1966 he published his full length study on it, The Problem of the Missale Speciale.|$|E

2500|$|Allan Henry Stevenson (June 20, 1903– March 31, 1970) was an American {{bibliographer}} {{specializing in}} the study of handmade paper and watermarks who [...] "single-handedly created a new field: the bibliographical analysis of paper." [...] Through his pioneering studies of watermarks, Stevenson solved [...] "the most fascinating, and perhaps the most notorious, bibliographical problem of our time," [...] the dating of the Missale Speciale or Constance Missal, an undated <b>incunable</b> (book printed before 1501) believed by many to pre-date the Gutenberg Bible (c. 1455), and possibly to have been the first printed European book. Stevenson proved that the book in fact had been printed nearly twenty years later, in 1473. Through similar analysis of watermarks, he also established that most block books, [...] small religious books in which the text and images were printed from a single woodcut block and which many believed dated from the early 15th century, had in fact been printed after 1460.|$|E
50|$|The ISTC {{was created}} to {{establish}} a system of <b>incunable</b> cataloging that was simple enough to be expanded quickly, bringing the goal of a complete <b>incunable</b> catalog back into focus.

50|$|Previous {{efforts to}} {{comprehensively}} catalog 15th century printing include Georg Wolfgang Panzers Annales Typographici ab Artis Inventae Origine ad Annum MD (1793-97) and Ludwig Hains Repertorium Bibliographicum (1822). Hains work was later supplemented by Copingers Supplement and Reichlings Appendices, which would {{pave the way}} for the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (1925). The Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (GW) was the most comprehensive catalog of <b>incunables</b> to date (and still offers more in-depth information than ISTC), but in recent decades work on the catalog has slowed {{to such a degree that}} the goal of cataloging all extant <b>incunables</b> under the GWs system is indefinitely far-off.|$|R
