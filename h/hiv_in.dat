40|$|Abstract. Objectives: To {{describe}} trends <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> notifications and <b>in</b> {{other measures}} of <b>HIV</b> incidence <b>in</b> homosexual men in developed countries. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed. In addition to the peer-reviewed literature, data on HIV surveillance trends were sought by searching websites of surveillance authorities in developed countries. Results: The availability of long-term HIV surveillance data varied considerably. However, in almost all jurisdictions in which such data were available, notifications of new HIV diagnoses among homosexual men have increased, mostly since the late 1990 s. The magnitude of this increase varied, but was more than 50 % in many countries. There were much fewer data available on trends in direct measures of <b>HIV</b> incidence <b>in</b> homosexual men, and increases <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> testing rates {{may have contributed to}} the increases <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> diagnoses <b>in</b> many countries. However, since the late 1990 s, several clinic- and community-based cohort studies in Europe and North America reported increasing incidence. Conclusion: There were increases <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> notifications <b>in</b> homosexual men in almost all developed countries, starting in the late 1990 s and continuing to 2006. Although increases <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> testing probably contributed to the increases in some settings, limited cohort data do support the existence of a true increase <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> incidence <b>in</b> European and North American countries. Improved monitoring of <b>HIV</b> incidence <b>in</b> homosexual men at the population level is required to allow more timely assessment of the drivers underlying such trends...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of <b>HIV</b> DNA-bearing cells <b>in</b> {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) is challenging because few cells are present. We present a novel {{application of the}} sensitive droplet digital (dd) PCR in this context. We analyzed CSF cell pellets and paired {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from 28 subjects, 19 of whom had undetectable HIV RNA (< 48 copies/mL) in both compartments. We extracted DNA from PBMC using silica-based columns and used direct lysis on CSF cells. HIV DNA and the host housekeeping gene (RPP 30) were measured in CSF and PBMC by (dd) PCR. We compared <b>HIV</b> DNA levels <b>in</b> virally-suppressed and-unsuppressed subgroups and calculated correlations between HIV DNA and RNA levels in both compartments using non-parametric tests. HIV DNA was detected in 18 / 28 (64 %) CSF cell pellets, including 10 / 19 (53 %) samples with undetectable HIV RNA. <b>HIV</b> DNA levels <b>in</b> CSF cell pellets were not correlated with RPP 30 (p = 0. 3), but correlated positively with <b>HIV</b> RNA <b>in</b> CSF (p = 0. 04) and <b>HIV</b> DNA <b>in</b> PBMC (p = 0. 03). Cellular <b>HIV</b> DNA <b>in</b> CSF was detected in comparable levels <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> RNA-suppressed and unsuppressed subjects (p = 0. 14). <b>In</b> contrast, <b>HIV</b> DNA levels <b>in</b> PBMC were significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> RNA-suppressed than <b>in</b> unsuppressed subjects (p = 0. 014). Among subjects with detectable <b>HIV</b> DNA <b>in</b> both compartments, <b>HIV</b> DNA levels <b>in</b> CSF were significantly higher than in PBMC (p< 0. 001). Despite low mononuclear cell numbers <b>in</b> CSF, <b>HIV</b> DNA was detected in most virally suppressed individuals. In contrast to PBMC, suppressive ART was not associated with lower <b>HIV</b> DNA levels <b>in</b> CSF cells, compared to no ART, perhaps due to poorer ART penetration, slower decay of HIV DNA, or enrichment of HIV DNA-bearing mononuclear cells into the CSF, compared to blood. Future studies should determine what fraction of HIV DNA is replication-competent in CSF leukocytes, compared to PBMC...|$|R
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to <b>HIV</b> <b>in</b> an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recently the Department of Health {{announced}} the introduction in England of voluntary universal <b>HIV</b> screening <b>in</b> early pregnancy to prevent vertical transmission. New data {{have shown the}} importance of <b>HIV</b> infection <b>in</b> infants born to mothers who were HIV-negative in early pregnancy and who acquired <b>HIV</b> later <b>in</b> pregnancy or during lactation. This requires consideration of repeat testing in late pregnancy and testing of partners of pregnant women (expanded antenatal HIV testing). Objective: To estimate cost effectiveness of expanded antenatal <b>HIV</b> testing <b>in</b> London (England) {{within the framework of}} universal voluntary <b>HIV</b> screening <b>in</b> early pregnancy. Design: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods: Cost estimates of service provision for HIV-positive children and adults by stage of HIV infection were combined with estimates of health benefits for infants and parents and with costs of counselling and testing (testing costs). In a pharmacoeconomic model cost effectiveness was estimated for expanded antenatal <b>HIV</b> testing <b>in</b> London for universal and selective strategies. Results: Testing costs in the plausible range of pound 4 to pound 40 translate into favourable incremental cost-effectiveness estimates for expanded antenatal <b>HIV</b> testing <b>in</b> London which is already at low numbers of vertical transmissions averted per 100000 pregnant women who test HIV-negative in early pregnancy. Favourable cost effectiveness for universal expanded testing would require testing costs in the lower range, whereas selective expanded testing may produce favourable cost effectiveness at testing costs close to pound 40. Conclusion: Based on pharmaco-economic considerations, the authors believe that implementation of expanded <b>HIV</b> testing <b>in</b> London should be considered.

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore.

5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.

5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of <b>HIV</b> <b>in</b> a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E

40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To compare <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> antenatal clinics (ANC) {{and the general}} population, and to identify factors determining the differences that were found. DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys {{in the general population}} and in ANC in three cities. METHODS: <b>HIV</b> prevalence measured <b>in</b> adults in the community was compared with that measured by sentinel surveillance in ANC in Yaoundé, Cameroon, Kisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia. RESULTS: In Yaoundé and Ndola, the <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> ANC attenders was lower than that in women in the population overall, and for age groups over 20 years. <b>In</b> Kisumu, the <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> ANC attenders was similar to that in women in the population at all ages. The only factors identified that influenced the results were age, marital status, parity, schooling, and contraceptive use. The <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> women in ANC was similar to that in the combined male and female population aged 15 - 40 years in Yaoundé and Ndola, but overestimated it in Kisumu. In Yaoundé and Ndola, the overall <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> men was approximated by using the age of the father of the child reported by ANC attenders, but this method overestimated the <b>HIV</b> prevalence <b>in</b> Kisumu, and did not give good age-specific estimates. CONCLUSION: Few factors influenced the difference <b>in</b> <b>HIV</b> prevalence between ANC and the population, which could aid the development of adjustment procedures to estimate population HIV prevalence.
