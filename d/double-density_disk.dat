50|$|The disk format {{itself had}} no more {{capacity}} than the more popular (and cheaper) 5¼-inch floppies. Each side of a <b>double-density</b> <b>disk</b> held 180 KB {{for a total of}} 360 KB per disk, and 720 KB for quad-density disks. Unlike 5¼-inch or 3½-inch disks, the 3-inch disks were designed to be reversible and sported two independent write-protect switches. It was also more reliable thanks to its hard casing.|$|E
50|$|DOS XL was {{designed}} to replace OS/A+. Included support for single and <b>double-density</b> <b>disk</b> drives. Utilized the command-prompt of OS/A+ but also included a menu program. Featured extensions that took advantage of unused memory space in Atari XL/XE computers and OSS supercartridges. Included support for Indus GT Synchromesh. Due to lack of demand and Atari {{working on a new}} version of DOS, OSS decided to halt development of DOS XL 4 and reissue OS/A+ version 4.1.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-piracy {{measures}} {{included the}} practice of distributing software on disks that contained secret [...] "keys" [...] on high-numbered tracks that were officially unused. The Amiga disk drive officially supported tracks 0-79 from a <b>double-density</b> <b>disk,</b> but could actually read tracks 80 through 82. Standard disk-imaging software ignored these tracks, so that a duplicate of a boxed disk would not contain the key and the software would not work. A similar technique involved writing to normally-unused sectors of the disk. Copy software called [...] "nibble" [...] copiers appeared that could exactly reproduce such disks.|$|E
50|$|North Star later updated {{the disk}} drive to support <b>double-density</b> <b>disks</b> with 180 kB, and later still double-sided, <b>double-density</b> <b>disks</b> with 360 kB of storage. However, the double-density product was pre-announced {{and sales of}} the {{original}} single-density, single-sided model ended overnight. The sudden loss of income almost bankrupted the company, and is used {{as an example of}} the Osborne effect in action.|$|R
50|$|When the Atari XF551 drive came out, {{not only}} was it Atari's first drive that could read <b>double-density</b> <b>disks,</b> it was also {{double-sided}}. So support was added in the DOS for <b>double-density</b> and double-sided <b>disks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Version 2.0S was for single-density disks, 2.0D was for <b>double-density</b> <b>disks.</b> 2.0D shipped {{with the}} 815 Dual Disk Drive, which was both {{expensive}} and {{incompatible with the}} standard 810, and thus sold only a small number; making DOS version 2.0D rare and unusual.|$|R
50|$|Except for labeling, 5¼-inch {{high-density}} disks were externally {{identical to}} their double-density counterparts. This {{led to an}} odd situation wherein the drive itself was unable to determine {{the density of the}} disk inserted except by reading the disk media to determine the format. It was therefore possible to use a high-density drive to format a <b>double-density</b> <b>disk</b> to the higher capacity. This usually appeared to work (sometimes reporting a small number of bad sectors)—at least for a time. The problem was that the high-density format was made possible by {{the creation of a new}} high-coercivity oxide coating (after soft-sector formatting became standard, previous increases in density were largely enabled by improvements in head technology; up until that point, the media formulation had essentially remained the same since 1976). In order to format or write to this high-coercivity media, the high-density drive switched its heads into a mode using a stronger magnetic field. When these stronger fields were written onto a <b>double-density</b> <b>disk</b> (having lower coercivity media), the strongly magnetized oxide particles would begin to affect the magnetic charge of adjacent particles. The net effect is that the disk would begin to erase itself. On the other hand, the opposite procedure (attempting to format an HD disk as DD) would fail almost every time, as the high-coercivity media would not retain data written by the low-power DD field. High-density 3½-inch disks avoided this problem by the addition of a hole in the disk cartridge so that the drive could determine the appropriate density. However, the coercivity rating between the 3½-inch DD and HD formats, 665 and 720 oersteds, is much narrower than that for the 5¼-inch format, 600 versus 300 oersteds, and consequently it was possible to format a 3½-inch DD disk as HD with no apparent problems.|$|E

5000|$|The CMD FD {{series was}} Creative Micro Designs (CMD)'s range of {{third-party}} floppy disk drives for the Commodore 8-bit line of home computers. Using 3½" [...] floppy disks, they provided a significantly larger storage capacity than Commodore-produced drives; the FD-2000 offered 1600 kB of storage using standard double-sided, high-density floppies, while the FD-4000 also allowed {{the use of}} 3200 kB extra-high density (ED) floppies. In contrast, the Commodore 1581 3½" [...] drive only supported 800 kB double-sided, <b>double-density</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1984, {{along with}} the IBM PC/AT, the high density disk appeared, which used 96 tracks per inch {{combined}} with a higher density magnetic media to provide 1,200 KB of storage (formally referred to as 1.2 megabytes). Since the usual (very expensive) hard disk held 10 - 20 megabytes at the time, this was considered quite spacious. High-density drives could also read and write to <b>double-density</b> <b>disks,</b> allowing an upgrade path. However, there were compatibility problems, in particular with non-HD drives failing to read 360 KB disks written by 1200 KB drives due to their narrower track write head.|$|R

50|$|The DSS-1 has its {{operating}} system stored on ROM chips, {{so if you}} lose your floppy disks you can still boot the system up (unlike the E-mu Emulator, Ensoniq Mirage, and early Roland samplers which required you always have a floppy disk containing the OS). However, each time you boot up the DSS-1 you will not have any sounds available until you load a system into memory from floppy disk. This can usually take anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds, depending on the size and number of multisamples contained in that system.

The drive stores 800 kilobytes using an MFM encoding but format different from MS-DOS (720 kB), Amiga (880 kB), and Mac Plus (800 kB) formats. With special software it's possible to read C1581 disks on an x86 PC system, and likewise, read MS-DOS and other formats of disks in the C1581 (using Big Blue Reader), provided that the PC or other floppy handles the [...] "720 kB" [...] size format.

50|$|Like the 5¼-inch, the 3½-inch disk {{underwent}} {{an evolution}} of its own. When Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984, it used single-sided 3½-inch disk drives with an advertised capacity of 400 kB. The encoding technique used by these drives {{was known as}} GCR, or Group Coded Recording (similar recording methods were used by Commodore on its 5¼-inch drives and Sirius Systems Technology in its Victor 9000 non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine). Somewhat later, PC-compatible machines began using single-sided 3½-inch disks with an advertised capacity of 360 kB (the same as a double-sided 5¼-inch disk), and a different, incompatible recording format called MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation). GCR and MFM drives (and their formatted disks) were incompatible, although the physical disks were the same. In 1986, Apple introduced double-sided, 800 kB disks, still using GCR, and soon after, IBM began using 720 kB double-sided <b>double-density</b> MFM <b>disks</b> in PCs like the IBM PC Convertible. IBM PC compatibles adopted it too, whilst the Amiga used MFM encoding on the same disks to give a capacity of 1 MB (880 KB available once formatted).|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore 1571 is Commodore's {{high-end}} 5¼" [...] {{floppy disk}} drive. With its double-sided drive mechanism, {{it has the}} ability to use double-sided, <b>double-density</b> (DS/DD) floppy <b>disks</b> natively. This is in contrast to its predecessors, the 1541 and 1570, which can fully read and write such disks only if the user manually flipped them over to access the second side. Because flipping the disk also reverses the direction of rotation, the two methods are not interchangeable; disks which had their back side created in a 1541 by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the 1571 too, and the back side of disks written in a 1571 using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a 1541.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, Shugart Associates {{introduced}} the first 5¼-inch FDD. By 1978 {{there were more}} than 10 manufacturers producing such FDDs. There were competing floppy disk formats, with hard- and soft-sector versions and encoding schemes such as FM, MFM, M²FM and GCR. The 5¼-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most applications, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared. The most common capacity of the 5¼-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360KB. [...] In 1984 IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided floppy disk, but it never became very popular. IBM started using the 720KB <b>double-density</b> 3½-inch microfloppy <b>disk</b> on its Convertible laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44MB high-density version with the PS/2 line in 1987. These disk drives could be added to older PC models. In 1988 IBM introduced a drive for 2.88MB [...] "DSED" [...] diskettes in its top-of-the-line PS/2 models, but this was a commercial failure.|$|R
