2500|$|Today {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} {{controversy}} again in 2002, when its editor Rod Liddle wrote a column in The Guardian that was extremely critical of the Countryside Alliance and which raised questions about his own impartiality. In the article, he wrote that catching [...] "a glimpse of the forces supporting the Countryside Alliance: the public schools that laid on coaches; the <b>fusty,</b> belch-filled dining rooms of the London clubs that opened their doors, for the first time, to the protesters; the Prince of Wales and, of course, Camilla ... and suddenly, rather gloriously, it might be that you remember [...] once again."

2500|$|IGN's Chad Grischow {{described}} Spirit as the [...] "perfect {{showcase for}} [...] fantastic skills", praising {{her ability to}} sing both upbeat tracks and [...] "tender piano ballads". Sarah-Louise James from the Daily Star gave a positive review, saying, [...] "Fans of her sweet, soaring vocals and power ballads won't be disappointed." [...] Chris Elwell-Sutton of the Evening Standard said that Spirit will be [...] "a very successful album with some much-needed grit." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, claiming that although Lewis had a pallet of different producers working with her, they managed to prevent her from sounding [...] "too <b>fusty</b> or old-fashioned." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said [...] "Lewis can hit those big notes but make it seem easy, never straining her voice and building nicely to the climax. Unlike most divas, there is a human quality to her voice, as she's singing to the song, not singing to her voice." [...] He compared it to Mariah Carey's debut album, but criticised the old-fashioned sound. Popjustice's review was brief, summing up that [...] " [...] has four absolutely blinding tracks on it, three far better than average tracks on it, and some others which are quite good. There are no totally chronic songs on Spirit apart from 'A Moment Like This'." [...] The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman praised Lewis's ability to make unremarkable songs sound impressive, saying [...] "The tracks are impeccably manicured, super-tuneful, and offer lyrics about the various agonies and ecstasies of love that are unremarkable in and of themselves but reach nuclear-threat levels of desperation thanks to Lewis's voice." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a cold, cheerless {{afternoon}} in November as Mr. Hyams, who had occasional hazy ideas of hygiene, stood {{at his door}} taking the air. It was an atmosphere laden with soot and redolent of many blended odors, but after the <b>fusty</b> smell of the shop it was almost health-giving. In the large public-house opposite, with its dirty windows and faded signboards, the gas was already being lit, which should change it from its daylight dreariness to a resort of light and life.|$|E
60|$|So the plenishing {{was of the}} simplest. The {{walls were}} covered with {{tapestry}} so faded that the pattern could hardly be detected.

"My Lady {{has given}} it to you well, Mistress Really or Mistress Falsely, which ever you may be," [...] mumbled Madge, perhaps in soliloquy, fumbling at the lock of a room which at last she opened. It smelt very close and <b>fusty,</b> {{and most of the}} {{furniture}} was heaped together under a cloth in the midst, dimly visible by the light of a heart-shaped aperture in the shutters. Unclosing one of the leaves, the old woman admitted enough daylight to guide Aurelia to a couch against the wall, saying, [...] "You can wait there till I see to your bed.

[...] Haco bowed {{and left the room}} quite modestly, for he hated the very {{appearance}} of boasting; but {{when he was in the}} passage his teeth snapped together like nut-crackers as he compressed his lips, and on gaining the street he put on his hat with a bang that would have ruinously crushed it had it not been made of some glazed material that was evidently indestructible.|$|E
60|$|I had {{sat there}} listlessly, {{sketching}} and musing, for about twenty minutes, when I saw a sight I can never resist. A beautiful butterfly, {{of a species}} quite new to me, attracted my attention {{on the side of}} the crater-wall over which my legs were carelessly dangling. Now, though I am by trade (saving your presence) a seismologist and vulcanologist--no offence meant by those awesome words--I've always had a sneaking kindness in an underhand way for other departments of natural science, especially zoology; and a new butterfly, with a red spot on its tail, is a severe temptation that my utmost philosophy can never induce me to disregard under any circumstances. There are some scientific men, I know, who seem to think science ought to be made as dull and as dry and as <b>fusty</b> as possible: for my own part, I never could take that eminently correct and respectable view: I like my science as amusing as I can get it, with a considerable spice of adventure thrown in; and I prefer specimen-hunting among the Pacific Islands to name-hunting among the prodigiously learned and stupid memoirs of the British Museum. Between ourselves, too (but I wouldn't like this to reach the ears of the Royal Society), I regard a man as much more useful to science when engaged in catching birds or insects in the Malay Archipelago or the African mountains than when inventing names for them out of his own head in a <b>fusty,</b> dusty, musty room in the museum at South Kensington. Have the kindness to keep this dark however if you ever go to a British Association Meeting: for if it reached the ears of the Committee, they might think me an unfit person to entrust with any further volcanic investigations.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Grant {{got into}} his sleigh, and Breckenridge, who had been vanquished by Miss Schuyler in an exchange of badinage, found him somewhat silent during the journey to Fremont ranch. He retired to rest soon after they reached it, and set out again before daylight the next morning, and it was late at night {{when he came back}} very weary, with his garments stiff with frost. The great bare room where Breckenridge awaited him was filled with a <b>fusty</b> heat, and as he came in, partly dazed by the change of temperature, Grant did not see the other man who sat amidst the tobacco-smoke beside the glowing stove. He sank into a hide chair limply, and when Breckenridge glanced at him inquiringly, with numbed fingers dragged a wallet out of his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|Farther back, on the landward {{side of our}} {{unobtrusive}} street, {{commercial and}} nautical elements were more mingled with things appertaining to domestic life. Elephantine horses, addicted to good living, drew through the narrow streets wagons and vans so ponderous and gigantic that they seemed to crush the very stones over which they rolled, and ran terrible risk of sweeping little children out of the upper windows of the houses. In unfavourable contrast with these, donkeys, of the most meagre and starved aspect, staggered along with cartloads of <b>fusty</b> vegetables and dirty-looking fish, while the vendors thereof howled the nature and value of their wares with deliberate ferocity. Low pawnbrokers (chiefly in the [...] "slop" [...] line) obtruded their seedy wares from doors and windows halfway across the pavement, as if to tempt the naked; and equally low pastry-cooks spread forth their stale viands in unglazed windows, as if to seduce the hungry.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she came}} close {{and looked in}} she beheld indistinct forms racing up {{and down to the}} figure of the dance, the silence of their footfalls arising from their being {{overshoe}} in [...] "scroff"--that is to say, the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products, the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene. Through this floating, <b>fusty</b> debris of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out. They coughed as they danced, and laughed as they coughed. Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lights--the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs--a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus, and always failing.|$|E
