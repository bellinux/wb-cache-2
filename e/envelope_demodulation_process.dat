Thus, it is the key of fault diagnosis to extract the fault feature from vibration signal. Therefore, a fault feature extraction method for the rolling bearing based on the local mean decomposition (LMD) and <b>envelope</b> <b>demodulation</b> is proposed. Firstly, decompose the original vibration signal by LMD to get a series of production functions (PFs). Then dispose the <b>envelope</b> <b>demodulation</b> analysis on PF component.

40|$|Wheel-bearings easily acquire defects due {{to their}} {{high-speed}} operating conditions and constant metal-metal contact, so defect detection is of great importance for railroad safety. The conventional spectral kurtosis (SK) technique provides an optimal bandwidth for <b>envelope</b> <b>demodulation.</b> However, this technique may cause false detections when processing real vibration signals for wheel-bearings, because of sparse interference impulses. In this paper, a novel defect detection method with entropy, time-spectral kurtosis (TSK) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. In this method, the possible outliers {{in the short time}} Fourier transform (STFT) amplitude series are first estimated and preprocessed with information entropy. Then the method extends the SK technique to the time-domain, and extracts defective frequencies from reconstructed vibration signals by TSK filtering. Finally, the multi-class SVM was applied to classify bearing defects. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using real wheel-bearing vibration signals.

40|$|Vibration {{signals of}} rolling element {{bearings}} faults are usually immersed in background noise, {{which makes it}} difficult to detect the faults. Wavelet-based methods being used commonly can reduce some types of noise, but there is still plenty of room for improvement due to the insufficient sparseness of vibration signals in wavelet domain. In this work, in order to eliminate noise and enhance the weak fault detection, a new kind of peak-based approach combined with multiscale decomposition and <b>envelope</b> <b>demodulation</b> is developed. First, to preserve effective middle-low frequency signals while making high frequency noise more significant, a peak-based piecewise recombination is utilized to convert middle frequency components into low frequency ones. The newly generated signal becomes so smoother that it will have a sparser representation in wavelet domain. Then a noise threshold is applied after wavelet multiscale decomposition, followed by inverse wavelet transform and backward peak-based piecewise transform. Finally, the amplitude of fault characteristic frequency is enhanced by means of <b>envelope</b> <b>demodulation.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by rolling bearings faults experiments. Compared with traditional wavelet-based analysis, experimental results show that fault features can be enhanced significantly and detected easily by the proposed method...|$|R

As MSB results highlight the modulation effects by suppressing stationary random noise and discrete aperiodic impulses, the detector developed using high magnitudes of MSB can provide optimal frequency bands for fault detection straightforward. Performance evaluation results using both simulated data and experimental data show that the proposed method produces more effective and robust detection results for different types of bearing faults, compared with optimal envelope analysis using fast Kurtogram...|$|R
