25|$|A heartbroken Rapunzel grieves for Eugene. However, her tears, {{which still}} contain {{a bit of}} the sun's power, land on <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> restore his life.

25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious wound on <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
60|$|He was chiefly {{aware that}} Chitterlow was an {{overwhelming}} personality. He puffed <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> blew.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the cut on Gerald's forehead, noted the access of colour in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> nodded.|$|R

25|$|A {{few days}} after {{claiming}} his 171st aerial victory, Schuck was wounded by glass splinters that struck <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> nose. A splinter penetrated his jaw and got stuck {{in one of his}} teeth. To remove this splinter he required surgery. While in the hospital recovering from this operation, Schuck received notice that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. The presentation of the Oak Leaves was made on 7 November 1944 at the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM— Ministry of Aviation) in Berlin by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Schuck received this award together with twelve other soldiers on this day, among them were the Fallschirmjäger Generalmajor Heinz Trettner, Oberstleutnant Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte, and the ground attack and bomber pilots Hauptmann Franz Kieslich and Hauptmann Diether Lukesch. Schuck was the only fighter pilot so honored on this day.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E
25|$|He led {{the unit}} in the {{fighting}} at the Second Battle of El Alamein from July 1942, planning and executing the capture of Trig 29 on 26 July. In the last attack launched by the division on 30/31 October the 2/48th Infantry Battalion was ordered {{to take a position}} known as the Cloverleaf. During the attack, Hammer sustained a gunshot wound to his right cheek. The German bullet pieced <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> exited through to the other side, but did not touch any bones or teeth. At the same time he took two German prisoners. With only 41 of his men remaining, he withdrew and by dawn they had dug in. He continued to command the 2/48th Infantry Battalion until it was withdrawn from the Middle East and brought back to Australia in early 1943. In January 1943, he was invested with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions in the Middle East.|$|E

6000|$|... "Gentlemen----" [...] piped Sir John, {{with all}} the pippin hue gone from <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> rubbing <b>his</b> white hands {{together}} nervously.|$|R
60|$|Brooke nodded comprehendingly, but Barbara {{noticed that}} the blood was in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> he smiled in a very curious fashion.|$|R
500|$|Strang was hit three times: one bullet grazed his head, another {{lodged in}} <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> {{a third in}} his spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. [...] One of the assassins then savagely pistol-whipped the victim before running aboard the nearby vessel with his companion, where both claimed sanctuary. [...] Some accused Captain McBlair of the Michigan of {{complicity}} in, or at least foreknowledge of, the assassination plot, though no hard evidence of this was ever forthcoming. [...] The [...] "King of Beaver Island" [...] was taken to Voree, where he lived for three weeks, dying on July 9, 1856 {{at the age of}} 43. [...] After refusing to deliver Bedford and Wentworth to the local sheriff, McBlair transported them to Mackinac Island, where they were given a mock trial, fined $1.25, released, and then feted by the locals. [...] None of the plotters was ever punished for his crimes.|$|E
500|$|Measuring , Torpedo...Los! is an oil {{on canvas}} painting. By {{enlarging}} {{the face of the}} captain relative to the entire field, Lichtenstein makes him more prominent than in the source. He retained the source's [...] "clumsiness" [...] in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter [...] "cryptic command". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar from his nose to <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him with his mouth wide open, also opting to leave the eye which was not looking through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story.|$|E
500|$|Sasse, {{described}} by official historian Charles Bean as [...] "elated" [...] by the achievement that morning, approached Shout {{with a proposal}} to repeat the feat. Shout agreed. The duo assembled a party of eight men this time to carry sandbags and extra bombs. Having reconnoitred the Turks' position, the previously erected barricade was shoved down and, side-by-side, Sasse and Shout ran forward. While Sasse fired his revolver and Shout lobbed bombs, the Australian party advanced in short stages along the trench and built a barricade each time they halted. Bean wrote that Shout fought with [...] "splendid gaiety" [...] throughout the assault, historian Stephen Snelling adding that Shout was [...] "laughing and joking and cheering his men on". As the Australians progressed, the two officers located a suitable position to raise their final barricade. Readying himself for this final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs. He successfully threw two, but the third burst {{just as it was}} leaving his hand. Shout was grievously wounded; the explosion incinerated his right hand and part of the left, destroyed his left eye, cut <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> caused burns to his chest and leg. Despite the severity of his wounds Shout remained conscious and was dragged out of the firing line, where, [...] "still cheerful" [...] according to Bean, he [...] "drank tea and sent a message to his wife".|$|E
60|$|The Major heaved <b>his</b> shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> laughed {{more like}} an over-fed Mephistopheles than ever, as he said the words.|$|R

2500|$|Rahman got a {{relatively}} late {{start in the}} sport. [...] He was an enforcer for drug dealers, and was known for surviving several shootings. [...] He nearly {{died in a car}} accident (which left him with permanent scarring on <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> ear) and once survived a shooting where five bullets entered his body. [...] He took up boxing at age 20 and had just 10 amateur bouts before making his pro debut on December 3, 1994, at age 22. He is a devout Muslim.|$|E
2500|$|The Godfather {{was first}} {{announced}} by Electronic Arts on March 10, 2004. Speaking at the Bear Stearns Media, Entertainment & Information Conference in Palm Beach, Florida, EA's CFO Warren Jensen confirmed rumors that EA {{were working on}} a Godfather game. No other details were revealed {{except for the fact}} that it would [...] "likely be an M-rated game," [...] making it EA's first ever M-rated title. The game was first shown at the 2004 Spike Video Game Awards on December 14. Slated for a third quarter release in 2005 on as yet unspecified current generation systems, EA showed a pre-rendered cutscene depicting Vito Corleone drinking wine, scratching <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> then looking into the camera and saying [...] "Some day, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this, as a gift." ...|$|E

50|$|Charged {{into the}} enemy's ranks and {{captured}} a battle flag, having a horse shot under him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> shoulders {{cut with a}} saber.|$|R
60|$|She smiled, {{and kissed}} <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> still held his hand. 'Adrian,' she said.|$|E
60|$|Young Rags put the quid in <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{went away}} humming a tune.|$|E
60|$|The {{form was}} that of Luke Peterson, and <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> temple were covered with blood.|$|E
6000|$|Was it {{death that}} spread the livid pallor over <b>his</b> {{forehead}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> the dull leaden hue on his eyelids and his lips? ...|$|R
6000|$|But Stalky {{puffed out}} <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> squinted down <b>his</b> {{nose in the}} style of Panurge, and all he said was, [...] "Oh, you abject burblers!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped for}} a moment, and when he went on again the firelight showed the little flush in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> the gleam in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Chattily, Carl went back, {{lifted her}} again, endured her kissing <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> they started on.|$|E
60|$|The old rancher seemed {{genuinely}} shocked. Red tinged <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> a flame flared in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|A smile {{played on}} her lips, as she kissed <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> entreated {{him to be}} of of good cheer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes, if you like," [...] I replied, in surprise. He was pale; {{there were}} red spots in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> dark lines under his weary eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would you?" [...] cries George, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> Theo's {{simultaneously}} flushed up with red; I suppose {{because they}} both saw Hetty's bright young eyes watching them.|$|R
