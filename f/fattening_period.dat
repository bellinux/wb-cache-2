50|$|Outdoor pig {{production}} has historical traditions, especially in Europe. Both the sows and finishing pigs are kept permanently on pasture, including during winter months for sows. The majority of growing or ‘feeder’ pigs are moved indoors for the <b>fattening</b> <b>period,</b> e.g. {{to a deep}} litter system. Animals are more environmentally adapted to outdoor surroundings, as breeding and genetics play an important role. Additionally, a major difference between conventional, outdoor production and organic production is the high proportion of silage and roughage in the organic feed. Therefore, finding adequate protein and proper nutrition are often challenges for many farmers.|$|E
50|$|The country's {{breeding}} stock was primarily Spanish criollo, although {{over the years}} considerable crossbreeding with English breeds and zebu cattle from Brazil had taken place. Although cattle were numerous in Paraguay, the country lacked {{a sufficient number of}} pure-bred breeding cattle. The livestock sector also suffered from a low calving percentage, a high mortality rate, and a long <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> for steers. Artificial insemination was increasingly common. To a certain extent, cattle raising reflected the disparities in agriculture in general. There were numerous farmers who owned only a few head of relatively unproductive cattle that were slaughtered for the local market under relatively poor sanitary conditions. By contrast, extremely large cattle ranches typically were owned by expatriates and butchered more productive animals for both national and international markets.|$|E
50|$|Adult {{mountain}} {{pygmy possums}} enter hibernation {{for a period}} of up to seven months, whereas juveniles generally hibernate for about five months. Both males and females rely heavily on Bogong moths as an energy rich food and for the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> which occurs prior to hibernation. Mountain pygmy possums are also noted to cache seeds and berries which they will feed on during periods when they awaken from torpor. During the months of hibernation, Burramys parvus is noted to awaken from torpor for periods of two to three days at a time during which the animal will feed on cached food resources. These periods of arousal typically occur when the ambient temperature is 4-7 ˚C. During the hibernating period, the mountain pygmy possum is capable of reducing its temperature to 2 ˚C. Individuals in torpid periods will curl their bodies up, tucking their heads into their chest or abdomen in order to retain body heat. In addition, females have been observed sharing nests constructed from moss and snow grass. Both males and females are noted to hibernate under an insulating layer of snow.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present trial {{was to determine the}} effect of a thermostable probiotic containing Bacillus licheniformis and B. subtilis on health and production parameters of fattening rabbits from weaning until slaughter. In a rabbitry with average post-weaning mortality of 5 - 9 %, 1680 rabbits in 2 treatment groups (4 weaning batches, 105 cages per treatment, each cage of 8 rabbits) were fed with: a) a basic feedor; b) the same basic feed supplemented with probiotic from the 4 th day postweaning (41 th days of age) up to 88 th day of age. The rabbits were slaughtered on an average of 93 days. Clinical signs, microbiological status (enumeration of E. coli and C. perfringens and presence of P. multocida) and growth performance were recorded for two distinct <b>fattening</b> <b>periods,</b> growing and finishing. A significant decrease in mortality of probiotic-treated rabbits when compared to the control ones was observed during growing and entire <b>fattening</b> <b>periods.</b> Within these periods, E. coli and C. perfringens – but not P. multocida – were isolated at a lower frequency from probiotic treated rabbits (P< 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} feeding by-product feed (BF) -based silage on the performance, blood metabolite parameters, and carcass characteristics of Hanwoo steers. The BF-based silage was composed of 50 % spent mushroom substrate, 21 % recycled poultry bedding, 15 % cut ryegrass straw, 10. 8 % rice bran, 2 % molasses, 0. 6 % bentonite, and 0. 6 % microbial additive (on a wet basis), and ensiled for over 5 d. Fifteen steers were allocated to three diets during the growing and <b>fattening</b> <b>periods</b> (3. 1 and 9. 8 months, respectively) : a control diet (concentrate mix and free access to rice straw), a 50 % BF-based silage diet (control diet+ 50 % of maximum BF-based silage intake), and a 100 % BF-based silage diet (the same amount of concentrate mix and ad libitum BF-based silage). The BF-based silage was fed during the growing and <b>fattening</b> <b>periods,</b> and was replaced with larger particles of rice straw during the finishing period. After 19. 6 months of the whole period all the steers were slaughtered. Compared with feeding rice straw, feeding BF-based silage tended (p = 0. 10) to increase the average daily gain (27 %) and feed efficiency (18 %) of the growing steers, caused by increased voluntary feed intake. Feeding BF-based silage had little effect on serum constituents, electrolytes, enzymes, or the blood cell profiles of fattening steers, except for low serum Ca and high blood urea concentrations (p< 0. 05). Feeding BF-based silage did not affect cold carcass weight, yield traits such as back fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, yield index or yield grade, or quality traits such as meat color, fat color, texture, maturity, marbling score, or quality grade. However, it improved good quality grade (1 + and 1 ++) appearance rates (60 % for the control group vs 100 % for the BF-based silage-fed groups). In conclusion, cheap BF-based silage could be successfully used as a good quality roughage source for beef cattle...|$|R
50|$|Routine {{anthelmintic}} treatments, {{commonly used}} in intensive pig rearing systems, are not systematic and treatment schemes vary according to farm and animal category. The breeding stock is usually treated with 3-4 month intervals or prior to farrowing. (Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Piglets are typically treated upon entering the fattening units and maybe once more halfway the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> However, these treatment schemes seem to be unable to significantly decrease the infection intensity on a farm. Treatment frequency {{must be based on}} the prepatent period of the worm species. For Ascaris this is 42 days. However, when anthelmintic treatment is ineffective i/n killing the migrating larval stages, it is possible that egg shedding occurs earlier as larvae remain in the lung up to 10 days post infection (Roepstorff et al., 1997). Treatment of pigs every 5 weeks would therefore eliminate the worms before they are able to produce millions of eggs and contaminate the environment all over again. When a strict deworming process is applied, the infectivity of the environment will drop, as new hosts will take up eggs from the environment, and eggs will be swept away by cleaning actions or eventually lose their viability. This will ultimately result in a stock of pigs with a reduced or absent parasitic burden. It is important to understand that persistence in the repeated application of the anthelmintic is necessary. If the environmental contamination is high, it will most likely take several fattening rounds to eventually reduce the infection pressure (Bakker, 1984; Jourquin, 2007).Both the fact that infections usually seem to occur in the fattening units and the fact that anthelmintic treatment has limited persistent activity against recurring infectious larvae lead to believe that the common practice of treating pigs prior to, or upon arrival in the fattening units, might be superfluous. In two experiments, {{it has been reported that}} a single anthelmintic treatment of fatteners at the start of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> is not justified on economie grounds. It showed to be ineffective in reducing parasite prevalence and it did not have a positive effect on performance results, nor did it influence the incidence of other lesions like white spots (Boes et al., 2010; Nilsson, 1982; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990). More importantly, Roepstorff (1997) showed that, depending on the infection status, it might sometimes be more economically beneficial to switch from a routine anthelmintic treatment program to the conditional usage of anthelmintics, treating only when parasite levels reach an unacceptable level. This should however be supported by routine diagnostic screening of pigs from different age categories and is probably only applicable to farms with moderate to highly intensive management.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of these field trials, {{it became clear that}} locusts and {{grasshoppers}} are able to detect that they have become infected and alter their behaviour accordingly. In particular, they spend more time basking in the sun, even {{in the middle of the}} day. Uninfected grasshoppers also bask in the sun when their body temperature is below the preferred 38-40 °C. However, detailed investigations showed that infected grasshoppers increase their body temperature to up to 4° higher. This effect has been dubbed “behavioural fever” and is thought to slow down the infection just like a fever in warm-blooded animals does. This basking behaviour poses a potential problem for the fungus. The latter's preferred temperature is 28-30 °C and it stops growing above 35°. Measurements of body temperatures in the field have shown that the basking behaviour reduces the time available for growth by many hours per day. Under certain conditions, this enables the insects to lay at least one egg pod before dying. Interestingly, healthy locusts and grasshoppers, especially females, take some time after fledging to reach maturity and lay eggs, during which time they build up sufficient fat to produce up to three egg pods. However, infected ones usually dispense with this <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> and go on to produce eggs immediately after fledging. This generally wears them out so much that they die after laying one pod. So even if Metarhizium does not kill before or shortly after fledging, it usually allows the formation of only a single egg pod and thereby reduces the fecundity of infected females.|$|E
5000|$|A 1978 {{study showed}} that Dutch Landrace pigs are {{especially}} responsive [...] - [...] compared, for example, to the Dutch Yorkshire crossbreed [...] - [...] to the halothane-induced malignant hyperthermia test (halothane test, for short), {{which can be used}} to weed out specimens with high susceptibility to stress and likely abnormal meat quality. [...] Dutch Landraces are responsive 22% of the time (vs. 3% for Dutch Yorkshires), and those responsive to the test are almost ten times likelier to die during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> than responsive Dutch Yorkshires. [...] Two 1980 follow-up studies by the same team of researchers found that the Dutch Landrace's susceptibility is inherited as [...] "a single recessive autosomal trait", and [...] "the gene for this trait affects production traits", including carcass and meat quality. [...] Three genotypes (genetic strains) have been identified in the breed: Heterozygous for (carrying but not expressing) the gene, and homozygous either for (expressing) the gene, or not possessing it at all. The heterozygous has an intermediate carcass and meat quality and a selection advantage. The homozygous for reactivity to halothane had lowest meat quality, though highest meat production of the three genotypes, and as noted in the first study, its high reactivity level can be used for screening. [...] It also has the lowest percentage loss at slaughter. Halothene-reactive castrated males, as opposed to un-modified boars, differed from non-reactive in [...] "all carcass and meat quality traits", and had [...] "significantly lower feed conversion ratios". Halothene reactivity seems to be more heritable from the sire than the dam; in a population with an average 24.9% of individuals being reactive, 40.7% of those with reacting sires were themselves reactive, vs. 21.3% without.|$|E

30|$|The Sahrawi's {{traditional}} pastoral territory {{was almost}} inaccessible to pastoralists while engulfed in war from 1975 to 1991 but, since then, the ‘liberated’ {{areas have been}} key to the re-emergence of camel husbandry and camel-related practices among refugees as they provide grazing resources for refugees’ and nomads’ herds, {{as well as a}} place for nomads to live and refugees to move in seasonal or ‘holiday’ nomadism. Refugees’ use of the liberated territories and northern Mauritania (where the Sahrawi have free informal access) for pasturing herds is informed by an economic rationale related to the emergent markets for livestock and livestock products in the refugee camps, as camel herds spend fallow or <b>fattening</b> <b>periods</b> in free-grazing conditions in these regions. This is especially the case for refugees with larger herds: in milk enterprises, fallow she-camels are grazed in the liberated territories as long as forage plants are available (after rains) to ‘keep them healthy with good forage’ and save the cost of feeding them in the camps on cut fodder. In meat enterprises, especially after rains, refugee herders use the liberated territories to fatten camels and small livestock before selling or slaughtering them in the camps.|$|R

Simulated ammonia emission levels were compared with measured levels for 1 day in each 3 -week <b>period</b> during two <b>fattening</b> <b>periods</b> of 15 weeks (one in winter and one in summer) in each of three fattening compartments. The overall mean ammonia emission measured was 6. 84 g d- 1 pig- 1, while the mean overall simulated emission was 6. 36 g d- 1 pig- 1, with 1. 96 g d- 1 pig- 1 simulated to volatilize {{from the floor and}} 4. 40 g d- 1 pig- 1 from the slurry pit.

Very high energy consumption in the fattening stage of 35 to 70 kg resulted in a decline of weight and protein deposition {{at the end of the}} <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> from about go kg live weight onwards. It cannot be compensated for by a high protein supplementation. At a finishing weight of r 20 kg a too intensive nutrient level (more than 650 g gain /day) at the first fattening stage proved to be unfavourable. The resulting depression of protein deposition in the second <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> accounts for an insufficient expression of the muscle growth potential. It is defined as the upper limit of protein deposition (and consequently lean meat production) in a fattening animal at a given final weight for minimizing both the fattening length and fat depo-sition. When producing heavy pigs, a reduction of energy supply during the second half of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> is not advisable when using modern crossbred lean pigs. On the contrary, all efforts should be made so that the energy intake during the second half of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> is not limiting for lean tissue growth...|$|E
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: Bearing in mind certain established European Union {{regulations on}} the conventional extensive broiler rearing {{system as well}} as poultry breeding specificities of our country, experimental investigations were organised {{with the aim of}} making a comparison between broiler growth in two different non-industrial rearing systems. The systems included extensive fattening in a poultry house and free-range rearing. The <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> in both rearing systems lasted up to the 63 rd day of broiler age. During the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> chicken growth was controlled by individual chicken weighing on a weekly basis. Based on the research results it was determined that the growth of broilers in both rearing systems was similar up to the 49 th day of age. The differences established were small and statistically insignificant (P> 0. 05). The controls at 56 and 63 days of age showed somewhat higher differences in mean body weights of chicks. The difference determined on the 63 rd day was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). From the results mentioned it could be concluded that the differences in broiler growth between the rearing systems examined increased with the prolongation of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Key words: chickens, rearing systems, age, body weight...|$|E
40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare growth performance, blood components and carcass traits by two feeding systems (concentrate with roughage separately [CON] vs total mixed ration [TMR]) in Hanwoo steers, and to learn the relationship between blood components during fattening or finishing phases and carcass traits in Hanwoo steers. Methods Sixty steers aged 8 months were allotted to two feeding systems and fed similar amounts of average dry matter and total digestible nutrient throughout whole experimental period according to each feeding program. Steers were weighed monthly, taken blood at the end of growing, <b>fattening</b> and finishing <b>periods,</b> and slaughtered at 30 month of age. Results Growing performance was higher (p< 0. 05) in the CON group compared to the TMR group during <b>fattening</b> and finishing <b>periods.</b> The CON group was lower (p< 0. 05) in blood aspartic acid transaminase, blood urea nitrogen and retinol levels during growing period, but higher in triglyceride and cholesterol levels during <b>fattening</b> and finishing <b>periods</b> compared to the TMR group. The CON group was greater (p< 0. 05) in rib-eye area, and lighter (p< 0. 05) red in meat color compared to the TMR group. In the correlation coefficients between blood components of steers and carcass traits, retinol had a negative (p< 0. 05) correlation with marbling score and rib-eye area. Leptin had a positive (p< 0. 05) correlation with back fat thickness. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride were positively (p< 0. 05) correlated with carcass weight and rib-eye area. Conclusion Growth performance, carcass ribeye area and meat color showed a more desirable result in the CON compared to the TMR in Hanwoo steers. Assessing the accumulated data of carcass traits with blood components including hormones—particularly retinol, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin—during the fattening or finishing phases, {{it may be possible to}} find a biomarker for determining beef quality in living animals...|$|R

The experiment lasted four months, January, February, March, and April. Nine animals were used and divided into three separate lots. Lot 1 consisted of two cows and a yearling steer; lot 2 consisted of two cows and a yearling steer. These two lots were as near alike as could be selected. Lot 3 consisted of a three year old bull, an aged cow and a yearling steer. The cows in lots 1 and 2 were bred before the trial begun, so as to ascertain whether there is anything in new process oil meal that would interfere with the health of cows {{during the period of}} gestation. Lot 1 was fed during January and February on old process meal and during March and April on new process meal. Lot 2 was fed during January and February new process meal, and during March and April on old process meal. Lot 3 was fed as lot 1, was—old process for two months and then new process for two months. The total gains made by the nine cattle while eating old process meal were 697 pounds, and the total gains made by them when eating new process meal were 783 pounds. Lot 1 gained 295 pounds on the old process meal and 328 on the new process meal. Lot 2 gained 244 on the old process meal and 201 on the new process meal. Lot 3 gained 158 on the old process meal and 254 on the new process meal. The average daily gain of each of the nine cattle was 1. 36 pounds...|$|R
40|$|According to Chapter 1 oft the GlHV, dated December 3 rd, 1997 feedlots of Poultry {{fattening}} {{are required}} to collect Data from the housing conditions of the animals. Taking these fattening data into consideration during official veterinarian Examinations is designed to getting the best possible Information about the flock. Results of the ante mortem examination are to be examined or explained by its origination, {{to be able to}} determine the general health condition of a herd. This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the flock of origin as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between <b>fattening</b> <b>periods,</b> control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between <b>fattening</b> <b>periods</b> - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative pathogenic micro-organism. The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe organic steer production on farm level. Six Danish organic farms were part of the registration program including 3 dairy farmers and 3 crop farmers buying dairy breed bull calves from organic dairy farmers. All farmers had a steer production, some of them were recently started and some had an established steer production. The experiment endured 2 years from January 2000 to April 2002. Registrations included liveweight, feed consumption, welfare and slaughter results with special emphasis on the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Welfare registrations were based on a scheme describing the system as well as the animal during winter when stabled in the barn and during summer on pasture. Registrations were measured on the system as well on the animals. Daily gain on pasture varied from 533 to 823 g and covers grazing on ryegrass/clover pastures as well as marginal grazing areas. On most of the farms steers grazed both kind of pastures. Gains during the stable period varied from 562 to 867 g/day between the farms. Feed consumption per steer per year was 1770 SFU ± 186 based on 4 farms. Feed consumption in summer accounted 0. 47 to 0. 57 of total feed consumption (DM) per year. Pasture accounts for 0. 22 to 0. 56 and concentrates for 0. 16 to 0. 37 of the total dry matter (DM) consumption per year. Management strategies concerning the fattening of steers were different between the 6 farms, as liveweight (458 - 595 kg) and age (20 - 25 months) at start of fattening and at slaughter (565 - 667 kg and 23 - 28 months) and length of <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> (2. 3 - 3. 4 months) varied. Feeding during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> was based on 1. 3 to 4. 7 Scandinavian Feed Units (SFU) concentrates per steer per day and silage ad libitum. The total amount of cereals consumed in the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> was 100 - 357 kg/steer. Only few steers were fattened on pasture. It seemed that whole crop silage is preferred to grass silage in the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Slaughter results show a variation between farms in slaughter percentage from 49. 4 to 53. 8, carcass conformation from 3. 5 to 4. 9 and fatness from 2. 5 to 3. 2. Liveweight at slaughter was the only variable with general effect on carcass conformation on 5 farms (0. 6 point on the EUROP-scale with increase in 100 kg liveweight at slaughter). The welfare registration scheme indicates good conditions both in the barn and on pasture, low disease rate and minor problems concerning welfare aspects in organic steer production. It is concluded that great variation between farms concerning management strategies shows the possibilities for improving the production system. Fattening strategy should focus on liveweight at slaughter. Length of <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> as well as daily gain during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> in the range practiced on the farms seemed to be of minor importance with regard to carcass conformation...|$|E

This approach affected the spectrum gain as the linear band shifting took place. The measured sensitivity of the long period fiber gratings were about 72 pm/°C in a range from 25 to 500 °C. Here, the temperature rate of the experiment was 0. 17 °C/s and the temperature response time was within 3 s.

40|$|Evaporation {{of water}} to the ambient air is {{generally}} a cost-effective solution to alleviate heat stress but is also critically discussed due to its increasing effect on indoor humidity The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the impact on indoor temperature, humidity, and ventilation rate using a high-pressure fogging system inside a mechanically ventilated research facility for fattening pigs. Data were sampled quasi-continuously throughout four <b>fattening</b> <b>periods,</b> including information on water consumption and energy use of the fogging system, {{as well as on the}} average weight gain of the pigs. It was found that for the pigs, the positive effects of the reduction of sensible indoor temperature exceeded the negative effects of the increased humidity, mirrored e. g. by a reduction of the temperature-humidity index (alert situations were reduced from 15. 5 % to 0. 8 %) and an increased weight gain of the animals during hot summer conditions. Main effects were achieved on days with mean daily outside temperatures above 14 degrees C, during which water consumption of the fogging system averaged 4. 91 d(- 1) pig(- 1). The evaporation characteristics, such as the evaporative fraction as well as the time constant for reaching a steady state, were evaluated using a transfer-function model. Both were influenced largely by temperature and saturation deficit. While the evaporative fraction was 100 % during steady state and 63 % of steady state was reached within 65 s during warm and dry ambient conditions (28 degrees C; 53 % relative humidity RH), the evaporative fraction dropped to 89 % and 65 % for moderate (21 degrees C; 69 % RH) and cold/humid (13 degrees C; 83 % RH) indoor conditions, respectively, and the time to reach steady state was nearly doubled for the latter. The information about such evaporation characteristics is crucial for an accurate control of fogging and ventilation. (c) 2007 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An F 2 {{cross between}} Duroc and Large White pigs {{was carried out}} in order to detect {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) for 11 meat quality traits (L*, a* and b* Minolta coordinates and water-holding capacity (WHC) of two ham muscles, ultimate pH of two ham and one loin muscles), 13 production traits (birth weight, average daily gain during post-weaning and <b>fattening</b> <b>periods,</b> carcass fat depths at three locations, estimated lean meat content, carcass length and weights of five carcass cuts) and three stress hormone-level traits (cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline). Animals from the three generations of the experimental design (including 456 F 2 pigs) were genotyped for 91 microsatellite markers covering all the autosomes. A total of 56 QTL were detected: 49 reached the chromosome-wide level (suggestive QTL with a maximal probability of 0. 05) and seven were significant at the genome-wide level (with a probability varying from 631024 to 331023). Twenty suggestive QTL were identified for ultimate pH, colour measurements and WHC on chromosome (SSC) 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 17. For production traits, 33 QTL were detected on all autosomes except SSC 6, 8 and 9. Seven of these QTL, located on SSC 2, 3, 10, 13, 16 and 17, exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold. Finally, three QTL were identified for levels of stress hormones: a QTL for cortisol level on SSC 7 in the cortisol-binding globulin gene region, a QTL for adrenaline level on SSC 10 and a QTL for noradrenaline level on SSC 13. Among all the detected QTL, seven are described for the first time: a QTL for ultimate pH measurement on SSC 5, two QTL affecting birth weight on SSC 2 and 10, two QTL for growth rate on SSC 15 (during fattening) and 17 (during post-weaning) and two QTL affecting the adrenaline and noradrenaline levels. For each QTL, only one to five of the six F 1 sires were found to be heterozygous. It means that all QTL are segregating in {{at least one of the}} founder populations used in this study. These results suggest that both meat quality and production traits can be improved in purebred Duroc and Large White pigs through markerassisted selection. It is of particular interest for meat quality traits, which are difficult to include in classical selection programmes...|$|R
