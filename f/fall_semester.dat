40|$|This paper {{examines}} student {{unrest and}} campus culture {{during the spring}} and <b>fall</b> <b>semesters</b> of 1970 at Wisconsin State University-Eau Claire (presently the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire). Throughout the Vietnam War era, college students protested {{the war and the}} rise of U. S. militarism. Near the end of the 1960 s and into the early 1970 s, student protest on some of the nation’s campuses became increasingly violent. In the spring and <b>fall</b> <b>semesters</b> of 1970, for example, events on the campuses of Kent State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison proved fatal. In a historical context, deadly protest characterized many universities’ 1970 spring and <b>fall</b> <b>semesters.</b> Conversely, the WSU-Eau Claire campus remained non-violent. This paper addresses the anti-war movement at the university level and details the main reasons WSU-Eau Claire maintained peace in a time of turmoi...|$|R

5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the <b>fall</b> <b>semester</b> of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (<b>Fall</b> <b>Semester,</b> 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
