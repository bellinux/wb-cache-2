5|$|In 1573 he was rector of the Wilno Jesuit College, {{precursor}} to the Wilno Academy (Vilnius University). In 1577 he became {{a professor at the}} Kraków Academy.

In 1579 he became the first rector of the Wilno Academy.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Biden became ranking {{minority}} {{member of}} the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981. In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, and it was <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> legislative accomplishment {{at that point in}} time. He first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted {{that there is no}} restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> opinion.|$|E
5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis {{considered}} this <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> work– {{the subject was}} his central interest and he regarded much of his previous work as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, {{went out of business}} shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote some of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E

50|$|Another {{major source}} of {{inspiration}} was il Risorgimento. In 1859 he published A Vittorio Emanuele II, celebrating Victor Emmanuel II, and one of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>importants</b> poems, the 1018 verse Giuseppe Garibaldi (episodio della guerra per l’indipendenza italiana), first published in 1927, contributed in an original way {{to the creation of}} the Garibaldian myth. Not least of his achievements in this area was the composition of a version of Camicia rossa Garibaldina for which he was personally thanked by Garibaldi himself.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pioneering}} Irish architects was Sir Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733), who {{became one of the}} leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir John Vanbrugh, he was originally one of his pupils, but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in France and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> Palladian work is the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of Drumcondra House in 1727 and Cashel Palace in 1728.|$|E
5|$|Priestley wrote <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{philosophical}} works {{during his}} years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|The 17th century {{mathematician}} Kamalakara, was a forward-looking astronomer-mathematician {{who studied}} Hindu, Greek and Arabic astronomy. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> work was the Siddhanta-Tattvaviveka. He studied and agreed with Ptolemaic {{notions of the}} planetary systems. He {{was the first and}} the only traditional astronomer to present geometrical optics. Kamalakara proposed a new Prime Meridian which passed through the imaginary city of Khaladatta, and provided a table of latitudes and longitudes for 24 cities within and outside of India.|$|E

5|$|The British {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} group's principal investigations concerned {{immunological tolerance}} (the body's acceptance of tissues, {{as opposed to}} rejection), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked {{with the use of}} immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Vilhelm Dahlerup {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} 19th-century architects. Perhaps more than anyone else, he contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> buildings include Copenhagen's Hotel D’Angleterre (1875) and the Danish National Gallery (1891). With the support of the Carlsberg company, he designed the Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteque (1897) and a number of lavishly decorated buildings at the Carlsberg Brewery site, now under redevelopment as a new district in Copenhagen.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{had his own}} {{opera house}} built, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which {{embodied}} many novel design features. The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival, run by his descendants. His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again, and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works, including Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg).|$|E
5|$|When the House {{convened in}} December 1849, a member from Mercer County {{nominated}} Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs. After receiving 39 votes—8 {{short of a}} majority—on the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic floor leader during the session. Davis wrote that <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> work during the session was bank reform.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E
