[...] It was Maryland's fifth {{consecutive}} defeat of a ranked opponent, {{and the third}} of the season, making them 3–0 against ranked opponents, but just 2–2 against all others. The game also {{marked the first time}} that Wake Forest had been held scoreless in 124games when it lost to Air Force in 1998, {{and it was the first}} time since 1957 that the Terrapins had bounced back to shut out an opponent following a shutout of their own. The last Maryland shutout of a ranked opponent was in 1955 against UCLA.|$|E
500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>by</b> the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Kilmers' {{daughter}} Rose (1912–1917) was {{stricken with}} poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, {{they turned to}} their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Father James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Roman Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters Kilmer writes that he [...] "believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time," [...] and he [...] "wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith." [...] Kilmer would stop [...] "every morning for months" [...] on his way [...] "to the office and prayed for faith," [...] claiming that when [...] "faith did come, it came, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>by</b> way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think her tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and {{it gives me a}} selfish pleasure to write it down." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics, with some arguing that Spears' body was digitally altered. The Daily Telegraph commented [...] "Britney – presumably {{with the help}} of some serious digital remastering – has turned back the clock, looking every part the young starlet that gave us 'Oops'". Dose said [...] "shockingly, it's not that bad. Well, not that bad for everyone's favourite panty protesting, deposition skipping, weave wearing pop-tard". On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories. On October 18, 2008, during a live interview with New York's Z100, she explained that she was shocked when she won, saying, [...] "It's a cool video, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>by</b> far I've done videos that are way better, so I was really shocked that it got [...] It was just inspiring, though, because now, going forward with the videos that I'm doing now, I can really go there and do something crazy and see what happens".|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>by</b> the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard and the Church of Scientology {{presented}} {{a number of}} different accounts of his time in the western Pacific. In 1963, Hubbard told Australian journalists that he had been [...] "the only anti-aircraft battery in Australia in 1941–42... There was me and a Thompson submachine gun... I was a mail officer and I was replaced, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>by</b> a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers." [...] Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been [...] "one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas" [...] and that he had [...] "sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the gunwales with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and quinine up to MacArthur." [...] When [...] "Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so I went home. I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US." [...] According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was landed on the island of Java [...] "in the closing days of February 1942" [...] to search for [...] "stockpiled weapons and fast, shallow-draft vessels." [...] He was cut off by invading Japanese [...] "and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer." [...] Another Church of Scientology account describes Hubbard as [...] "Senior Officer Present Ashore in Brisbane, Australia" [...] and asserts that [...] "his duties included counter-intelligence and the organization of relief for beleaguered American forces on Bataan. It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft. In a 1956 lecture to Scientologists, Hubbard said: ...|$|E

"Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>by</b> muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee echoed his {{statement}} {{when he appeared}} on Face the Nation {{on the morning of}} August 12. [...] "We're in fact in the first tier, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>by</b> everybody's estimation, and here's why," [...] Huckabee told Jim Axelrod. [...] "It wasn't just that we surprised people with a second showing, it's that we did it with so few resources. I mean, this really was feeding the 5,000 with two fish and five loaves, an amazing kind of day for us." [...] Looking beyond Iowa, former Governor of South Carolina and Huckabee supporter David Beasley said that Huckabee is filling the void created by the lack of a social conservative in the race. He said that [...] "I really believe now that the conservative voters will begin to coalesce behind Mike Huckabee...and it's going to be infectious in New Hampshire and South Carolina" ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] {{knew that}} we were looking to do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few years}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>by</b> talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E
