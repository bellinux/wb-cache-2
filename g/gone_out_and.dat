500|$|He recounted {{his career}} as a thief, {{confirming}} Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned. [...] "The big payoff for me," [...] he said, [...] "was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> taken." [...] Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to [...] "totally possess" [...] his victims. At first, he killed his victims [...] "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [...] caught"; but later, murder became part of the [...] "adventure". [...] "The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. [...] "And then ... the physical possession of the remains." ...|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Caral Stromgren, Sechelts [...] "regular" [...] captain {{stated that}} he had been ill, so Captain James had {{relieved}} him. (Jarvis testified later that he and James had fired Stromgren, apparently related to his unawareness that he had lost a propeller blade and the possibility it posed for damage to the ship.) In any case, Stromgren had wanted to talk with Captain James on 24 March, so he went down to the Grand Trunk Pacific dock, where he found that Sechelt had been shifted over to Canadian Pacific Railway dock. It was blowing hard and raining, so he did not think Sechelt would go out, so he decided to speak with Captain James later. He did not learn until the next day that Sechelt had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> been lost. Had he been in command he would never had taken her out. With some exceptions, he considered Sechelt to have been in good condition.|$|E

He sat down and played the {{bottleneck}} guitar. We’d been pushing him for years to do it and finally he just got loose enough and comfortable enough with the audience there at the Fillmore to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> sat down {{on the stage}} — it was Valentine’s Day and he had a honey out in the crowd. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> played ‘Katie Mae’ to her. Immediately following that, Bobby (Weir) <b>and</b> Garcia <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> did the same thing. They sat down and played acoustic guitars. They don’t do that anymore." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Judah {{approached}} Joseph, whom he likened to Pharaoh, and recounted how Joseph {{had asked the}} 10 brothers whether they had a father or brother, and they {{had told him that}} they had a father who was an old man (Jacob), and a child of his old age who was a little one (Benjamin), whose brother was dead, who alone was left of his mother (Rachel), and whose father loved him. Judah recalled how Joseph had told the brothers to bring their younger brother down to Egypt, they had told Joseph that the lad's leaving would kill his father, but Joseph had insisted. Judah recalled how the brothers had told their father Joseph's words, and when their father had told them to go again to buy a little food, they had reminded him that they could not go down without their youngest brother. Judah recounted how their father had told them that his wife had born him two sons, one had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> was torn in pieces, and if they took the youngest and harm befell him, it would bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Judah began to explain to Joseph what would happen if Judah were to come to his father without the lad, seeing that his father's soul was bound up with the lad's. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
