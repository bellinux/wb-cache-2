40|$|Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{mainly caused by}} mutations in the LDLR gene, resulting in elevated serum cholesterol levels and elevated risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Timely treatment with lipid lowering medication can {{lower the risk of}} CVD to the same level of the normal population. Currently the incidence of FH is estimated at 1 in 240 persons in the Caucasian population. A diagnosis of FH can be {{made on the basis of}} clinical criteria (including LDL cholesterol and family history) or DNA testing. When a mutation is known within a family an unequivocal diagnosis can be made by DNA testing in family members at any age. Genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is a cost-effective way to identify patients and prevent CVD. Between 1994 until 2014 a nationwide and government subsidized <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program functioned to identify FH patients in the Netherlands. During this time more than 28, 000 patients with FH have been identified and entered in a central, national database. Since 2014 <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> has been integrated in the regular Dutch health care system. Screening, counseling and treatment are now integrated in the care as a whole of FH patients and families, coordinated by the treating physician, while the national FH database is still maintained. However, since <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> by actively approaching family members cannot be applied anymore because of new regulations within the healthcare system, the number of family members participating in the <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program, has plummeted. With this review we would like to highlight the practical consequences of implementing and executing a <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program with a special focus on the lessons learned in the Netherlands.

40|$|Objectives: {{to compare}} the effectiveness, {{estimate}} the associated costs, and summarise available evidence about the feasibility and acceptability of different screening strategies in England and Wales. Also to establish a model for estimating effectiveness and costs of these different strategies. Data sources: literature searches were restricted to MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as citations in included papers. A broad search strategy was used involving all aspects of fragile X syndrome (FXS) and covered all relevant literature published between 1991 and 2001. Review methods: an assessment was conducted of published literature and efforts focused {{on the development of}} a model {{that could be used to}} synthesise data from various sources, estimate cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and conduct sensitivity analyses according to different assumptions. Results: the identified screening programmes were effective in detecting carriers, but a comparison of different strategies was not possible. Simulation results by the FXS Model showed that, over the first 10 years, 4 % of premutation (PM) females and 70 % of full mutation (FM) females could be detected by active cascade screening; it is 10 % and 58 %, respectively, by prenatal screening. The maximal detection rate for FM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is higher than that by prenatal screening (91 % versus 71 %). However, the maximal rate of detection of female PM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> (6 %) is much lower than that by prenatal screening (60 %). During the first 10 years of simulation, the estimated direct cost per year to the NHS in England and Wales is 0. 7 - 0. 2 million pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 14. 5 - 9. 1 million pounds sterling by a programme of prenatal screening. The incremental cost per extra carrier detected (using current practice as the reference standard) is on average only 165 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 7543 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. The incremental cost per FXS birth avoided is on average 8494 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 284, 779 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. Conclusions: the empirical evidence suggests that both prenatal <b>screening</b> and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> are feasible and acceptable. Population-based prenatal screening is more efficacious, but it will cost more than active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> The active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> of affected families is more efficient, cheaper, but less effective than a population-based prenatal screening. It is suggested that both strategies be evaluated in large-scale trials, which might also help to determine whether and how the different strategies could be simultaneously or sequentially combine...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cascade</b> testing or <b>screening</b> {{provides}} an important mechanism for identifying {{people at risk}} of a genetic condition. For some autosomal dominant conditions, such as Familial Hpercholesterolaemia (FH), identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can extend a person’s life expectancy significantly. However, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is not without ethical implications. In this paper, we examine one ethically contentious aspect of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programmes, namely the alternative methods by which relatives of a proband can be contacted. Should the proband be responsible for contacting {{his or her family}} members, or should the screening programme contact family members directly? We argue that direct contact is an ethically justifiable method of contact tracing in <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for FH. Not only has this method of contact already been utilised without adverse effects, an examination of the ethical arguments against it shows these are unsubstantiated. We describe several criteria which, if met, will allow an appropriate balance to be struck between maximising the efficiency of family tracing and respecting the interests of probands and their relatives.

40|$|Screening {{for genetic}} {{variants}} that predispose individuals or their offspring to disease may be {{performed at the}} general population level or may instead be targeted at the relatives of previously identified carriers. The latter strategy {{has come to be}} known as “cascade genetic screening. ” Since the carrier risk of close relatives of known carriers is generally higher than the population risk, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is more efficient than population screening, in the sense that fewer individuals have to be genotyped per detected carrier. The efficacy of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> as measured by the overall proportion of carriers detected in a given population, is, however, lower than that of population-wide screening, and the respective inclusion rates vary according to the population frequency and mode of inheritance of the predisposing variants. For dominant mutations, we have developed equations that allow the inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For recessive mutations, we derived only equations for the screening of siblings and the children of patients. Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> turned out to result in low inclusion rates (< 1 %) when aimed at the identification of heterozygous carriers of rare recessive variants. Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect covert homozygotes for frequent recessive mutations with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by hereditary hemochromatosis, for which up to 40 % of at-risk individuals may be identifiable through screening of first- to third-degree relatives of overt carriers (i. e., patients); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be ∼ 50 times higher than that of population-wide screening. For dominant mutations, inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> were estimated to be higher than for recessive variants. Thus, some 80 % of all carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at first- to third-degree relatives of patients with venous thrombosis. The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with population-wide screening (i. e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for dominant than for recessive mutations. This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the population level, it can be expected that <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> would only transiently represent an economically viable option...|$|R

This study investigated index patients' experiences of DNA testing and mediating <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> Thirty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of definite or possible FH who had undergone DNA testing in the lipid clinic took part in semi-structured qualitative interviews. All patients were positive about DNA screening being undertaken by familiar and trusted clinicians within the lipid clinic. Most patients had already cascaded close relatives for serum cholesterol testing following their attendance at the lipid clinic. Identified mutation carriers who had attended the genetics clinic (n[*]=[*] 15) for a cascading appointment described finding this consultation helpful because it identified other at-risk family members and provided them with tailored information for their relatives. Participants who expressed a preference said they favoured indirect (patient-mediated) methods of cascading as they considered indirect approaches to be less threatening to family members than direct clinical contact. We conclude that DNA screening and indirect familial cascading is perceived as highly acceptable to index patients with FH. However, while indirect cascading methods may be more acceptable to patients, they do not yield the same numbers as more direct methods. There is, therefore, a need for further systematic research to investigate patients', family members' and staff views of the acceptability of direct versus indirect methods of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening...</b>|$|R

SUBJECTS [...] Relatives and partners of 607 people with cystic fibrosis. INTERVENTIONS [...] Genetic counselling by letter for people found to be carriers; formal genetic counselling and when indicated arrangements for prenatal diagnosis for couples discovered to be carriers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of carrier couples detected; action in pregnancy of detected carrier couples; extent of the uptake of screening by relatives. RESULTS [...] Of 1563 relatives or partners tested, 15 carrier couples were detected; of nine pregnancies undertaken by these 15, eight had prenatal tests and three terminated pregnancies. An average of 16 people per family have come forward for testing so far. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for carriers of cystic fibrosis is well accepted by relatives, especially on the mother's side of the family; it is 10 times more efficient in detecting carrier couples than unfocused screening.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: Patients with {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia (FH) have elevated LDL-C levels, usually above the 90 th percentile (P 90) for age and gender. However, large scale genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for FH showed that 15 % of the LDL-receptor (LDLR) or Apolipoprotein B (APOB) mutation carriers have LDL-C levels below P 75. Non-pathogenicity of sequence changes may explain this phenomenon.

Study design Questionnaires covering topics such as demographics, family history, physician consultation, and treatment were sent to parents of patients with FH (age 0 - 18 years), 18 months after diagnosis. Results We retrieved 207 questionnaires of patients aged 10. 9 +/- 4. 2 years (mean +/- SD) at diagnosis; 48 % were boys, and the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at diagnosis was 167 +/- 51 mg/dL. Of these patients, 164 (79 %) consulted a physician: a general practitioner (35 %), lipid-clinic specialist (27 %), pediatrician (21 %), internist (11 %), or another physician (6 %). LDL-C level at diagnosis and a positive family history for cardiovascular disease were independent predictors for physician consultation. Of the patients who visited a physician, 62 % reported to have received lifestyle advice, and 43 (26 %) were prescribed statin treatment. Independent predictors for medication use were age, LDL-C level, and educational level of parents.

40|$|Background: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is {{a serious}} genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in every 300 to 500 individuals and is characterised by excessively high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, substantially increased risk of early-onset coronary heart disease (CHD) and premature mortality. If FH is untreated, it leads to a greater than 50 % risk of CHD in men {{by the age of}} 50 and at least 30 % in women by the age of 60. FH can be diagnosed through genetic screening and effectively managed through pharmacological treatment and lifestyle changes. Purpose: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic health condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although FH can be effectively managed with appropriate pharmacological and dietary interventions, FH detection rate through genetic screening remains low. The present study explored perceptions and experiences of FH patients (N = 18) involved in a genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programme. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess patients’ knowledge and understanding of FH, explore factors linked to adherence to health-protective behaviours and examine perceptions of genetic screening. Results: Thematic analysis of interviews revealed four themes: disease knowledge, severity of FH, lifestyle behavioural change and barriers to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and treatment. Participants recognised FH as a permanent, genetic condition that increased their risk of CHD and premature mortality. Many participants dismissed the seriousness of FH and the importance of lifestyle changes because they perceived it to be effectively managed through medication. Despite positive attitudes toward screening, many participants reported that relatives were reluctant to attend screening due to their relatives’ ‘fatalistic’ outlook or low motivation. Participants believed that they had insufficient authority or control to persuade family members to attend screening and welcomed greater hospital assistance for contact with relatives. Conclusions: Findings support the adoption of direct methods of recruitment to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> led by medical professionals, who were perceived as having greater authority. Other implications included the need for clinicians to provide clear information, particularly to those who are asymptomatic, related to the seriousness of FH and the necessity for adherence to medication and lifestyle changes.

To improve identification of this under-diagnosed disease, experts suggested raising the age limit for CRC tumour genetic testing from 50 to 70 years. The present study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy. METHODS: Probabilistic efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out comparing tumour genetic testing of CRC diagnosed at age 70 or below (experimental strategy) versus CRC diagnosed at age 50 or below (current practice). The proportions of LS patients identified and cost-effectiveness including <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> of relatives, were calculated by decision analytic models based on real-life data. RESULTS: Using the experimental strategy, four times more LS patients can be identified among CRC patients when compared with current practice.

A recent survey commissioned by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported a lack of awareness of FH in the general population. We conducted a survey to assess knowledge among healthcare professionals involved in the assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and disease in the United Kingdom. Methods A survey designed to assess knowledge of diagnostic criteria, risk assessment, the role of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> and management options for patients with FH was distributed to 1000 healthcare professionals (response rate 44. 3 %). The same survey was redistributed following attendance at an educational session on FH. Results 151 respondents (40. 5 %) reported having patients under their care who would meet the diagnostic criteria for FH, but just 61. 4 % recognized that cardiovascular risk estimation tools cannot be applied in FH, and only 22. 3 % understood the relative risk of premature CVD compared to the general population.

METHODS: Descriptive analysis of country data related to FH <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> molecular diagnosis, clinical practice guidelines, and patient organization presence in Ibero-America. RESULTS: From a conservative estimation of an FH prevalence of 1 of 500 individuals, there should be 1. 2 million heterozygous FH individuals in Ibero-America and roughly 27, 400 were diagnosed so far. Only Spain, Brazil, Portugal, and Uruguay have active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programs.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the follow-up and treatment of the mutation-carrying relatives of a proband with an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. BACKGROUND: The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals. After establishing the disease-causing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutation in probands, we actively conducted <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to identify, most often asymptomatic, relatives who are also at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from our cardiogenetics database and patient records and analyzed whether the identified carriers received prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2008, 130 probands with a disease-causing mutation in one of the involved genes were identified, and 509 relatives tested positive for the disease-causing familial mutation. These subjects subsequently underwent cardiologic investigation (electrocardiography, exercise testing, Holter monitoring, ajmaline testing, echocardiography, where appropriate). After a mean follow-up of 69 +/- 31 months (LQTS), 60 +/- 19 months (CPVT), and 56 +/- 21 months (BrS), treatment was initiated and ongoing in 65 % (199 of 308), 71 % (85 of 120), and 6 % (5 of 81) of the relatives in the LQTS, CPVT, and BrS families, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} what proportion {{of cases of}} heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia would be identified by <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> conducted by a specialist hospital clinic, and by how much this would increase the prevalence of diagnosed cases. SETTING: Hospital clinic serving a population of 605, 900 in Oxfordshire, UK. METHODS: A specialist nurse obtained details of living first-degree relatives from 227 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia currently or previously attending Oxford lipid clinic after excluding 79 adults without relatives living in Oxfordshire and 48 children. Index cases were asked to invite relatives resident in Oxfordshire for testing. RESULTS: A total of 227 index cases had 1075 first-degree relatives, including 442 adults and 117 children aged < 18 years resident in Oxfordshire. We excluded 171 previously screened adults and 46 for other reasons. Among 225 eligible adult relatives, 28 responders (12 %) planned to consult their general practitioner and 52 (23 %) attended the clinic for testing. Parents of 113 children (97 %) wanted them tested. The positive diagnostic rate was 29 % (15 / 52) in adults and 32 % (36 / 113) in children. Screening increased prevalence by 14. 4 %, from 0. 58 / 1000 (95 % confidence intervals [CI] 0. 52 - 0. 65) to 0. 67 / 1000 (95 % CI 0. 60 - 0. 73), representing 33. 5 % of predicted cases.

Introduction. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder associated with a severely increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although DNA test results in FH are associated with important medical and ethical consequences, data on accuracy of genetic tests is scarce. Methods. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to assess the overall accuracy of the DNA test used in the genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> program for FH in The Netherlands.

40|$|To {{review the}} current state and {{different}} aspects, including the yield, of genetic counseling and genetic testing in inherited heart disease. The number of counselees is growing rapidly all over the world, and the first studies about patients' perspectives and follow-up have been published. Progress has been made by gene-specific studies on long QT syndrome to judge the relevance of detected mutations in the specific domains. With the increasing identification of associated genes and available techniques in molecular testing of the inherited heart diseases, the diagnostic yield of mutation analysis is growing rapidly. To determine the relevance of all these mutations, ongoing research is needed.

40|$|Background: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) are genetic {{cardiovascular}} diseases that cause sudden cardiac death. When {{an individual is}} diagnosed with an inherited disease such as HCM/LQTS {{it is critical that}} their biological relatives are notified of their increased risk. Newly diagnosed individuals in turn notify other at-risk family members through a successive process called <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> This facilitates screening of at-risk biological relatives through genetic testing and/or clinical testing, and treatment for HCM/LQTS prior to development of life-threatening complications. However, for <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to detect all potential cases the disease risk must be effectively communicated to all at-risk relatives. The responsibility for notifying family members of this risk largely falls to the first person diagnosed in the family (proband). Empiric evidence suggests that around half of at-risk relatives are not screened in accordance with <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> recommendations, potentially due to information about HCM/LQTS risk not being communicated effectively in their families. Factors have been identified that influence communication about genetic risk in families with non-cardiac disease; however, it is not known if or how these factors apply in families with genetic cardiac disease. These include network factors, which describe characteristics of relationships between family members and non-network factors, which describe characteristics of individuals including individual factors, disease factors, and sociocultural factors. There is a critical need to understand communication in families with HCM/LQTS in order to facilitate effective genetic risk communication in families, improve adherence to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> recommendations, and prevent death and complications from {{cardiovascular diseases}}. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to improve our understanding of the relationships among network and non-network factors and communication of genetic risk for HCM/LQTS between probands and their relatives. I proposed the following aims: Aim 1 : Describe family social network structures and communication paths about risk for HCM/LQTS from probands to their relatives. Aim 2 : Identify which network and non-network factors are associated with who is told about risk for HCM/LQTS. Methods: The sample for this study included individuals with HCM or LQTS recruited through the University of Iowa Cardiology Clinics (UI) and the University of Wisconsin Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic (UW). Data were collected using a structured interview, family pedigree, and survey. Analysis included egocentric social network analysis, descriptive, bivariate, and multilevel logit regression modeling. Results: Participants in this study had an average of 24 living at-risk relatives in their families. Overall, just over half (52 %) of these at-risk relatives had been reported to have been told about their risk. However, within families, the percentage of relatives told about their risk ranged from 0 %- 100 %. Ninety percent of first-degree relatives were told about their risk, 61 % of second-degree relatives were told and 33 % of third-degree relatives were told. Recruitment site affiliation was determined to be a confounder and so analyses were calculated separately for UI and UW. In both the UI and UW samples, network factors including closer geographic distance, increased emotional closeness, increased relationship quality, increased frequency of communication, higher betweenness centrality, and closer degree of biological relation were independently associated with increased odds of communication of risk. In the UI sample, non-network factors that were independently associated with increased odds of communication of risk included younger age at diagnosis; having LQTS; having positive genetic test results; having an ICD; younger current age; being female; having increased role limitations due to physical functioning; feeling anxious about telling family members about risk; feeling communication was a burden; feeling that communication was a responsibility or duty; being happy to be able to share important information; and identifying financial issues, pregnancies, or upcoming marriages as playing a role in communication. In a multivariate model, increased frequency of communication, closer degree of biological relation, having an ICD, and identifying financial issues and pregnancies as contributors to communication were significantly associated with communication of genetic risk information. In the UW sample, non-network factors that were independently associated with increased odds of communication of risk included younger age, decreased emotional wellbeing, increased role limitations due to emotional wellbeing, and decreased energy and fatigue. In a multivariate model, increased frequency of communication and closer degree of biological relation were significantly associated with communication. Although over half of at-risk relatives were told about their risk, just over half of those (53. 8 %) were reported to have screened for disease, which represents 27 % of all at-risk relatives. Of those tested, 35 % were reported as diagnosed with HCM/LQTS. Conclusion: Communication of genetic risk for HCM/LQTS in families is inadequate and contributes to the problem of relatives not being screened for disease. Insight on the factors that influence communication in families at risk of sudden cardiac death can guide development of interventions, policies, and future research aimed at improving genetic risk communication and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> and preventing death and complications from inherited cardiac diseases. This research is applicable for genetic conditions where population based screening methods are not effective and rely on families to communicate risk and need for screening...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} what proportion {{of cases of}} heterozygous familial hypercholesteroloemia would be identified by <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> conducted by a specialist hospital clinic, and by how much this would increase the prevalence of diagnosed cases.

Thus, natural antioxidant carotenoids existing in fruits and vegetables could have {{a significant role in}} the prevention of CVD. Nevertheless,clinical data are conflicting about the positive effect of some antioxidant carotenoids in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many biological actions of carotenoids have been attributed to their antioxidant effect; however, the precise mechanism by which carotenoids produce their beneficial effects is still under discussion. They might modulate molecular pathways involved in cell proliferation, acting at Akt, tyrosine kinases, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and growth factor signaling <b>cascades.</b> <b>Screening</b> for a promising cardiovascular protective carotenoids therefore might be performed in vitro and in vivo with caution in cross-interaction with other molecules involved in signaling pathways especially those affecting microRNAs, performing a role in molecular modulation of cardiovascular cells...|$|R

Methods: A 45 years old woman was referred to the clinical genetics department by her psychiatrist for investigation of her gross obesity, hyperphagia, learning difficulties and affective disorder. Results: Cytogenetic analysis revealed a 47,XXX karyotype. Molecular testing identified an expansion of approximately 580 repeats in the FRAXA gene carried on two of her three copies of the X chromosome. Clinical evaluation revealed features consistent with the Prader-Willi like phenotype of Fragile X syndrome.
