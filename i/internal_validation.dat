40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence {{that exposure to}} vehicular traffic increases the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and may exacerbate pre-existing asthma in children. Self-reported exposure to road traffic has been questioned as a reliable measurement of exposure to air pollutants. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether there were specific effects of cars and trucks traffic on current asthma symptoms (i. e. wheezing) and cough or phlegm, and to examine the validity of self-reported traffic exposure. Methods The survey was conducted in 2002 in 12 centers in Northern, Center and Southern Italy, different in size, climate, latitude and level of urbanization. Standardized questionnaires filled in by parents were used to collect information on health outcomes and exposure to traffic among 33, 632 6 – 7 and 13 – 14 years old children and adolescents. Three questions on traffic exposure were asked: the traffic in the zone of residence, the frequency of truck and of car traffic in the street of residence. The presence of a possible response bias for the self-reported traffic was evaluated using external validation (comparison with measurements of traffic flow in the city of Turin) and <b>internal</b> <b>validations</b> (matching by census block, in the cities of Turin, Milan and Rome). Results Overall traffic density was weakly associated with asthma symptoms but there was a stronger association with cough or phlegm (high traffic density OR = 1. 24; 95 % CI: 1. 04, 1. 49). Car and truck traffic were independently associated with cough or phlegm. The results of the external validation did not support the existence of a reporting bias for the observed associations, for all the self-reported traffic indicators examined. The <b>internal</b> <b>validations</b> showed that the observed association between traffic density in the zone of residence and respiratory symptoms did not appear to be explained by an over reporting of traffic by parents of symptomatic subjects. Conclusion Children living in zones with intense traffic are at higher risk for respiratory effects. Since population characteristics are specific, the results of validation of studies on self-reported traffic exposure can not be generalized. </p...|$|R

50|$|Scales and indexes {{have to be}} validated. <b>Internal</b> <b>validation</b> {{checks the}} {{relation}} between the individual measures included in the scale, and the composite scale itself. External validation checks {{the relation between the}} composite scale and other indicators of the variable, indicators not included in the scale. Content validation (also called face validity) checks how well the scale measures what is supposed to measured. Criterion validation checks how meaningful the scale criteria are relative to other possible criteria. Construct validation checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity. They are convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity (Campbell and Fiske, 1959; Krus and Ney, 1978). The coefficient of reproducibility indicates how well the data from the individual measures included in the scale can be reconstructed from the composite scale.|$|E
5000|$|Crocker's {{research}} also includes applications for her hypothesis on self-esteem and contingencies of self-worth. This research addresses depressive symptoms {{and alcohol use}} in college students and the correlation (if any) between the negative behavior and one's self-esteem. The first application is a study on depression in which first-year college students were given assessments during new student orientation and then again during second semester. This study showed that students who pursued self-esteem based on external contingencies (appearance, competition, and the approval of others) showed a significantly higher probability of developing symptoms of depression. According to the research found in this study, low self-esteem is most likely not the cause, but yet a very important symptom relating to the depressive symptoms of college freshmen. A second application of self-esteem gave promising results to pursuing self-esteem, although most of Crocker's research emphasizes the costs to pursuit of self-esteem. Crocker's study of the alcohol use of students uncovered that low self-esteem is not a predictor of alcohol use, but contingencies of self-worth correlated with <b>internal</b> <b>validation</b> (family support, virtue, and religious faith) did predict drinking behavior This shows {{that some of the}} contingencies common with the pursuit of self-esteem influence drinking, but levels of self-esteem itself does not. More recently, her research has looked into egosystem and ecosystem goals and their effects on goal achievement, support, responsiveness, and mental health including stress, anxiety, and depression. Egosystem goals are when people only focus on their own needs and desires and ecosystem goals are when people realize they have a connection with others. Crocker found that having an ecosystem could improve relations between different groups. Intergroup relationships are challenging because of the different social identities, but having ecosystem goals can greatly improve these relations. Egosystem goals can cause destructive interactions, while ecosystem goals can create positive relations because they support, understand, and care for them and have better communication skills [...] Her current research seeks to examine how interpersonal goals shape physiological processes and how they affect other people. She is also studying the effects of interpersonal goals for cross-race relationships.|$|E

40|$|Although {{validation}} of classification and prediction models {{has been a}} long-standing topic in Statistics and computer learning, the concept of statistical validation in genome-wide screening studies has been vague. <b>Internal</b> <b>validation</b> generally refers to validation procedures solely based on the study dataset.

40|$|Abstract Background Missing {{values are}} a {{frequent}} issue in human studies. In many situations, multiple imputation (MI) {{is an appropriate}} missing data handling strategy, whereby missing values are imputed multiple times, the analysis is performed in every imputed data set, and the obtained estimates are pooled. If {{the aim is to}} estimate (added) predictive performance measures, such as (change in) the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), <b>internal</b> <b>validation</b> strategies become desirable in order to correct for optimism. It is not fully understood how <b>internal</b> <b>validation</b> should be combined with multiple imputation. Methods In a comprehensive simulation study and in a real data set based on blood markers as predictors for mortality, we compare three combination strategies: Val-MI, <b>internal</b> <b>validation</b> followed by MI on the training and test parts separately, MI-Val, MI on the full data set followed by <b>internal</b> <b>validation,</b> and MI(-y) -Val, MI on the full data set omitting the outcome followed by <b>internal</b> <b>validation.</b> Different validation strategies, including bootstrap und cross-validation, different (added) performance measures, and various data characteristics are considered, and the strategies are evaluated with regard to bias and mean squared error of the obtained performance estimates. In addition, we elaborate on the number of resamples and imputations to be used, and adopt a strategy for confidence interval construction to incomplete data. Results <b>Internal</b> <b>validation</b> is essential in order to avoid optimism, with the bootstrap 0. 632 + estimate representing a reliable method to correct for optimism. While estimates obtained by MI-Val are optimistically biased, those obtained by MI(-y) -Val tend to be pessimistic {{in the presence of a}} true underlying effect. Val-MI provides largely unbiased estimates, with a slight pessimistic bias with increasing true effect size, number of covariates and decreasing sample size. In Val-MI, accuracy of the estimate is more strongly improved by increasing the number of bootstrap draws rather than the number of imputations. With a simple integrated approach, valid confidence intervals for performance estimates can be obtained. Conclusions When prognostic models are developed on incomplete data, Val-MI represents a valid strategy to obtain estimates of predictive performance measures...|$|E
