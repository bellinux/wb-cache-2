40|$|O mal é uma realidade que sempre causou comoção e perplexidade na humanidade. Diante dele, muitos e diversos sistemas de sentido foram criados pelas sociedades a fim de fazer frente aos questionamentos que o absurdo dos sofrimentos físicos e morais trazem para a consciência humana. A fé cristã defende que a salvação definitiva do mal encontra-se em Jesus Cristo, o revelador definitivo da presença divina junto ao ser humano que busca uma saída para as contradições da existência. Porém, apesar da esperança despertada pela páscoa de Jesus Cristo, e mesmo diante das expectativas das primeiras comunidades cristãs quanto ao fim iminente dos sofrimentos deste mundo, o mal persiste como realidade fria e cruel. Como conciliar a fé em Jesus Cristo como Salvador {{universal}} e a persistência da realidade do mal na história? Para o teólogo espanhol Andrés Torres Queiruga, qualquer tentativa de resposta cristã a esta pergunta deve ser fiel ao rosto amoroso do Deus revelado por Jesus Cristo. Porém, não pode desprezar também outros dois fatores: o primeiro, o advento da modernidade, com a sua consciência de autonomia do ser humano e do cosmos, e que desconfia de toda e qualquer defesa de intervenções empíricas de Deus na realidade imanente; o segundo, o rigor do conceito, ou seja, uma reflexão que seja incansável na busca de uma lógica do discurso, mesmo se tratando de um assunto tão difícil, evitando atribuir rapidamente ao mistério aquilo que é fruto da incoerência ou da insuficiência da reflexão. The Evil is {{a reality}} which has always caused shock and astonishment to people. According to it, several different sense systems have been created by society in order {{to answer questions about}} physical and moral damages that are brought to human consciousness. The Christian faith holds that the ultimate salvation from Evil is in Jesus Christ, the definitve revelation of God’s presence with the human being who seeks {{a way out of the}} contradictions of existence. However, despite the hope awaken by the easter of Jesus Christ, and even with the expectations of the earliest Christian communities <b>about</b> <b>the</b> imminent end the suffering of this world, the Evil remains as a cold and cruel reality. How to deal with teh faith in Jesus Christ as the universal savior and the persistence of the Evil in history? According to the Spanish theologian Andrés Torres Queiruga, any attempt to the Christian answer to this question must be similar to the loving face of God revealed by Jesus Christ. But, we cannot <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two facts: first, the rising of modernity, with its consciousness of human autonomy and the cosmos, and that it is suspicious of any defense of empirical interventions of God immanent in reality; the second one; the rigor of the concept, this way we have a reflection that is restless in the search of a logical discourse, even when it is related to a so difficult subject, avoiding sticking to the result of the inconherence and failed consideration of the mistery quickly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of Song Chunfang (1892 - 1938) and Italian Futurism to {{the debate on the}} birth of the new Chinese drama movement during the 20 s and 30 s of the last century. This is done through the reading and analysis of his essays and his four translations of Italian futurist plays, published in Dongfang zazhi in 1921. Song Chunfang was in disagreement with the New Youth group, supporters of Ibsenian theater, and in his essays he tries to present other European avant-garde examples, such as Futurist plays, which he considered more appropriated to the creation of Chinese spoken drama. Indeed he was convinced that the social problem play, proposed by Xin qingnian group, was not helping the birth of new Chinese drama, but on the contrary was restricting the new spoken drama only to narrow academic circles of that period. In his opinion the mistake made by supporters of realist theater in China is twofold: on one hand their dramaturgical choices do not make the circulation of spoken theater any easier; on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand they show the need for the renovation of Chinese theater only for what regards the content of <b>the</b> pieces, <b>forgetting</b> completely <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> needed reforms, those which relate to technical and artistic aspects of the art. For this reason Song tried to use Italian Futurist Theater, and other Western avant-garde dramaturgical authors, to reduce the realist ‘fever’ which had spread to the debate on modern Chinese theatre {{and at the same time}} used them to support his concept of new theatre. In his mind, the theatre reform should concern all features of this dramaturgical art: content, subjects, lighting, performing art and other technical aspects. For this purpose he supposed Futurist plays could be a useful source and guiding light...|$|R

One of the boys called Morio, a six-year-old boy, fell from the swing when they were playing. He remained unconscious for about 12 years in a hospital. Morio’s friends and family tried to escape from <b>the</b> tragedy and <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> this accident. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> two boys, Mikihiko and Tomonari, had grown up and nearly <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> Morio. Finally, Morio woke up and regained consciousness suddenly. However, Morio’s intelligence quotient stayed at 6 years old. Mikihiko decided to help Morio {{to catch up with}} the society. Therefore, Mikihiko had to sacrifice a lot of things in order to spend time and look after Morio, for instance, he broke up with his girlfriend Kie, quitted university and his free time etc. Nevertheless, Mikihiko failed to let Morio became accustomed to the society because Morio still had a childish and naive heart. Morio came back to the hospital and Mikihiko continued to live his own life at the end. Eventually, Mikihiko realised that everyone, even the ones who are childish as Morio could not escape from the reality of growing up and has to face the world which was ugly as sin.|$|R

40|$|En este artículo se hace una revisión documental de las políticas de lectura en el país. Se tratará lo referente al ámbito normativo de las acciones sociales, siguiendo, por un lado, a Eisner (1998) quien lo denomina dimensión teleológica o intencional, es decir, la regularización de lo relacionado con la lectura —saber, promoción, investigación-; y, por otro, a Habermas (1989 a) en cuanto a lo que el autor llama acciones reguladas por normas, que se consideran, para efectos de este escrito, las políticas de promoción de lectura, tales como planes, programas, proyectos, que organismos gubernamentales han diseñado y puesto en práctica en torno a la formación y consolidación de un país lector. En este sentido, en el de las acciones normativas, se examina lo atinente a los planes de lectura y demás políticas que tienen al libro y a los lectores como centros de interés. Se verá cómo se va transformando en la esfera pública, a través de programas y proyectos, la concepción de lectura, sus ámbitos de acción, los objetivos trazados, y simultáneamente la praxis lectora. De un ámbito exclusivamente escolar, se transita a otros contextos de familia y, más recientemente, se convierte en una visión sistémica de participación que involucra comunidades, organismos, instituciones, sin olvidar la escuela y otros espacios educativos. También se muestra que las políticas de lectura toman en cuenta tanto los destinatarios como los procesos de producción, organización, distribución y difusión de libros y demás materiales escritos. 125 - 168 mariauxi 65 @gmail. comAnualThis {{article is}} based on {{documentary}} research of the reading politics in Venezuela. The normative aspect of social actions is addressed by following Eisner (1998), who refers to this as the teleological or intentional dimension, that is to say, the regulation of everything related to reading—knowledge, promotion, research. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, Habermas (1998 a) serves as a frame for what he calls norm-governed actions, which are considered here as the policies for the promotion of reading, such as plans, programs, and projects that government organizations have designed and put into practice for the foundation and consolidation of a reading country. In this latter aspect, we examine the reading plans and other policies that have the book and the readers as the focus of interest. It will be seen how the programs and projects in the public area transform the notion of reading, its radius of action, the goals set, and simultaneously, the reading praxis. Having the school environment as the starting point, the process moves through the context of the family until it becomes a systemic vision of participation that involves communities, organizations, and institutions, without <b>forgetting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> school and <b>other</b> educational spaces. It is also shown that the reading policies take into account both the recipients and the processes of production, organization, distribution, and promotion of books and other written materials...|$|R
