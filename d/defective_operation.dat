This <b>operation</b> was performed in 17 hips (16 children), with congenital dislocation and false acetabula. The mean age at operation was 5. 1 years (4 to 8). The patients were followed clinically and radiologically for a mean of 6. 3 years (5 to 10). A total of 16 hips had excellent results {{and there was one}} fair result due to avascular necrosis. The centre-edge angles and the obliquity of the acetabular roof improved in all cases, from a mean of- 15. 9 ˚ (- 19 ˚ to 3 ˚) and 42. 6 ˚ (33 ˚ to 46 ˚) to a mean of 29. 5 ˚ (20 ˚ to 34 ˚) and 11. 9 ˚ (9 ˚ to 19 ˚), respectively. The technique is not complex and is stable without internal fixation. It provides a near-normal acetabulum that requires minimal remodelling, and allows early mobilisation. The treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip after walking begins and dysplasia in the older child are challenging problems. In chil-dren older than four years, the bony deformity is increased and the potential for remodelling decreased. 1 Various procedures to correct ace-tabular dysplasia have been described includ-ing innominate osteotomy, 2 acetabuloplasty, 3 shelf arthroplasty, 4 and innominate osteotomy with medial displacement of the acetabulum. 5 This study describes an acetabuloplasty in which the portion of ilium that forms the false acetabulum is redirected to restore the shape and size of the acetabulum...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} CFD {{simulations}} of a reinforced exhaust system (the Aaberg exhaust hood in particular). The reinforced suction effect {{is achieved by}} means of radial jet release. The radial jet deforms the flow pattern {{in front of the}} hood to a directional flow pattern. Unfortunately, the presence of an obstacle, such as a welding bench, leads to a <b>defective</b> <b>operation</b> of the hood. A number of CFD simulations has been undertaken in order to assess the effect of the obstacle size, its distance to the hood, and the hood declination from the normal of the obstacle surface, on the flow pattern and consequently the capture efficiency of the hood. Capture efficiency of selected cases was evaluated. For the purpose of capture efficiency evaluation, a heat source was defined within the model that imitated a metal arc welding process and introduced similar heat input into the domain altogether with a release of a passive scalar. The scalar concentration was then evaluated at the hood opening, thus capture efficiency could be calculated. The results of simulations indicate that the hood operation depends on the spatial arrangement of the hood and the obstacle. The best performance was achieved when the hood axis was aligned with the obstacle surface normal or the misalignment was small. Greater misalignment can be tolerated when the obstacle size is smaller than the hoodtoobstacle distance only...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Decline in cardiac pump {{function}} is {{a hallmark of}} aging where mitochondrial decay is an important underlying cause. Although certainly multifactorial in nature, both dysfunction of the machinery involved in the chemiosmotic process of energy transduction and lower capacity to maintain fatty acid-driven respiration are identified as intrinsic factors of mitochondrial decay in the aged myocardium. Age-associated destabilization of electron transport supercomplexes as a potential factor of mitochondrial decay in the rat heart. <b>Defective</b> <b>operation</b> of the electron transport chain (ETC) constitutes a key mechanism involved in the age-associated loss of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, the molecular events underlying inefficient electron flux that ultimately leads to higher superoxide appearance and impaired respiration are not fully known. As recent biophysical evidence shows that the ETC may form large macromolecular assemblies (i. e. supercomplexes) that disintegrate in certain pathologies (e. g. heart failure or Barth syndrome) reminiscent of aging, we investigated the hypothesis that alterations in supercomplexes are {{partly responsible for the}} age-related loss of cardiac ETC function. In this dissertation, age-associated changes in supercomplex organization and stability were investigated in subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillary (IFM) mitochondria isolated from cardiac tissue from young (3 - 5 months) and old (24 - 28 months) male Fischer 344 rats. Blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) analysis of digitonin-solubilized mitochondrial membranes coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate supercomplex organization. Results show that both SSM and IFM display supercomplexes comprised of various stoichiometries of complexes I, III and IV (never complex II), which typically organize as high mass (1500 - 2300 kDa) assemblies containing up to four copies of complex IV (i. e. I₁III₂IV[subscript N]-type supercomplexes). Interestingly, analysis of IFM proteins showed that, in general, supercomplex levels declined by up to 15...|$|E

New developments in NDE {{are motivated by}} the desire for quality control of manufactured parts and {{by the need to}} maintain the safe operation of industrial plant and machinery. Aircraft, nuclear power plants, gas pipelines and many other complex systems supporting the needs of advanced societies rely on inspection for reliable and safe operation. Much of the research effort in NDE is aligned with the interests of the broader community of scientists and engineers who study inverse problems and their applications in areas such as geophysics, medical imaging, remote sensing or underwater acoustics, to mention but a few. Indeed, many of the basic methods adopted for NDE including tomography, synthetic aperture techniques and iterative inversions, under many guises, are widely used in these areas. In view of this common interest, and the benefits of bringing the distinct problems that arise in a particular technical area to the attention of a wider audience, it would seem appropriate and timely to publish this special section on electromagnetic and ultrasonic {{nondestructive evaluation}}. Although the mere detection of an anomaly in a newly manufactured component might be sufficient cause to condemn it to the scrapheap, it is often expedient, following in-service inspections, to maintain a <b>defective</b> structure in <b>operation.</b> In the field, the cost of replacement or repair is weighed up against the probability and price of failure, which may, in severe cases, include damage to the environment or loss of life. A full and valid assessment depends on the knowledge of a number of factors such as the risks involved and {{the current state of the}} damage. Inversion techniques can play a significant role in damage assessment because the raw inspection data provide only indirect knowledge of defects. The challenge for the researcher is to provide the tools for their improved characterization through the use of imaging and inversion techniques. Typical (yet far from unique) defects in aging components are fatigue cracks and regions of material loss due to corrosion. Ultrasonic and electromagnetic testing (mostly, but not only, at eddy current frequencies) and their combination with other investigation modalities, provide, as a minimum, an indication from sparse data that a defect is present and, at best, a limited data set that is adequate to reconstruct the flaw geometry or to generate a reasonable visual representation of the flaw in the form of an image. Improvements in inspection methods and the ability to acquire large quantities of data automatically will undoubtedly provide the inspiration in the future for refinements in the inversion methods currently used or undergoing development in this field as well as for completely new tools that should be put forth in, probably, unexpected ways. This special section contains twelve articles involving almost forty authors and more than fifteen research groups worldwide. These articles combine theoretical, computational and/or experimental developments, and may be either a review of the most recent advances in a particular area of research or an original and specialized contribution. In short, and all taken together, they attempt to summarize the progress made and the current status of developments after a period of twenty or so years as well as opening up some new paths of investigation at the modeling and/or application level...|$|R
40|$|Mitochon-dria {{generate}} reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) as byproducts of molecular oxygen consumption in the electron transport chain. Most cellular oxygen is consumed in the cytochrome-c oxidase complex of the respiratory chain, which does not generate reactive species. The ubiquinone pool of complex III of respiration is the major site within the respiratory chain that generates Superoxide anion {{as a result of}} a single electron transfer to molecular oxygen. Superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the former by Superoxide dismutase, are precursors of hydroxyl radical through the participation of transition metals. Glutathione (GSH) in mitochondria is the only defense available to metabolize hydrogen peroxide. A small fraction of the total cellular GSH pool is sequestered in mitochondria by the action of a carrier that transports GSH from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria are not only one of the main cellular sources of ROS, they also are a key target of ROS. Mitochondria are subcellular targets of cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF); depletion of GSH in this organelle renders the cell more susceptible to oxidative stress originating in mitochondria. Ceramide generated during TNF signaling leads to increased production of ROS in mitochondria. Chronic ethanol-fed hepatocytes are selectively depleted of GSH in mitochondria due to a <b>defective</b> <b>operation</b> of the carrier responsible for transport of GSH from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. Under these conditions, limitation of the mitochondrial GSH pool represents a critical contributory factor that sensitizes alcoholic hepatocytes to the prooxidant effects of cytokines and prooxidants generated by oxidative metabolism of ethanol. S-adenosyl-Lmethionine prevents development of the ethanol-induced defect. The mitochondrial GSH carrier has been functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with mRNA from rat liver. This critical carrier displays functional characteristics distinct from other plasma membrane GSH carriers, such as its ATP dependency, inhibitor specificity, and the size class of mRNA that encode the corresponding carrier, suggesting that the mitochondrial carrier of GSH is a gene product distinct from the plasma membrane transporters. {{reactive oxygen species}}; antioxidants; gene regulation; signal transduction; nuclear factor-ÎºB; ceramides; tumor necrosis factor; glutathione Copyright Â© 1997 the American Physiological Society.

40|$|Human {{powers of}} moral {{reasoning}} and motivation are fragile. How should citizens {{committed to the}} achievement of liberal justice respond to this fact? This dissertation theorises a class of moral requirements that {{are central to the}} practice of liberal democracy but have been recently overlooked by political philosophers: the fortificational duties, which enjoin citizens to design and submit to civic practices that improve both their moral reasoning and the motivational resilience of their sense of justice. It considers the proposition that a conception of justice is unjustified if unlikely to generate its own freely willed maintenance, or stability, in the face of human nature, and it argues that this proposition is false. If justice may face overwhelming resistance unless steps are taken to fortify ourselves against our own fallibility, the right response is to pursue precisely such fortification. Chapter One sketches the orienting ideal of the dissertation: an ideal of a social world in which citizens live together as free and equal. Chapter Two assesses the proposition that we ought to modify or abandon this ideal if we determine that it is unlikely to be freely realised without serious civic or institutional assistance—a move suggested by John Rawls’s “stability test”—and it argues that the candidate arguments for this conclusion fail. The chapter instead argues that citizens are subject to moral requirements to fortify their sense of justice by designing and submitting to measures that increase the likelihood that they will accurately identify and freely comply with their fundamental moral duties. These measures together constitute a liberal democracy’s “stability charter. ” Chapters Three to Six explore proposed elements of citizens’ stability charter. Chapter Three discusses the fortification of moral reasoning through democratic deliberation. Chapter Four considers what institutional mechanisms could keep democracy oriented toward the achievement of justice despite human fallibility, and it defends a minimalist conception of judicial review as a case study. Chapter Five argues that the practice of criminal punishment is justified by the duties of wrongdoers to pursue additional fortificational measures in the aftermath of their moral powers’ <b>defective</b> <b>operation.</b> And Chapter Six focuses on the special problem posed to the enduring achievement of justice by “unreasonable citizens” who reject fundamental liberal values. The distinctive contribution of the dissertation lies, firstly, in its novel appropriation of the Rawlsian ideal of stability—reconceiving stability not as a justificatory condition set by reason on our convictions, but as a practical challenge that our own convictions set for us —and, secondly, in its deployment of that insight to motivate novel arguments about the character of democratic deliberation, the limits and role of judicial review, the proper purposes of criminal punishment, and the ideal method of engagement with unreasonable citizens.

40|$|Gao, Guang R. The Cray XMT {{supercomputer}} {{system is}} the third generation of the Cray MTA supercomputer architecture. It is a scalable massively multithreaded platform {{which is based on}} the Cray XT infrastructure and uses the Cray massively parallel processing (MPP) system design. The XMT system uses Threadstorm processors which have a global shared memory. A very interesting feature of XMT is that it provides a fine-grain data-centric synchronization for managing concurrency by extending each memory word with tag bits. A tag bit can be in one of two states: full or empty. Cray XMT supports a number of synchronized memory operations to read from and write to tagged memory. A synchronized read/write operation can be suspended if a corresponding memory cell is not in an expected state. For example, a synchronized memory operation can be suspended if it reads from an empty memory address or writes to a full memory address. If in a parallel program a suspended operation can never get to an expected memory state, the operation will be suspended forever. We say that the program/operation is "deadlocked". Although the synchronized operations provide extreme exibility to implement fine-grain parallelization of both regular and irregular applications, it is very easy to get programs into deadlock. And {{due to the lack of}} parallel program debugging tools and runtime support to detect such program deadlocks, it is hard to locate this kind of synchronization errors. So it is important to develop an effective static analysis algorithm which can detect them as early as possible. The typestate analysis is a static program verification technique which can identify illegal operations performed on some objects due to the wrong object state. However, almost all the previous works on typestate analysis only deal with sequential programs and cannot work for concurrent programs. In this thesis we present a new analysis technique, called memory state flow analysis to determine whether a given parallel program with synchronized read/write operations will deadlock. We extend the classical static single assignment (SSA) form with memory state information (called MSSA form) and use that to compute the memory state of each program variable at certain program points. Based on the MSSA form, we perform memory state verification to determine whether a synchronized read or write operation will ever be deadlocked. Our approach can also handle pointer variables and array sections. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a framework to do memory state analysis is built, which catches the main features related to the memory state of parallel programs. (2) a memory state veri cation method to detect a potential program deadlock is developed. Thus, the essentially exponential-complex problem is decoupled and solved using dataflow analysis with simple heuristics, and most program deadlocks problems can be caught by careful heuristics design. We have implemented our analysis using the Open 64 compiler, and we present some preliminary results. The preliminary results show that our memory state flow analysis can detect most of the program deadlock problems. For example we can detect program deadlocks due to unbalanced synchronized operation types, <b>defective</b> <b>operation</b> order, etc. We also include a survey of related work, such as static program veri cation for concurrent systems, program representation and dataflow analysis for parallel programs, typestate analysis, etc. A conclusion and a survey of future work are also presented.
