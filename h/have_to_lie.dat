5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{down for an}} hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
25|$|Wiring parties {{faced the}} {{constant}} {{danger of being}} noticed by enemy searchlights or troops. Enemy sentries were trained to listen and look for these nighttime raiders, and any suspicious sounds or movements could give away the men's position and consequently bring a concentration of heavy fire that way. Unprotected and often standing, wiring parties were subject to enemy flares which would expose them immediately, causing them to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> flat, even on the very wire they were carrying.|$|E
500|$|From 1842 onwards, Chopin {{showed signs}} of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much." [...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him [...] "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on your belly and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. It makes me feel quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to you {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E

2500|$|As Hollywood {{deteriorated}} in the 1970s and 1980s, {{the neighborhood}} around El Cabrillo became dangerous. [...] In his book Lost Hollywood, David Wallace noted: [...] "By the late 1980s, the problem {{had become so}} bad that those few residents who remained in once-celebrated buildings like El Cabrillo...would often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{on the floor to}} avoid being hit by bullets flying through their windows." ...|$|E

2500|$|Polish foremen {{were used}} to manage and {{supervise}} the workers. many immigrants did not speak English and were wholly dependent on their foreman to communicate to the company. Photographer Lewis Hine spoke with one foreman, who recruited Poles from Baltimore, who said, [...] "I tell you, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to employees. They're never satisfied. Hard work to get them." [...] The foremen were allowed to beat their workers and functioned as pimps in some cases. Nesterowicz found some foremen convinced attractive women to sleep with their American bosses in exchange for higher-paying positions. The moral degradation and exploitation in the oyster farms led a local Polish priest, Father Helinski, to ask Polish organizations to dissuade any more Poles from entering the business.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is also a}} quick proof, by Morris Hirsch, {{based on}} the impossibility of a {{differentiable}} retraction. [...] The indirect proof starts by noting that the map f can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; {{this can be done}} by using the Weierstrass approximation theorem, for example. [...] One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable. [...] Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by Sard's theorem, which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity). [...] Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the boundary of the original ball—which is impossible in a retraction.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Dean and Sam do not {{get paid}} for their hunting, the {{brothers}} earn their living and pay for their hunting equipment through credit card fraud, poker winnings, and pool hustling. Furthermore, their investigations often {{put them on the}} wrong side of the law, as they have desecrated graves, impersonated various officials, and committed breaking and entering. Framed for murder and bank robbery by shapeshifters, Dean has become a highly wanted man, and the brothers are occasionally pursued by various law enforcement officers, most notably FBI agent Victor Henricksen. Because of their wanted status, the brothers often use aliases, usually derived from hard rock musicians, film references, or a meta-reference. However, in the third season's mid-season finale episode [...] "Jus in Bello", Sam and Dean are presumed dead in the explosion of the Monument, Colorado Sheriff's county jail, effectively ending the FBI's pursuit of them. By the seventh season, however, the FBI are in pursuit of the brothers again, believing them to be mass-murderers (while the murders were actually committed by Leviathans impersonating the Winchesters). However, with the help of a sheriff who learns the truth and the bodies of their doppelgangers, they are able to fake their deaths again, but <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> low to prevent discovery, abandoning the Impala, taking on new aliases and using stolen cars to get around. By season 8, the threat of discovery seems to blow over as Sam and Dean return to using the Impala and their rock band aliases which they had been warned made them easy to find. Notably in [...] "Ask Jeeves" [...] in season 10, they use their real names and even though a detective is investigating a murder, he doesn't recognize them from [...] "their" [...] previous crime sprees.|$|E
