5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is <b>exactly</b> 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is <b>exactly</b> equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Sources vary {{concerning}} <b>exactly</b> {{which side}} was victorious during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (equivalently, endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, <b>exactly</b> {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers are <b>exactly</b> the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E
5|$|B.s. 'Coastal Candles', {{propagated}} by Merv Hodge, {{came from}} Philip Vaughan's 'Schnapper Point' plant. Some plants are behaving differently, {{so it may}} be that not all material is <b>exactly</b> the same clone.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, every {{directed}} acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, {{this property}} {{can be used as}} an alternative definition of the {{directed acyclic graph}}s: they are <b>exactly</b> the graphs that have topological orderings.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic era, {{there was}} a move {{among some of the}} German states to reform their systems of {{measurement}} using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units. Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the Ruthe (rods) as being 3.0m <b>exactly</b> and defined the subunits of the Ruthe as 1 Ruthe = 10Fuß (feet) = 100Zoll (inches) = 1,000Linie (lines) = 10,000Punkt (points) while the Pfund was defined as being 500g, divided into 30Loth, each of 16.67g. Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian Pfund from 561.288g to 560g <b>exactly,</b> consisting of 32 Loth, each of 17.5g while the Prussian Pfund remained at 467.711g.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exactly</b> how {{disturbances}} {{of production}} and aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide give rise to the pathology of AD is not known.|$|E
5|$|First contact—when the Moon's limb (edge) is <b>exactly</b> {{tangential}} to the Sun's limb.|$|E
5|$|Geminate consonants are {{pronounced}} long, almost <b>exactly</b> {{with the}} double duration {{of a single}} consonant.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017 (<b>exactly</b> {{a decade}} after the release of the game), Halo 3 became {{available}} on the Xbox One via backwards compatibility.|$|E
5|$|In {{imperfect}} Batesian mimicry, the mimics do not <b>exactly</b> resemble their models. Many reasons {{have been}} suggested for this.|$|E
5|$|Observe that in {{the special}} case of a water–silver {{interface}} where the contact angle is equal to 90°, the liquid–solid/solid–air surface tension difference is <b>exactly</b> zero.|$|E
5|$|October 6, 1958– A {{tropical}} depression from the Pacific dissipated over the state, after crossing Sonora and Arizona. This was <b>exactly</b> {{a year after}} another depression dissipated in the state. The depression produced rainfall in the state.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} how the 'elements' of water, air etc are <b>exactly</b> as needed.|$|E
5|$|Since 1896, Saint Anselm {{graduates}} {{have participated}} in nearly <b>exactly</b> the same graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, <b>exactly</b> repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less <b>exactly</b> repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are <b>exactly</b> 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that <b>exactly</b> twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are <b>exactly</b> two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|The 584-day average {{interval}} between successive close approaches to Earth is almost <b>exactly</b> equal to 5Venusian solar days, but {{the hypothesis of}} a spin–orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have <b>exactly</b> two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with <b>exactly</b> three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil parish}} of Chard Town (its formal name) {{contains}} <b>exactly</b> five electoral wards — Avishayes, Coome, Crimchard, Holyrood, and Jocelyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{clips from}} The Underwater Menace, episode 2 were later found to {{precisely}} match the edits {{to the print}} discovered in late 2011, suggesting that the recovered episode was <b>exactly</b> the same print that had been censored decades before.|$|E
5|$|The dates {{given for}} {{construction}} {{are often not}} <b>exactly</b> known. Where {{this is the case}} the century of first construction of the existing building is given.|$|E
5|$|The join-irreducible {{elements}} of this lattice are <b>exactly</b> connected graphs. This can be shown using {{the fact that a}} homomorphism maps a connected graph into one connected component of the target graph.|$|E
5|$|The king moves <b>exactly</b> one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special {{move with}} the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).|$|E
5|$|The moon being almost <b>exactly</b> at perigee (making its angular {{diameter}} {{as large}} as possible).|$|E
5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes <b>exactly</b> two orbits and Ganymede makes <b>exactly</b> one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors {{at the same point}} in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E
5|$|The muscles <b>exactly</b> {{relate to}} the joints, {{operating}} them mechanically like the wires and strings of a puppet. A complex case is the tongue. Sphincter muscles are admired also.|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space <b>exactly</b> when the subdivision rule is conformal, {{as described in the}} combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E
5|$|The {{scramble}} display has <b>exactly</b> {{the same}} letter frequencies as the underlying plaintext.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} detailing <b>exactly</b> when Kentucky's {{provisional government}} ceased operation. It {{is assumed to}} have dissolved upon {{the conclusion of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) {{measures}} a pitcher's ability {{at preventing}} hitters from reaching base. It is calculated <b>exactly</b> {{as its name}} suggests.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} reaches <b>exactly</b> 31 points, he must {{announce}} this feat to all participants {{before the next}} player shoots a shot {{in order to be}} victorious. If this is not done, the player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes up again in rotation. If another player in the interim successfully scores <b>exactly</b> 31, and properly announces it, that player wins the game.|$|E
25|$|Thus, a {{temperature}} difference of one degree Celsius {{and that of}} one kelvin are <b>exactly</b> the same, with the null point of the Kelvin scale (0K) at <b>exactly</b> −273.15°C, and the null point of the Celsius scale (0°C) at <b>exactly</b> 273.15K.|$|E
25|$|Two events cannot {{occur at}} <b>exactly</b> the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval <b>exactly</b> one event either occurs {{or does not}} occur.|$|E
