25|$|Severe GH {{deficiency}} {{in early childhood}} also results in slower muscular development, so that <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> milestones such as standing, walking, and jumping may be delayed. Body composition (i.e., the relative amounts of bone, muscle, and fat) is affected in many children with severe deficiency, so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common (though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity). Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence (said to resemble a kewpie doll).|$|E

However, the effect of CCDC142 may have been confounded for these phenotypes since there were also abnormalities in many other genomic sections.|$|E
25|$|Babies {{born with}} severe CP often have an {{irregular}} posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as spinal curvature, a small jawbone, {{or a small}} head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older. Some babies born with CP do not show obvious signs right away. Classically, CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> developmental delay is seen.|$|E

25|$|CP is {{classified}} by {{the types of}} motor impairment of the limbs or organs, and by restrictions to the activities an affected person may perform. The <b>Gross</b> <b>Motor</b> Function Classification System-Expanded and Revised and the Manual Ability Classification System are used to describe mobility and manual dexterity in people with cerebral palsy, and recently the Communication Function Classification System, and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System have been proposed to describe those functions. There are three main CP classifications by motor impairment: spastic, ataxic, and athetoid/dyskinetic. Additionally, there is a mixed type that shows a combination of features of the other types. These classifications reflect {{the areas of the}} brain that are damaged.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} myopathies, the {{clinical}} manifestations of MTM/CNM are most notably muscle weakness and associated disabilities. Congenital forms often present with neonatal low muscle tone, severe weakness, delayed developmental milestones (particularly <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> milestones such as head control, crawling, and walking) and pulmonary complications (presumably due to {{weakness of the}} muscles responsible for respiration). While some patients with centronuclear myopathies remain ambulatory throughout their adult life, others may never crawl or walk and may require wheelchair use for mobility. There is substantial variability {{in the degree of}} functional impairment among the various centronuclear myopathies. Although this condition only affects the voluntary muscles, several children have suffered from cardiac arrest, possibly due to the additional stress placed on the heart.|$|E
25|$|Movement and posture {{limitations}} are aspects of all CP types {{and as a}} result, CP has historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age. Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on clinical assessment {{used in conjunction with}} milestone reporting. The majority of ADCP assessments now use the <b>Gross</b> <b>Motor</b> Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP. ADCP is typically characterized by an individual’s inability to control their muscle tone, which is readily assessed via these classification systems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundStudies on motor {{performance}} and its early markers are rare in China, especially in very {{low birth weight}} (VLBW) infants. ObjectiveApart from {{the assessment of the}} inter-scorer agreement, we aimed to analyze to what extent the motor repertoire at 10 to 18 weeks postterm was related to neonatal complications, and <b>gross</b> and fine <b>motor</b> performance at 12 months after term. Study designExploratory prospective study. SubjectsSeventy-four VLBW infants (58 males; mean gestational age= 29 weeks; mean birth weight= 1252 g). MethodFive-minute video recordings were performed at 10 to 18 weeks after term; fidgety movements and the concurrent motor patterns (resulting in a motor optimality score) were assessed according to the Prechtl general movements assessment (GMA). The <b>gross</b> and fine <b>motor</b> performance was assessed by means of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, second edition, at 12 months. ResultsReliability was excellent. Pneumonia was associated with absent fidgety movements; the motor optimality score was lower in infants with pneumonia and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Both absent fidgety movements and a lower motor optimality score were associated with a poor or very poor <b>gross</b> and fine <b>motor</b> performance at the 12 -month-assessment. ConclusionBoth the assessment of fidgety movements and the evaluation of the concurrent motor repertoire contribute significantly to an identification of VLBW children with a poor <b>gross</b> and fine <b>motor</b> outcome at 12 months. The results of this study document the need for an early identification of infants at high risk for a poor motor performance...|$|R

25|$|Most reviews {{conclude}} that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, {{recent studies have}} been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a central nervous system depressant. Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the Maddox wing test (a measure of deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of isometric force (i.e. fine motor control is impaired), though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> abilities.|$|E
25|$|Schneider et al. {{also studied}} {{the effects of}} {{combining}} music therapy with standard motor rehabilitation methods. In this experiment, researchers recruited stroke patients without prior musical experience and trained half of them in an intensive step by step training program that occurred fifteen times over three weeks, in addition to traditional treatment. These participants were trained to use both fine and <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> movements by learning {{how to use the}} piano and drums. The other half of the patients received only traditional treatment {{over the course of the}} three weeks. Three-dimensional movement analysis and clinical motor tests showed participants who received the additional music therapy had significantly better speed, precision, and smoothness of movement as compared to the control subjects. Participants who received music therapy also showed a significant improvement in every-day motor activities as compared to the control group. Wilson, Parsons, & Reutens looked at the effect of melodic intonation therapy (MIT) on speech production in a male singer with severe Broca's aphasia. In this study, thirty novel phrases were taught in three conditions: unrehearsed, rehearsed verbal production (repetition), or rehearsed verbal production with melody (MIT). Results showed that phrases taught in the MIT condition had superior production, and that compared to rehearsal, effects of MIT lasted longer.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with stroke, {{physical}} therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved {{by the use of}} ankle foot orthoses. PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other <b>gross</b> <b>motor</b> functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.|$|E

2500|$|Classification of {{cerebral}} palsy can {{be based on}} severity, topographic distribution, or motor function. Severity is typically assessed via the <b>Gross</b> <b>Motor</b> Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (described further below). Classification based on motor characteristics classifies CP as occurring from damage to either the corticospinal pathway or extrapyramidal regions. Athetoid dyskinetic {{cerebral palsy}} is a non-spastic, extrapyramidal form of cerebral palsy (spastic cerebral palsy, in contrast, results from damage to the brain’s corticospinal pathways). Non-spastic cerebral palsy {{is divided into two}} groups, ataxic and dyskinetic. [...] Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is separated further into two different groups; choreoathetoid and dystonic. Choreo-athetotic CP is characterized by involuntary movements most predominantly found in the face and extremities. Dystonic ADCP is characterized by slow, strong contractions, which may occur locally or encompass the whole body.|$|E
