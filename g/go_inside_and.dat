25|$|Inside the {{pedestal}} of the statue, the Man in Black, {{who has taken}} the form of Locke, sends Ben to get Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). Richard, however, refuses to <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The Man in Black transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. The Man in Black then tells Ben what Locke's final thoughts were, and explains that his own true goal is to return home. The Man in Black finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The Man in Black then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the Man in Black quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|E

2500|$|On April 3, 2007, Agnihotri {{became the}} first MLA to be named - that is, asked by the Speaker to leave the {{assembly}} - in Ken Kowalski's nine years as speaker. This occurred as result of questions he asked Minister of Tourism, Parks, Recreation and Culture Hector Goudreau about the Community Initiatives Program, which dispenses grants to community groups. Agnihotri began by noting that, despite a rule that unmatched grants could not exceed ten thousand dollars, forty-three groups had received unmatched grants exceeding that amount. He then asked if these groups included any who had made donations to the leadership campaigns of Ed Stelmach, Dave Hancock, Lyle Oberg, or Ted Morton - {{all of whom were}} cabinet ministers and all of whom had refused to disclose full lists of donors from their leadership campaigns: [...] "Can this minister assure this house that groups receiving this special treatment are not secret friends of top Tories?" [...] Hancock rose on a point of order, and Kowalski ruled that Agnihotri's question impugned the integrity of the ministers, and that the question was a party matter that had no place in the legislature. He asked Agnihotri three times to apologize and, after Agnihotri refused, he named him. Agnihotri was not to be allowed back into the Legislature until he apologized and all members of the assembly agreed to re-admit him. He apologized the next day, saying that his constituents wanted him to and that [...] "if you stay outside, you're not going to help Albertans, so better you <b>go</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> fight for it." ...|$|E
