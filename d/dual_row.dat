40|$|Experiments {{involving}} {{row spacing}} and tillage, originally established in Mackay and Ingham in 2001, were planted {{to a second}} cycle of sugarcane in 2006 following a soybean break. In the second cycle 1. 5 m and 1. 8 m single and 1. 8 m <b>dual</b> <b>rows</b> were established into fully prepared land or land that was kept in permanent beds, receiving no tillage since 2001. In the plant crop in both experiments, tillage produced a highly significant increase in cane and sugar yield {{but there was no}} effect of row spacing. The response to tillage could be attributed to the removal of compaction caused by harvester and haul-outs during the previous cycle. In the first ratoon there was again no effect of row spacing, and surprisingly, no effect of the tillage applied prior to planting in either experiment. The lack of a tillage response in the first ratoon suggests that much of the damage caused by compaction is inflicted during harvesting of the plant crop. Despite large yield differences, economic analysis indicated that there would be little difference in gross margins because of the much higher costs of the tilled system. It is concluded that without GPS guidance, {{as was the case with}} these experiments, cane yields are likely to be reduced with no tillage but these problems may well be overcome by implementing minimum strategic tillage to remove compaction from the planting row...|$|R

The turbulence model has been determined, describing adequately both the thermal and gas-dynamic parameters, the Coriolis force influence on heat transfer in the radial rotating cylindrical channel with flow swirl has been studied. The heat transfer and gas-dynamic calculation procedure has been developed. The novel approach has been studied of the heat transfer control along the channel axial length with tangentially-inclined flow swirl. New heat transfer and gas-dynamic regularities over the flat plate at the secondary flow supply into single- and <b>dual</b> <b>rows</b> of discrete hemispherical dimples and twin holes at the inlet have been established.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a friction-based coupling device for a fiber-optic monitoring system capable of measuring pressure, strain, and temperature that can be deployed on existing subsea structures. A summary is provided of the design concept, prototype development, prototype performance testing, and subsequent design refinements of the device. The results of laboratory testing of the first prototype performed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) are also included. Limitations of the initial concept were identified during testing and future design improvements were proposed and later implemented. These new features enhance the coupling of the sensor device and improve the monitoring system measurement capabilities. A major challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure adequate coupling between the instruments {{and the structure of}} interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based devices have the potential to overcome coupling limitations caused by marine growth and soil contamination on flowlines, risers, and other subsea structures. The work described in this paper investigates the design and test of a friction-based coupling device (herein referred to as a friction clamp) which is suitable for pipelines and structures that are suspended in the water column as well as for those that are resting on the seabed. The monitoring elements consist of fiberoptic sensors that are bonded to a stainless steel clamshell assembly with a high-friction surface coating. The friction clamp incorporates a single hinge design to facilitate installation of the clamp and <b>dual</b> <b>rows</b> of opposing fasteners to distribute the clamping force along the structure. The friction clamp can be modified to be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. NASA-JSC was involved in the selection and testing of the friction coating, and in the design and testing of the prototype clamp device. Four-inch diameter and eight-inch diameter sub-scale friction clamp prototypes were built and tested to evaluate the strain measuring capabilities of the design under different loading scenarios. The testing revealed some limitations of the initial design concept, and subsequent refinements were explored to improve the measurement performance of the system. This study was part of a collaboration between NASA-JSC and Astro Technology Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance technologies that will benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa (SA) {{approximately}} 30 % of sugarcane {{is grown}} under irrigation {{and there is}} increasingpressure to demonstrate efficient use of limited water resources. Agronomic practices {{such as the use}} ofa crop residue layer, changed row spacing, growing suitable varieties and accurate irrigation schedulingcould potentially increase water use efficiency (WUE) by saving water and/or increasing yield. The aim ofthe study was to investigate to what extent WUE of irrigated sugarcane production in SA can be improvedby better agronomic practices, and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms involved in cropresponse to these factors. An overhead irrigated field experiment was conducted near Komatipoort, South Africa on a shallow,well-drained, sandy clay loam over a four year period (one plant (P) and three ratoon crops (R 1, R 2 andR 3)). Treatments consisted of factorial combinations of variety (N 14 and N 26), row spacing (single rowsspaced at 1. 5 m and <b>dual</b> <b>rows</b> spaced at 1. 8 m) and soil surface cover (bare soil and crop residue layer). Measurements included tiller population, interception of photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR), soilwater content, and cane yield at harvest. Crop water use (CWU) was estimated using the water balanceapproach. This study showed that significant reductions in water use and irrigation requirements, and increasesin WUE, are possible by using a crop residue layer to cover the soil. Water savings were largest in P (26 %in CWU and 32 % in irrigation requirement) but substantial savings were also achieved in R crops (about 15 %). It is essential to practice accurate irrigation scheduling to realise these savings, taking into accountsoil cover and cultivar effects, especially during the period of partial canopy. Although the residue layercaused small reductions in yield in the P, R 1 and R 2 crops (on average 9 %) these were not statisticallysignificant. The combined effect of large CWU reductions and small changes in cane yield resulted inincreased WUE (on average 18 %). These responses to a residue layer were achieved through a reduced rate of canopy development dueto delayed emergence of tillers, causing less green canopy cover and reduced CWU, especially during theperiod of partial canopy cover when stalk growth has not yet commenced. CWU and FIPARwere affectedmuch less during the subsequent period of stalk growth, thus affecting cane yield minimally, providedirrigation scheduling was adjusted. Variety N 14 consistently developed a canopy more rapidly, intercepted more radiation and achieveda higher yield than N 26. Row configuration had a significant impact on canopy development, seasonalFIPAR, final stalk population but did not affect cane yield or WUE. The study produced quantitative data for parameterising crop models which will improve their reli-ability in irrigation management and yield prediction applications.

In the months that followed, the range was updated to the single distributor 12A and the 10A motor was discontinued in early 1974. The Series II RX-3 came to Australia in March 1974 powered by the new 12A single distributor (12B). The starter motor was relocated in these updated engines {{from the top of the}} engine to the lower left hand rear side. Other internal 12A changes included moving from <b>dual</b> <b>row</b> side seals to single row and significant changes to apex seal design. The Series II was slower than the 10A Series I down the quarter mile even with the 1,146 cc 12As greater capacity and 15 percent more power.

Model selection then becomes a critical issue, for which the tools that have been derived for model-based one-way clustering need to be adapted.

Removal of nodes in a graph relates to the robustness of a graph.

40|$|The {{off-site}} {{transport of}} agricultural chemicals, such as herbicides, into freshwater and marine ecosystems is a world-wide concern. The adoption of farm management practices that minimise herbicide transport in rainfall-runoff {{is a priority}} for the Australian sugarcane industry, particularly in the coastal catchments draining into the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. In this study, residual herbicide runoff and infiltration were measured using a rainfall simulator in a replicated trial on a brown Chromosol with 90 – 100 % cane trash blanket cover in the Mackay Whitsunday region, Queensland. Management treatments included conventional 1. 5 m spaced sugarcane beds with a single row of sugarcane (CONV) and 2 m spaced, controlled traffic sugarcane beds with <b>dual</b> sugarcane <b>rows</b> (0. 8 m apart) (2 mCT). The aim was to simulate the first rainfall event after {{the application of the}} photosynthesis inhibiting (PSII) herbicides ametryn, atrazine, diuron and hexazinone, by broadcast (100 % coverage, on bed and furrow) and banding (50 – 60 % coverage, on bed only) methods. These events included heavy rainfall 1 day after herbicide application, considered a worst case scenario, or rainfall 21 days after application. The 2 mCT rows had significantly (P < 0. 05) less runoff (38 %) and lower peak runoff rates (43 %) than CONV rows for a rainfall average of 93 mm at 100 mm h− 1 (1 : 20 yr Average Return Interval). Additionally, final infiltration rates were higher in 2 mCT rows than CONV rows, with 72 and 52 mm h− 1 respectively. This resulted in load reductions of 60, 55, 47, and 48 % for ametryn, atrazine, diuron and hexazinone from 2 mCT rows, respectively. Herbicide losses in runoff were also reduced by 32 – 42 % when applications were banded rather than broadcast. When rainfall was experienced 1 day after application, a large percentage of herbicides were washed off the cane trash. However, by day 21, concentrations of herbicide residues on cane trash were lower and more resistant to washoff, resulting in lower losses in runoff. Consequently, ametryn and atrazine event mean concentrations in runoff were approximately 8 fold lower at day 21 compared with day 1, whilst diuron and hexazinone were only 1. 6 – 1. 9 fold lower, suggesting longer persistence of these chemicals. Runoff collected {{at the end of the}} paddock in natural rainfall events indicated consistent though smaller treatment differences to the rainfall simulation study. Overall, it was the combination of early application, banding and controlled traffic that was most effective in reducing herbicide losses in runoff. Crown copyright © 201...|$|R

40|$|To design, {{construct}} and validate radiofrequency (RF) transmit and receive phased array coils for high-resolution visual cortex imaging at 7 Tesla. A 4 channel transmit and 16 channel receive array was constructed on a conformal polycarbonate former. Transmit field efficiency and homogeneity were simulated and validated, {{along with the}} Specific Absorption Rate, using [Formula: see text] mapping techniques and electromagnetic simulations. Receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temporal SNR (tSNR) across EPI time series, g-factors for accelerated imaging and noise correlations were evaluated and compared with a commercial 32 channel whole head coil. The performance of the coil was further evaluated with human subjects through functional MRI (fMRI) studies at standard and submillimeter resolutions of upto 0. 8 mm isotropic. The transmit and receive sections were characterized using bench tests and showed good interelement decoupling, preamplifier decoupling and sample loading. SNR for the 16 channel coil was ∼ 1. 5 {{times that of the}} commercial coil in the human occipital lobe, and showed better g-factor values for accelerated imaging. fMRI tests conducted showed better response to Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activation, at resolutions of 1. 2 mm and 0. 8 mm isotropic. The 4 channel phased array transmit coil provides homogeneous excitation across the visual cortex, which, in combination with the <b>dual</b> <b>row</b> 16 channel receive array, makes for a valuable research tool for high resolution anatomical and functional imaging of the visual cortex at 7 T...|$|E
40|$|Controlled traffic (matching {{wheel and}} row spacing) is being {{promoted}} {{as a means}} to manage soil compaction in the Australian sugar industry. However, machinery limitations dictate that wider row spacings than the standard 1. 5 -m single row will need to be adopted to incorporate controlled traffic and many growers are reluctant to widen row spacing for fear of yield penalties. To address these concerns, contrasting row configuration and planting density combinations were investigated for their effect on cane and sugar yield in large-scale experiments in the Gordonvale, Tully, Ingham, Mackay, and Bingera (near Bundaberg) sugarcane-growing regions of Queensland, Australia. The results showed that sugarcane possesses a capacity to compensate for different row configurations and planting densities through variation in stalk number and individual stalk weight. Row configurations ranging from 1. 5 -m single rows (the current industry standard) to 1. 8 -m dual rows (50 cm between duals), 2. 1 -m dual (80 cm between duals) and triple (65 cm between triples) rows, and 2. 3 -m triple rows (65 cm between triples) produced similar yields. Four rows (50 cm apart) on a 2. 1 -m configuration (quad rows) produced lower yields largely due to crop lodging, while a 1. 8 -m single row configuration produced lower yields in the plant crop, probably due to inadequate resource availability (water stress/limited radiation interception). The results suggest that controlled traffic can be adopted in the Australian sugar industry by changing from a 1. 5 -m single row to 1. 8 -m <b>dual</b> <b>row</b> configuration without yield penalty. Further, the similar yields obtained with wider row configurations (2 m or greater with multiple rows) in these experiments emphasise the physiological and environmental plasticity that exists in sugarcane. Controlled traffic can be implemented with these wider row configurations (> 2 m), although {{it will be necessary to}} carry out expensive modifications to the current harvester and haul-out equipment. There were indications from this research that not all cultivars were suited to configurations involving multiple rows. The results suggest that consideration be given to assessing clones with different growth habits under a range of row configurations to find the most suitable plant types for controlled traffic cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{promotion}} of controlled traffic (matching wheel and row spacing) in the Australian sugar industry is necessitating a widening of row spacing beyond the standard 1. 5 m. As all cultivars {{grown in the}} Australian industry have been selected under the standard row spacing there are concerns {{that at least some}} cultivars may not be suitable for wider rows. To address this issue, experiments were established in northern and southern Queensland in which cultivars, with different growth characteristics, recommended for each region, were grown under a range of different row configurations. In the northern Queensland experiment at Gordonvale, cultivars Q 187 ((sic)), Q 200 ((sic)), Q 201 ((sic)), and Q 218 ((sic)) were grown in 1. 5 -m single rows, 1. 8 -m single rows, 1. 8 -m dual rows (50 cm between duals), and 2. 3 -m dual rows (80 cm between duals). In the southern Queensland experiment at Farnsfield, cvv. Q 138, Q 205 ((sic)), Q 222 ((sic)) and Q 188 ((sic)) were also grown in 1. 5 -m single rows, 1. 8 -m single rows, 1. 8 -m dual rows (50 cm between duals), while 1. 8 -m-wide throat planted single row and 2. 0 -m <b>dual</b> <b>row</b> (80 cm between duals) configurations were also included. There was no difference in yield between the different row configurations at Farnsfield but there was a significant row configuration x cultivar interaction at Gordonvale due to good yields in 1. 8 -m single and dual rows with Q 201 ((sic)) and poor yields with Q 200 ((sic)) at the same row spacings. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two cultivars in 1. 5 -m single and 2. 3 -m dual rows. The experiments once again demonstrated the compensatory capacity that exists in sugarcane to manipulate stalk number and individual stalk weight as a means of producing similar yields across a range of row configurations and planting densities. There was evidence of different growth patterns between cultivars in response to different row configurations (viz. propensity to tiller, susceptibility to lodging, ability to compensate between stalk number and stalk weight), suggesting that there may be genetic differences in response to row configuration. It is argued that there is a need to evaluate potential cultivars under a wider range of row configurations than the standard 1. 5 -m single rows. Cultivars that perform well in row configurations ranging from 1. 8 to 2. 0 m are essential if the adverse effects of soil compaction are to be managed through the adoption of controlled traffic...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) provides excellent soft tissue contrast for oncology applications. We propose to combine a MRI scanner with a helical tomotherapy (HT) system to enable daily target imaging for improved conformal radiation dose delivery to a patient. HT uses an intensity-modulated fan-beam that revolves around a patient, while the patient slowly advances through {{the plane of}} rotation, yielding a helical beam trajectory. Since {{the use of a}} linear accelerator to produce radiation may be incompatible with the pulsed radiofrequency and the high and pulsed magnetic fields required for MRI, it is proposed that a radioactive Cobalt- 60 (60 Co) source be used instead to provide the radiation. An open low field (0. 25 T) MRI system is proposed where the tomotherapy ring gantry is located between two sets of Helmholtz coils that can generate a sufficiently homogenous main magnetic field. It is shown that the two major challenges with the design, namely acceptable radiation dose rate (and therefore treatment duration) and moving parts in strong magnetic field, can be addressed. The high dose rate desired for helical tomotherapy delivery can be achieved using two radiation sources of 220 TBq (6000 Ci) each on a ring gantry with a source to axis-of-rotation distance of 75 cm. In addition to this, a <b>dual</b> <b>row</b> multi-leaf collimator (MLC) system with 15 mm leaf width at isocentre and relatively large fan beam widths between 15 and 30 mm per row shall be employed. In this configuration, the unit would be well-suited for most pelvic radiotherapy applications where the soft tissue contrast of MRI will be particularly beneficial. Non-magnetic MRI compatible materials must be used for the rotating gantry. Tungsten, which is non-magnetic, can be used for primary collimation of the fan-beam {{as well as for the}} MLC, which allows intensity modulated radiation delivery. We propose to employ a low magnetic Cobalt compound, sycoporite (CoS) for the Cobalt source material itself. Rotational delivery is less susceptible to problems related to the use of a low energy megavoltage photon source while the helical delivery reduces the negative impact of the relatively large penumbra inherent in the use of Cobalt sources for radiotherapy. On the other hand, the use of a 60 Co source ensures constant dose rate with gantry rotation and makes dose calculation in a magnetic field as easy as the range of secondary electrons is limited. The MR-integrated Cobalt tomotherapy unit, dubbed &#x 2032;MiCoTo,&#x 2032; uses two independent physical principles for image acquisition and treatment delivery. It would offer excellent target definition and will allow following target motion during treatment using fast imaging techniques thus providing the best possible input for adaptive radiotherapy. As an additional bonus, quality assurance of the radiation delivery can be performed in situ using radiation sensitive gels imaged by MRI...|$|E
