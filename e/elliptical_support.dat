40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} full-vector electromagnetic Bessel beams obliquely incident at an interface between two electrically different media. We employ a Fourier transform domain representation of Bessel beams to determine their behavior upon reflection and transmission. This transform, which is geometric in nature, consists of <b>elliptical</b> <b>support</b> curves with complex weighting associated with them. The behavior of the scattered field at an interface is highly complex, owing to its full-vector nature; nevertheless, this behavior has a straightforward representation in the transform domain geometry. The analysis shows that the reflected field forms a different vector Bessel beam, but in general, the transmitted field cannot be represented as a Bessel beam. Nevertheless, using this approach, we demonstrate a method to propagate a Bessel beam in the refractive medium by launching a non- Bessel beam at the interface. Several interesting phenomena related to the behavior of Bessel beams are illustrated, such as polarized reflection at Brewster's angle incidence, and the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Federov shifts {{in the case of}} total reflection. © 2013 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} {{integrate}} the Vlasov-Poisson equations giving {{the evolution of a}} dynamical system in phase-space using a continuous set of local basis functions. In practice, the method decomposes the density in phase-space into small smooth units having compact support. We call these small units ``clouds'' and choose them to be Gaussians of <b>elliptical</b> <b>support.</b> Fortunately, the evolution of these clouds in the local potential has an analytical solution, {{that can be used to}} evolve the whole system during a significant fraction of dynamical time. In the process, the clouds, initially round, change shape and get elongated. At some point, the system needs to be remapped on round clouds once again. This remapping can be performed optimally using a small number of Lucy iterations. The remapped solution can be evolved again with the cloud method, and the process can be iterated a large number of times without showing significant diffusion. Our numerical experiments show that it is possible to follow the 2 dimensional phase space distribution during a large number of dynamical times with excellent accuracy. The main limitation to this accuracy is the finite size of the clouds, which results in coarse graining the structures smaller than the clouds and induces small aliasing effects at these scales. However, it is shown in this paper that this method is consistent with an adaptive refinement algorithm which allows one to track the evolution of the finer structure in phase space. It is also shown that the generalization of the cloud method to the 4 dimensional and the 6 dimensional phase space is quite natural. Comment: 46 pages, 25 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report numerically {{observed}} spontaneous vanishing of mean curvature on a developable cone made by pushing a thin elastic sheet into a circular container. We {{show that this}} feature is independent of thickness of the sheet, the supporting radius {{and the amount of}} deflection. Several variants of developable cone are studied to examine the necessary conditions that lead to the vanishing of mean curvature. It is found that the presence of appropriate amount of radial stress is necessary. The developable cone geometry somehow produces the right amount of radial stress to induce just enough radial curvature to cancel the conical azimuthal curvature. In addition, the circular symmetry of supporting container edge plays an important role. With an <b>elliptical</b> <b>supporting</b> edge, the radial curvature overcompensates the azimuthal curvature near the minor axis and undercompensates near the major axis. Our numerical finding is verified by a crude experiment using a reflective plastic sheet.

The X-ray spectra of Sa galaxies are intermediate between those of ellipticals and spirals, suggesting that these galaxies contain hot gaseous emission as well as emission from accreting binaries. In E and SO galaxies the emission temperature becomes higher with a decreasing X-ray to optical luminosity ratio, which suggests that the emission of X-ray faint early-type galaxies consists of a large evolved stellar component, while the gaseous emission becomes dominant in X-ray brighter galaxies. The group with the lowest X-ray to optical ratio does not follow this trend; in these galaxies a very soft X-ray component, amounting to about half the total X-ray emission, is found in addition to the hard X-ray component. Possible explanations are integrated emission of M stars and a relatively cool ISM. A very soft component is also found in several spiral galaxies.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{it was found}} that the instability failure of curved sheet is nearly independent of the type of loading and is primarily a function of the maximum stress, radius-thickness ration and modulus of elasticity. A method of correlating the critical stress of thin sheet under several different types of loading is given. An explanation for the experimental critical stress of thin walled cylinders under bending being greater than that for pure compression is given. The strength of unstiffened thin walled circular nose sections under pure bending was found to be controlled by local instability of the section, rather than a large scale instability. The equation of local instability of curved sheet gives values which are in fair agreement with those found experimentally. The strength of <b>elliptical</b> cylinders <b>supported</b> at the minor axis under bending plus shear loads is governed primarily by the bending strength, and is little effected by the sheer force unless the amount of shear is quite large with respect to the moment. The effect of increasing the amount of elliptically greatly reduces the bending and shear strength of nose sections. Under torsional loads the stress at buckling falls off as the ration of the major to minor axis increases but the failure stress decreases at a slower rate than the buckling stress. The length effect of semi-circular sections under torsion is similar to that of a circular tube, and can be obtained by Donnell's theoretical equation. ...|$|R

Methods. We present the derivation of the general dispersion relation of linear magneto-acoustic wave propagation for a compressible magnetic flux tube with elliptical cross-section in a plasma with finite beta. The wave modes of propagation for the n = 0 (symmetric) sausage and n = 1 (anti-symmetric) kink oscillations are then examined within the limit of the thin flux tube approximation. Results. It is shown that a compressible magnetic tube with <b>elliptical</b> cross-section <b>supports</b> slow and fast magneto-acoustic waves. In the thin tube approximation, the slow sausage mode and the slow and fast kink modes are found in analogue to a circular cross-section. However, the kink modes propagate with different phase speeds {{depending on whether the}} axial displacement takes place along the major or minor axis of the ellipse. This feature is present in both the slow and the fast bands, providing two infinite sets of slow kink modes and two infinite sets of fast kink modes, i. e. each corresponding cylindrical mode splits into two sets of modes due to the ellipticity. The difference between the phase speeds along the different axis is dependent on the ratio of the lengths of the two axes. Analytical expressions for the phase speeds are found. We show that the sausage modes do not split due to the introduced ellipticity and only the phase speed is modified when compared to the appropriate cylindrical counterpart.
