Sinking again into her chair to listen she showed a deep interest in the anecdote. Then thinking it over gravely she returned with her odd intonation: “Yes, but you do see him!” I had to admit that this was the case; and I wasn’t so prepared with an <b>effective</b> <b>attenuation</b> as I could have wished. She eased the situation off, however, by the charming quaintness with which she finally said: “Well, I wouldn’t want him to be lonely!” This time she rose in earnest, but I persuaded her to let me keep the album to show Mr. Paraday. I assured her I’d bring it back to her myself. “Well, you’ll find my address somewhere in it on a paper!” she sighed all resignedly at the door.|$|E

The material examined is carbon steel plates with various thicknesses ranging from 2 mm to 13 mm. There are two aspects in this study; determination of the attenuation coefficient using theoretical method, and from experiments. Two types of detectors are used; the film radiography and ion chamber. The gamma ray source is the polychromatic radionuclide Iridium- 192. Cross section of the incoherent scattering of every element in the carbon steel material sample has been calculated using the Klein-Nishina formula incorporating the structure function correction. We integrate the Klein-Nishina formula using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature and the cross section agrees very well with the published results. The cross section of the incoherent scattering is used to calculate the theoretical <b>effective</b> linear <b>attenuation</b> coefficient and is found to be 0. 231.

40|$|Abstract Background Calibrating mammograms {{to produce}} a {{standardized}} breast density measurement for breast cancer risk analysis requires an accurate spatial measure of the compressed breast thickness. Thickness inaccuracies due to the nominal system readout value and compression paddle orientation induce unacceptable errors in the calibration. Method A thickness correction was developed and evaluated using a fully specified two-component surrogate breast model. A previously developed calibration approach based on <b>effective</b> radiation <b>attenuation</b> coefficient measurements {{was used in the}} analysis. Water and oil were used to construct phantoms to replicate the deformable properties of the breast. Phantoms consisting of measured proportions of water and oil were used to estimate calibration errors without correction, evaluate the thickness correction, and investigate the reproducibility of the various calibration representations under compression thickness variations. Results The average thickness uncertainty due to compression paddle warp was characterized to within 0. 5 mm. The relative calibration error was reduced to 7 % from 48 - 68 % with the correction. The normalized <b>effective</b> radiation <b>attenuation</b> coefficient (planar) representation was reproducible under intra-sample compression thickness variations compared with calibrated volume measures. Conclusion Incorporating this thickness correction into the rigid breast tissue equivalent calibration method should improve the calibration accuracy of mammograms for risk assessments using the reproducible planar calibration measure. </p...|$|R

For comparison, projections free from the effects of attenuation and scattering were also simulated, giving ideal transaxial images after reconstruction. Three methods of attenuation correction were studied: (a) a pre-processing method, (b) a post-processing uniform method and (c) a post-processing non-uniform method using a density map. The accuracy of these methods was estimated by comparison of the reconstructed images with the ideal images using the normalized mean square error, NMSE, and quantitative values of the regional cerebral blood flow, rCBF. A minimum NMSE was achieved for the <b>effective</b> linear <b>attenuation</b> coefficient mu(eff) = 0. 07 (0. 09) cm(- 1) for the uniform(pre) method, the <b>effective</b> mass <b>attenuation</b> coefficient mu(eff) /rho = 0. 08 (0. 10) cm 2 g(- 1) for the uniform(post) method and mu(eff) /rho = 0. 12 (0. 13) cm 2 g(- 1) for the non-uniform(post) method. Values in parentheses represent the case of dual-window scatter correction. The non-uniform(post) method performed better, as measured by the NMSE, both with and without scatter correction. Furthermore, the non-uniform(post) method gave, on average, more accurate rCBF values.

Work presented here represents {{an essential component of}} an ongoing project that seeks to determine the appropriate method for calibrating (standardizing) mammography image data to account for the x-ray image acquisition influences. Longer term goals of this project are to make accurate breast density measurements in support of risk studies. Methods Logarithmic response calibration curves and <b>effective</b> x-ray <b>attenuation</b> coefficients were measured from two full field digital mammography (FFDM) systems with breast tissue equivalent phantom imaging and compared. Normalization methods were studied to assess the possibility of reducing the amount of calibration data collection. The percent glandular calibration map functional form was investigated. Spatial variations in the calibration data were used to assess the uncertainty in the calibration application by applying error propagation analyses. Results Logarithmic response curves are well approximated as linear. Measured <b>effective</b> x-ray <b>attenuation</b> coefficients are characteristic quantities independent of the imaging system and are in agreement with those predicted numerically. Calibration data collection can be reduced by applying a simple normalization technique. The calibration map is well approximated as linear. Intrasystem calibration variation was on the order of four percent, which was approximately half of the intersystem variation. Conclusion FFDM systems provide a quantitative output, and the calibration quantities presented here may be used for data acquired on similar FFDM systems. </p...|$|R
