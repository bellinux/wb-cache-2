5|$|The Oliviers {{returned}} to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa {{that same year}} {{as part of a}} revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in an hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode– several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.|$|E

25|$|The 77-minute episode {{shows the}} last day of the Time War, in which the War Doctor (John Hurt) chooses to kill both Daleks and his own race of Time Lords to end the {{destructive}} conflict, paralleling this with a present-day choice by paramilitary organisation UNIT to destroy London rather than allow an alien invasion. Revising the back story, the Doctor succumbs to Clara Oswald's plea to change his mind; and instead, at the last instant of the Time War, he hides his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it. Unfortunately the time distortions incurred causes all but his latest incarnation to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of his changed decision.|$|E
25|$|Kent Heitholt {{was found}} beaten and strangled shortly after 2 am on November 1, 2001, {{in the parking}} lot of the Columbia Daily Tribune, where he worked as a sports editor. Heitholt's murder went unsolved for two years until police {{received}} a tip that a man named Charles Erickson could not remember the evening of the murder and was concerned that he may have been involved with the murder. Erickson, who spent that evening partying with Ferguson, was interrogated by police. Despite initially seeming to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of the evening of the murders, he eventually confessed and implicated Ferguson as well. Ferguson was convicted in the fall of 2005 on the basis of Erickson's testimony as well as the testimony of a building employee.|$|E
25|$|In early 1969, Bonin {{was arrested}} as he {{attempted}} to restrain a 16-year-old youth whom he had lured into his vehicle; he was indicted on five counts of kidnapping, four counts of sodomy, one count of oral copulation, and one count of child molestation against the five youths he had abducted and assaulted or—in {{the case of the}} final youth he had abducted—attempted to assault since the previous November. Bonin pleaded guilty to molestation and forced oral copulation and was sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sexual offender considered amenable to treatment in January 1971. While detained at this hospital, Bonin was subjected to a battery of psychiatric examinations: these examinations revealed that Bonin possessed a higher than average IQ of 121, and displayed traits of manic depression in addition to damage to the prefrontal cortex of his brain—which would likely reduce his ability to restrain any violent impulses; his physical examinations also revealed extensive scars on his head and buttocks, which he had likely sustained in the three years he had been housed at the Connecticut juvenile detention center as a child, although Bonin claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of any such incidents of abuse.|$|E

500|$|After {{a two-month}} trial, Sirhan {{was convicted of}} Robert Kennedy's murder on April 17, 1969, and six days later, he was {{sentence}}d to death. The sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 after the California Supreme Court, in its decision in California v. Anderson, invalidated all pending death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. Since that time, Sirhan has been denied parole fifteen times and is currently confined at the [...] Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in southern San Diego County. Sirhan's lawyers have claimed that he was framed, and Sirhan claims to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of his crime.|$|E
500|$|During the 1980s, many Japanese {{corporations}} {{relied on}} investments to bolster dwindling profits, particularly in its exports {{which had been}} eroded by a strong yen. Toshiro Shimoyama, Olympus president from 1984 to 1993, admitted to the Nikkei industrial daily newspaper in 1986: [...] "When the main business is struggling, we need to earn through zaitech" [...] (meaning [...] ). Olympus invested in financial derivatives and other risky investments to boost profits. However, Shimoyama said he [...] "does not remember" [...] any attempt to conceal losses (tobashi) during his tenure as president: [...] "As president it wasn't the case where all financial reports would come to me, so I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory.</b> During that time Masatoshi Kishimoto was the treasurer ... I wouldn't have heard financial details." [...] Kishimoto, Olympus president from 1993 to 2001, in turn denied involvement in tobashi, and instead suggested possible implication of Hideo Yamada, whom he said he supervised poorly.|$|E

2500|$|Zantzinger was {{initially}} charged with murder. His defense {{was that he}} had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of the attack.

The Project's goal was to create the perfect assassin; to accomplish this, they developed the [...] "Pickman Bridge", a brain implant containing the personality and skills of a trained assassin which could be activated on command. In theory, the two personalities could co-exist in the same mind, completely unaware of one another. The idea was that the assassin could be remotely triggered, carry out his mission, and then revert to the original persona, who would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> {{of what he had}} just done, hence would be immune to interrogation.|$|E
2500|$|Macropsia {{may present}} {{itself as a}} symptom of both frontal lobe {{epilepsy}} and temporal lobe epilepsy, which may actually help in the diagnosis of those diseases. Children who experience nocturnal hallucinations accompanied by macropsia may seek medical care for panic attack disorders and instead are diagnosed with forms of epilepsy. Epilepsy patients may <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of the seizure, but can remember the hallucinations and aura which proceed the attack. Electroencephalography, or EEG imaging, can then be utilized while the patient experiences the episode. It may be subsequently concluded that the EEG is congruent with temporal or frontal lobe seizure. Anxiety and headaches accompany the episodes of visual distortion associated with epilepsy. Valproic acid is used to treat the epilepsy, and may be effective in ending the episodes of macropsia ...|$|E
2500|$|Post-traumatic amnesia is {{generally}} {{due to a}} head injury (example: a fall, {{a knock on the}} head). Traumatic amnesia is often transient, but may be permanent or either anterograde, retrograde, or mixed type. The extent of the period covered by the amnesia is related to the degree of injury and may give an indication of the prognosis for recovery of other functions. [...] Mild trauma, such as a car accident that results in no more than mild whiplash, might cause the occupant of a car to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>memory</b> of the moments just before the accident due to a brief interruption in the short/long-term memory transfer mechanism. The sufferer may also lose knowledge of who people are. Having longer periods of amnesia or consciousness after an injury may be an indication that recovery from remaining concussion symptoms will take much longer.|$|E
