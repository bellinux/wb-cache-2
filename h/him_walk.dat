5|$|Georgi Kinkladze {{was born}} on 6 July 1973 in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. As a child, {{he lived in the}} Didube {{district}} of the city with his father, Robinzon (an engineer), his mother Khatuna (a teacher) and his elder sister. Robinzon was keen to see his son succeed as a footballer, sometimes making <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> around the family home on his knees to strengthen his legs, and enrolled him for Dinamo Tbilisi's junior side when he was six years old. Khatuna disapproved of some of her husband's methods, instead taking Georgi to lessons in mtiuluri, a traditional Georgian ballet. Over the next few years, Kinkladze played in Dinamo Tbilisi's youth teams, progressing as far as the reserve team, where he played alongside Shota Arveladze, who would later become his teammate at both senior and international level.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman {{first went}} to his {{official}} home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to prevent them falling into Dutch hands. His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, {{a small group of}} soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, Bantul. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance and to ask his wife for jewellery to sell and help fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to Wonogiri. Before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases. Meanwhile, Alfiah and the children were ordered to stay in the Kraton. Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23 December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to Ponorogo, where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a kyai and Islamic religious leader; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help <b>him</b> <b>walk,</b> although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a litter. They then continued east.|$|E
5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

25|$|In a {{story that}} echoes some of the earlier tales, Ruth's son Erwin C. Ruth {{was said to have}} learned of the Peralta mine from a man called Pedro Gonzales (or Gonzalez). According to the story, in about 1912 Erwin C. Ruth gave some legal aid to Gonzales, saving him from almost certain imprisonment. In gratitude, Gonzales told Erwin about the Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains, and gave him some antique maps of the site (Gonzales claimed to be descended from the Peralta family on his mother's side). Erwin passed the {{information}} to his father Adolph, who had a long-standing interest in lost mines and amateur exploration. The elder Ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost Pegleg mine in California. He had metal pins in his leg, and used a cane to help <b>him</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jade visits her bed-ridden {{father in}} the Emerald City, and offers to use her {{abilities}} to help <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it {{could result in the}} deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams {{to attract the attention of}} the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Krabs has a {{distinct}} manner of walking; when he moves, he moves his feet very quickly and he is drawn {{as if he has}} more than two legs. When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle with the intention of making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, [...] "I animated Mr. Krabs' little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> like a crab." [...] Steven Hillenburg approved of the walk after Wiese demonstrated it on a pencil test machine.|$|E

2500|$|When he was {{six years}} old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a {{neighborhood}} store. His mother made <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother told his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse, yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations {{that he was a}} [...] "sissy" [...] and a [...] "Mama's boy" [...] who would [...] "probably grow up queer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and I had <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, I told the girl to close the door and said, [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E
60|$|Tyrrel, {{glad to be}} {{released}} from the examination to which his landlady's curiosity had without ceremony subjected <b>him,</b> <b>walked</b> into the parlour, where he was presently joined by Mr. Touchwood, newly attired, and in high spirits.|$|R

50|$|The Cubs {{went with}} the overworked Borowy, who lasted just three batters, each of whom singled. Paul Derringer {{replaced}} <b>him,</b> <b>walked</b> Jimmy Outlaw with the bases full, then watched Paul Richards clear the bases with a three-run double.|$|R
2500|$|Novak {{was born}} in Joliet, Illinois, the son of Jane Sanders and Maurice Novak, a {{chemical}} engineer. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Ukraine, and his mother's family was from Lithuania. Novak's parents were secular Jews who had little interaction with their local Jewish community and rarely attended religious services. Neighbors considered Novak's family to be Polish. Novak suffered from chronic bronchitis through his early childhood, which led his mother to drive him {{to and from school}} instead of letting <b>him</b> <b>walk.</b> Because of the constant family attention, his cousins mockingly called him [...] "Baby Jesus". Novak also loved to tease, offend, and shock his family from an early age, and he later compared himself to French rebel Bertran de Born.|$|E
2500|$|Tudor {{was born}} in Vladimiri, Gorj County (in the region of Oltenia) {{in a family of}} landed peasants (mazili); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to Craiova, in service to boyar Ioan Glogoveanu, where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the Greek language. He became {{administrator}} of the boyar's estate and, in 1806, was named vătaf (leader of the local militias) at Cloșani. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the Phanariotes. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1911, {{while walking}} home from a banquet, Stewart stopped at a {{restaurant}} to greet some friends inside. [...] As {{he stood in the}} doorway, a Portland Police officer ordered him to move on and threatened to arrest him if he refused to comply. [...] Believing he had done no wrong, Stewart objected and the policeman arrested him and made <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> a mile on his prosthetic leg to the police station where he was booked for drunkenness. [...] Authorities refused to charge Stewart, and the next day he filed a complaint of assault and battery with the district attorney, who issued an arrest warrant against the officer. At the hearing the officer maintained that Stewart was very inebriated while Stewart produced numerous witnesses from the banquet arguing the opposite. [...] The complaint was dismissed and Stewart appealed to the Mayor of Portland and publicized the incident in The Oregon Journal. [...] Whether there was any further action is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Although it {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Butler had recommended Chris Thomas as their producer. Thomas was more experienced and had previously worked with punk rock bands The Pretenders and the Sex Pistols; however Suede's label Nude Records dismissed the idea, saying he was too expensive. Nude's owner Saul Galpern claimed that the guitarist became impossible to reason with and also made threats to him and Buller. Buller claims he received phone calls where he heard something akin to scratching knives. Butler issued the band and their management an ultimatum: either they sacked Buller, or he would walk out. The rest of the band refused to comply with Butler's demands and decided to let <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> out before the record was finished. Butler insisted he was kicked out the band, as he turned up to the studio one day to find he was not allowed in. He went {{back the next day}} to pick up his guitar and was told through the intercom that his guitar would be left in the street for him. Suede's manager Charlie Charlton made a final attempt to reach consensus between the two parties, however during a tense phone conversation the final words Butler uttered to Anderson were along the lines of [...] "you're a fucking cunt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In , Snake Eyes is {{a member}} of G.I. Joe. He was given the name [...] "Hebi no me" [...] ("Snake Eyes") by his Arashikage clan sensei, Hard Master, because he {{possesses}} the [...] "steely gaze of a serpent". He cannot speak after having his throat punctured, and just shows up for special missions when called by Scarlett, who can [...] "translate" [...] what he is thinking. He is not used to teamwork, but now that he has joined G.I. Joe, his sense of honor and morality would not let <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> away. In the episode [...] "Dreadnoks Rising", Zartan takes off his visor but puts it back on and says, [...] "You need it more than I do". Snake Eyes' wolf Timber made an appearance in the episode [...] "White Out", where he was rescued by Snake Eyes from a bear trap, before they were assaulted by Storm Shadow and Shadow-Vipers; at the end, Snake Eyes asks Snow Job to watch Timber until he returns. In the episode [...] "Revelations, Part 1", Scarlett learns that Snake Eyes briefly met her father, and promised him to look after his daughter, and he shows signs of having feelings for her. During the time when Snake Eyes still spoke, before his throat injury in the episodes [...] "Return of the Arashikage, Parts 1-2", Snake Eyes was voiced by Danny Cooksey.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa's departing storyline {{revolved}} around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking {{her daughter to}} live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: [...] "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark— passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, [...] "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{episode was}} {{initiated}} by connecting Adriana Sharnol Curaçaoan hit to {{left before the}} pitcher releases Edgar Perez, who immediately gave <b>him</b> <b>walked</b> Carlos Sievers and allowed an RBI double to Hernando Arredondo, with which he entered the register Adriana, then Oscar Ramirez was hit to load the bases.|$|R
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear <b>him</b> <b>walk</b> away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

60|$|When he {{came out}} it was exactly {{as if he had}} been in custody, for beside <b>him</b> <b>walked</b> a stout man with a big black beard, who, save that he wore spectacles, might have been a policeman, and in whom at a second glance I {{recognised}} the highest contemporary enterprise.|$|R
60|$|The idea {{of being}} thus {{vicariously}} present {{in the person of}} his brother seemed a sufficient excuse.
