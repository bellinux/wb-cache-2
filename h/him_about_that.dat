25|$|The {{participants}} {{who refused to}} administer the final shocks neither insisted that the experiment be terminated, nor left the room to check {{the health of the}} victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist Philip Zimbardo asked <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> point.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Insole, his {{one-time}} captain at Essex, {{described him}} thus: [...] "Trevor {{was quite a}} stroppy lad in his early cricketing years, {{and a bit of}} a rebel. He was a very intense character – we used to tease <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> in the dressing room, and he did mellow over the years." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} the hero holding the villain up high above his head, and {{throwing}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> carelessly that we have felt afraid he would break something with him.|$|E
60|$|The boy's delight knew no bounds. He {{should tell}} <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> in St. Bertin.|$|R
60|$|Barney {{leaped to}} the other's side and {{grasping}} {{him by the}} shoulders wheeled <b>him</b> <b>about</b> so <b>that</b> he faced the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{certainly}} not. Talk with <b>him</b> <b>about</b> anything <b>that</b> interests you. Be {{pleasant to}} him. Can't {{you see that}} he's going on to Rotterdam on our account?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as I say," [...] he repeated. [...] "Tell him to come. Perhaps I {{may have}} more to say to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> other matter than I choose to say to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> money," [...] said the vice-consul, dryly. [...] "It will {{be handed over}} to him when the estate is settled, if there isn't enough to pay the bequests without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is where}} the old pirate who made the map lives," [...] he whispered, {{as he reached the}} door. [...] "If he’s got {{anything}} to say I’ll tackle <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Now, pull yourself together!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would go," [...] {{said the}} rector's wife, [...] "only I {{know he would}} require me to agree with <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Harry. <b>That,</b> of course, I cannot do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no. If he'd {{asked for}} senna and salts, the waiter wouldn't have showed any surprise. By-the-by, you touched <b>him</b> up <b>about</b> <b>that</b> poor girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--no--not so fast; ye see there's two to that bargain yet. You see, Joe, {{he never}} said a word to me, but took and courted the gal out of his own head; and when I come to know, says I, 'Joe,' says I, 'that 'ere gal won't do for me;' and I took and tell'd <b>him,</b> then, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> 'ere old fence, and all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> old mill, and them medders of mine; and I tell'd <b>him,</b> too, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> 'ere lot of Susan's; and I should like to know, now, deacon, how that lot {{business}} is a going to turn out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he did," [...] said Cap'n Bill. [...] "We {{must ask}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{when we see}} him. But I guess the ol' boy's mem'ry is failin', an' he can't be {{depended}} on for pertic'lars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't fool him on much," [...] {{said one}} of the persons who met <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time. [...] "He would take {{precious}} little for granted. He wanted to know the how of everything, and he wasn't satisfied until he did know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} {{interview}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> reward," [...] Charley explained, as we rapidly over-hauled the oyster-bed owner. [...] "Neil will be delayed {{here for a}} week, and you and I {{might as well be}} doing something in the meantime. What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Loved him! Is there {{anything}} in <b>him</b> or <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a woman could love? Is he not a poor social stick;--a bit of half-dead wood, good to make a post of, if one wants a post? I did want a post so sorely then!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I couldn't bear to {{have him}} think I was better than I really was, or let him care for me unless I told <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> miserable old affair." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she told}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the water <b>that</b> had {{run along the}} nose of the old four-wheeler man.|$|R
6000|$|... "What an {{extraordinary}} thing it is--I {{went all the}} way out to White Plains that afternoon to find Fillmore and tackle <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and I didn't say a word about it. And I haven't seen or been able to get hold of him since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} Allen will {{have had to}} put the kiddies to bed," [...] she said. [...] "Christina, as you might have borne in mind, goes over to Branstock's every evening. Anyway, you'll drive across and see <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> team {{as soon as you}} can; come to supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In course not," [...] replied Uncle Ben with {{a slight}} {{stiffening}} of wounded pride. [...] "On'y yourself, Mr. Ford, and the young feller Stacey from the bank--ez was obligated to know it. In fact, I wos kalkilatin' {{to ask you to}} help me talk to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> yer boundary land." ...|$|E
2500|$|One-time friend Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins wrote {{lyrics to}} the Massive Attack song [...] "Teardrop", {{thinking}} of Buckley's death, stating: [...] "That was so weird ... I'd got letters out and I was thinking <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> <b>That</b> song's kind of <b>about</b> <b>him</b> – <b>that's</b> {{how it feels}} to me anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Feemy {{knows she}} needn't ask <b>about</b> that; <b>that's</b> {{one of the}} things I always take care of. But where's Thady, Mr. Macdermot? I wanted to speak to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Keegan, <b>that</b> sworn friend of his:" [...] and Ussher began to make himself {{comfortable}} with the hot water, sugar, &c.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{receiving}} ongoing {{death threats}} and having explosives hung around her neck, she [...] "would talk with <b>him</b> <b>about</b> things <b>that</b> interested <b>him,</b> which in his eyes, {{made her a}} person, not just a captive. She began to gain his trust." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's gettin' a hunch that I'll {{tell him}} of some shadow hoverin' black over White Slides," [...] soliloquized Wade. [...] "Maybe--maybe so. But I don't see any yet.... Strange {{how a man}} will say what he didn't start out to say. Now, I started to tell <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> amazin' dog Fox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{just what}} I feel is so jolly about him; {{no one would}} ever get on his nerves. I do think we've got too many nerves, don't you? Here's your brother-in-law. He's such an uncommon-looking man; I want to have a talk with <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little model. A country girl, wasn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Once, {{and once}} only, Frank {{said a word}} to her that was not exactly brotherly. They were walking {{together}} down the footpath by the mill, and Olga had been talking to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> great terror, when Frank asked her, in a quiet voice, [...] "Olga, why don't you try to get a divorce from that horrible Niaz?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She would help. Father's old, Kit, {{and might}} be indulged. You would try not to hurt him, and could consult <b>him</b> <b>about</b> things <b>that</b> didn't matter. I think he'd be {{satisfied}} if you let him imagine he had some control." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fraser {{wrote the}} song's lyrics. While {{recording}} the song on 29 May 1997, {{she found out}} that her once-close friend, Jeff Buckley, had drowned. [...] "That was so weird ... I'd got letters out and I was thinking <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> <b>That</b> song's kind of <b>about</b> <b>him</b> - <b>that's</b> {{how it feels to}} me anyway." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are stories}} <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he {{killed more than}} 1000 people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} misjudge <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> work of his, anyhow," [...] said Melville. [...] "He's a man rather divided against himself." [...] He added abruptly, [...] "We all are." [...] He {{recovered}} {{himself from the}} generality. [...] "It's vague, I admit, a sort of vague wish to do something decent, you know, that he has----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you go down}} to the Point with me this evening, Mrs. Blythe? I'll ask <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> life-book myself, but I {{want you}} to tell him that you told me the story of lost Margaret and ask him if he will let me use it as a thread of romance with which to weave the stories of the life-book into a {{harmonious}} whole." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} family-tree-man, {{whose name was}} Brandish, {{in a small room}} not too clean, over a shop not far from St. Paul's Churchyard. He had another business, which related to patent poison for flies, and at first he thought I had come to see <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but when he found out I wanted to ask him about my family tree his face brightened up.|$|E
60|$|Others {{also said}} things <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he heard or {{understood}} imperfectly.|$|R
6000|$|And Jolly thought: 'It's for Holly to let <b>him</b> know <b>about</b> <b>that</b> chap. If she doesn't, {{it means}} she doesn't want him told, and I should be sneaking. Anyway, I've stopped it. I'd better leave well alone!' ...|$|R
50|$|Michael Bentley {{has written}} a children's book <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> was {{published}} in 2012.|$|R
