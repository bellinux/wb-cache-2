40|$|In {{the past}} decade a sea change {{has taken place in}} trade {{policies}} in Latin America: within a few years, most of the region's economies have changed from restrictive to open policies. But unlike trade liberalization in Europe, most trade barriers in Latin America have been reduced unilaterally. Recently bilateral or multilateral agreements have been considered, especially preferential tradeagreements within the region. The author evaluates the relevance and desirability of multilateral free trade agreements (such as NAFTA) for the Latin American continent and the Caribbean, with an emphasis on how they affect trade flows. Is a preferential trade agreement among some Latin American countries more or less likely to be meaningful than others - important in intensity of impact, or beneficial, or both? The evidence strongly suggests little likelihood that these agreements will succeed in Latin America. Paradoxically, the intense liberalization in recent years has made it less likely that such agreements would be beneficial - except possibly for agreements between some countries and Brazil, Mexico, or (to a lesser extent) Argentina. When the level of tariffs and nontariff barriers is already low, a preferential agreement is more likely to have an adverse impact than a beneficial one (although in any case only a slight impact). Between countries, the patterns of exports and imports are similar, suggesting a potential for trade diversion. Most countries would benefit from a preferential agreement with the United States, however. And U. <b>S.</b> <b>agreements</b> with blocks of Latin American countries are no more beneficial to those countries than are U. <b>S.</b> <b>agreements</b> with individual countries.

40|$|In HOLLYWOOD AND ANTI-SEMITISM (2001), I {{argued that}} both CROSSFIRE (RKO, 1946) and GENTLEMAN 2 ̆ 7 <b>S</b> <b>AGREEMENT</b> (20 th Century-Fox, 1947) {{incidentally}} {{alluded to the}} Holocaust and Nazi anti-Semitism by showing anti Semitism to be a psycho-pathological disorder and 2 ̆ 2 a nasty personal habit 2 ̆ 2 (281), respectively, but with the same result of having a corrupting and corrosive social influence. In this paper, I attempt to situate both of these films {{within the context of}} the Hollywood social problem film. While recent discussion has emphasized the film noir elements within CROSSFIRE, less attention has considered the way in which both CROSSFIRE and GENTLEMAN 2 ̆ 7 <b>S</b> <b>AGREEMENT</b> gain legitimacy through the conventions of the social problem genre. In this respect, both films continue an ethic of assimilationist pluralism where the few bad apples of socially aberrant behavior should not be left to contaminate the basic decency of American democracy. As Parker Tyler observed in 1950, both films show 2 ̆ 2 explicit recognition of the 2 ̆ 7 race prejudice 2 ̆ 7 which, with respect to Jews, is so irrelevant in the social strongholds of professionalism 2 ̆ 2 (168). As both films suggest, the injustice of anti-Semitism is not that it is directed against those who appear too Jewish, but that it is directed against those Jews who already have so assimilated to an American ideal that they do not at all appear to be Jewish. To address how these films ultimately conformed to the social problem film genre in this particular depiction of anti-Semitism, I use a reception-based approach in considering primary historical documents from the Production Code Administration, film reviews, and newspaper display ads for both of these films...|$|R

The findings suggest that greater fear of sex offenders and acceptance of misinformation were predictive of more support of sex offender management policies. Research has found that these policies are costly and ineffective in promoting community safety. Effective and efficient policy development occurs when policy is based on evidence.

40|$|Efforts {{to ensure}} that {{intellectual}} property rights are respected and protected world-wide have met increasing resistance by critics who see extreme imbalances in {{the costs and benefits}} of implementing stronger intellectual property protection. The WTO <b>s</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) attracts particular criticism as an enforceable multilateral embodiment of these efforts. While few disagree that developed countries stand to benefit more in the short term from TRIPS implementation than developing countries, precisely estimating associated costs and benefits is challenging. This paper comments on an approach to estimating the indirect costs of implementing TRIPS proposed by McCalman (2001) and argues that the approach overestimates the costs born by developing countries. Specifically, this overestimation is due primarily to an inadequate representation of the TRIPS Agreement and a counterfactual assumption that countries would not have strengthened their intellectual property policies in the absence of the TRIPS Agreement. ...|$|R
