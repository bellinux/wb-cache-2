DNA profiling was also able to distinguish Carignan as a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> from other varieties known as Bovale (including Graciano which is known on Sardinia as Bovale Sardo and Bovale Cagnulari) as well as the Valencia wine grape Bobal which is sometimes field blended in the Cariñena (DO) with Carignan.|$|E

500|$|There {{is also a}} <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> of ASL used by the Black Deaf community. Black ASL {{evolved as}} a result of racially {{segregated}} schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf. Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure. While African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs. Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space. Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAVE; for instance, the AAVE idiom [...] "I feel you" [...] is calqued into Black ASL.|$|E

500|$|The variety Lactifluus volemus var. flavus was {{described}} by Alexander H. Smith and Lexemuel Ray Hesler in their 1979 monograph of North American Lactarius species. This rare variety, found in the southeastern United States (ranging from South Carolina to Florida and extending west to Texas), has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development. It also has slightly smaller spores than the regular variety: 6.5–9.0 by 6–8µm. Some authors have considered the rarely collected L.volemus var. oedematopus, found in central and southern Europe, to be a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> distinguished from the common variety by a darker reddish-brown cap and a swollen stem. This assessment is not universally accepted, possibly because it falls {{within the range of}} morphological variation shown by the main variety. [...] L.volemus var. asiaticus was named in 2004 based on Vietnamese specimens; associating with Khasi pine (Pinus khasya), it has small, dull brown, velvety fruit bodies. In general, little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to the several varieties of L.volemus that have been proposed.|$|E
500|$|Cuttings of Carménère were {{imported}} by Chilean growers from Bordeaux {{during the}} 19th century, {{where they were}} frequently confused with Merlot vines. They modeled their wineries after those in France and in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carménère grape, were planted in the valleys around Santiago. Thanks to central Chile's minimal rainfall {{during the growing season}} and the protection of the country's natural boundaries, growers produced healthier crops of Carménère and there was no spread of phylloxera. During most of the 20th century Carménère was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlot markedly different properties from those of Merlot produced elsewhere. Chilean growers believed that this grape was a clone of Merlot and was known as Merlot selection or Merlot Peumal (after the Peumo Valley in Chile). In 1994, a researcher at Montpellier's school of Oenology found that [...] "an earlier-ripening vine was Bordeaux Carménère, not Merlot". The Chilean Department of Agriculture officially recognized Carménère as a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> in 1998. Today, Carménère grows chiefly in the Colchagua Valley, Rapel Valley, and Maipo Province.|$|E

60|$|In the {{eleventh}} chapter, abundant proofs were given that foreign pollen occasionally affects {{in a direct}} manner the mother-plant. Thus, when Gallesio fertilised an orange-flower with pollen from the lemon, the fruit bore stripes of perfectly characterised lemon-peel. With peas, several observers have seen the colour of the seed-coats and even of the pod directly affected by the pollen of a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety.</b> So it {{has been with the}} fruit of the apple, which consists of the modified calyx and upper part of the flower-stalk. In ordinary cases these parts are wholly formed by the mother-plant. We here see that the formative elements included within the male element or pollen of one variety can affect and hybridise, not the part which they are properly adapted to affect, namely, the ovules, but the partially-developed tissues of a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> or species. We are thus brought half-way towards a graft- hybrid, in which the formative elements included within the tissues of one individual combine with those included in the tissues of a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> or species, thus giving rise to a new and intermediate form, independently of the male or female sexual organs.|$|E
60|$|Flowers {{on plants}} {{of the second}} self-fertilised {{generation}} were crossed with pollen from a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> or fresh stock, and others were again self-fertilised.

But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life--immortality--and cognizant of all secrets but the one, act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition:--indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created--but that SPACE itself--that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows--blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.|$|E
6000|$|Professor Bain(38) distinguishes {{two kinds}} of Propositions of Co-existence. “In the one kind, account is taken of Place; they may be {{described}} as propositions of Order in Place.” In the other kind, the co-existence which is predicated is termed by Mr. Bain Co-inherence of Attributes. “This is a <b>distinct</b> <b>variety</b> of Propositions of Co-existence. Instead of an arrangement in place with numerical intervals, we have the concurrence {{of two or more}} attributes or powers in the same part or locality. A mass of gold contains, in every atom, the concurring attributes that mark the substance—weight, hardness, color, lustre, incorrosibility, etc. An animal, besides having parts situated in place, has co-inhering functions in the same parts, exerted by the very same masses and molecules of its substance.... The Mind, which affords no Propositions of Order in Place, has co-inhering functions. We affirm mind to contain Feeling, Will, and Thought, not in local separation, but in commingling exercise. The concurring properties of minerals, of plants, and of the bodily and the mental structure of animals, are united in affirmations of co-inherence.” ...|$|E
