5000|$|The {{larval stage}} of C. catalpae {{is known as}} the Catalpa or Catawba Worm. When first hatching, the larvae are a very pale color, but become darker toward the last instars. The yellow {{caterpillars}} will usually have a dark, black stripe down their back along with black dots along their sides. There is also a [...] "pale" [...] phase where the black striping is not as prevalent or missing altogether and a shade of white has replaced it. They grow to a length of about 5 cm and feed on the leaves of the Northern Catalpa and, more commonly, the Southern Catalpa, also known as Catawba or <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>trees.</b> They are highly desired by fishermen as bait. Southern dialective fishermen's nomenclature is commonly [...] "Catalfie Worms." [...] The customary use is to bite off or otherwise remove the head, then turn the worm inside out on the hook.|$|R

[...] The tree mentioned in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006 was a reference to the <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> (pictured) that was planted in St James Square in Monmouth about 1900. Properly known as Catalpa bignonioides, it is a native of the southeastern United States. At the time of the unveiling of the Monmouth War Memorial (pictured) in 1921, the Catalpa was already a mature tree. In 1946, a rod was installed to support the main limbs of the tree. The <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> is considered by the Monmouth Action Group to be [...] "one of the best examples of the species in Britain." [...] It is thought to be one of the oldest and largest specimens in the United Kingdom. The <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> is positioned behind the war memorial and surrounded by lawn, with an adjacent formal planting of flowers. The cenotaph, tree, lawn, and garden are enclosed by railings.|$|E

50|$|St James Square is a {{historic}} square in the town centre of Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales. It {{is located at the}} eastern end of Whitecross Street, within the medieval town walls. The area features the Monmouth War Memorial and the controversial, historic <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree.</b> In addition, in 2010, the square was the site of discovery of the first Mesolithic artefacts in Monmouth. St James Square is lined with numerous listed buildings.|$|E
50|$|In February 2006, it was {{reported}} that the Monmouth Archaeology Group and Monmouth Action Group had arranged for another (fourth) expert to investigate the health of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree.</b> Arborist David Lonsdale advised that any risk posed by the Catalpa could be diminished with a two-fold approach: cutting back the top of the tree and supporting the main branches. The results of the investigation were communicated to the Monmouthshire County Council. The <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> at St James Square was of particular interest due to both its size and its status as one of the oldest specimens of Catalpa in the United Kingdom. The opinion of the arborist was that the value of the Catalpa merited the expense of inspection and arbor care. In addition, it was proposed that financing of the arbor work could be accomplished by utilizing the funds that had initially been targeted for felling the old tree and planting a new specimen. Lonsdale cautioned that the health of the tree would eventually deteriorate, despite treatment.|$|E
50|$|Cory Lodge {{was built}} in 1924-5 with money given to the University by Reginald Cory, an alumnus of Trinity College, Cambridge and was {{originally}} used as the residence of the Director of the Botanic Garden. Adjacent to Cory Lodge is a superb specimen of Catalpa speciosa, an <b>Indian</b> <b>bean</b> <b>tree</b> from North America, with white flowers followed by long slender fruits. On the north wall {{of the house is}} a specimen of Ginkgo biloba, the Chinese maidenhair tree, trained as an espalier since 1987.|$|E

In a 2-year experiment on shading, Parkia biglobosa was “found to have suppressive effects on vegetative growth and yield of pearl millet in both years.” Eggplant yields were also suppressed by trees to between one third and one {{tenth of the}} yield in controlled plots, which themselves were damaged by rain. Despite this, chilli pepper yields (which were also affected by rain in the controlled plots) increased by up to 150% under the canopy of the locust <b>bean</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R

It is crossed by several other paths which carry heavy pedestrian traffic between various town centre areas. The churchyard contains a number of significant trees, including a well-known 150-year old <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> (Catalpa bignonioides) that was thought, in 2007, to be unlikely to survive but has since sprouted new growth.|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{are some}} lovely {{spots in the}} town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war {{memorial}} {{in the shadow of}} a romantic-looking tree." [...] This is the description of St James Square (pictured) in Monmouth, Wales that appeared in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006. The war memorial mentioned is the Monmouth War Memorial that was installed in the square in 1921 and was the work of sculptor W. Clarke of Llandaff. The [...] "romantic-looking tree" [...] is a reference to the Catalpa or <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> that was planted on the square in about 1900.|$|E
50|$|The fourth expert's {{evaluation}} of the Catalpa's condition met with a positive reception at the Monmouthshire County Council. The council worked with the Monmouth Town Council and Monmouth Action Group, and looked into performing the remedial arbor care. Treatment was undertaken, including crown reduction and general pruning that were completed by April 2006. In addition, temporary cable props had been placed by that month to support and strengthen the tree. Estimates for supporting rods were obtained: £1500 for stainless steel and £3000 for oak. Outside funding was sought to defray {{the expense of the}} tree props. Later, metal supports (pictured) were installed under some large branches of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree.</b>|$|E

50|$|St James Square in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales is {{the site}} of a {{historic}} Indian Bean Tree.The Catalpa bignonioides, a native of the southeastern United States, was planted in the square about 1900. It was joined by the Monmouth War Memorial in 1921. After more than one hundred years of presiding over the square, the tree became the focus of controversy when it was condemned by the Monmouthshire County Council in 2005. The decision was met with fierce community opposition. The parties involved resolved their differences in 2006, and the tree received treatment, albeit some of it unauthorized. By 2011, the <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> in St James Square was flourishing.|$|E
50|$|The Monmouth War Memorial {{is located}} in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales. It is {{positioned}} in the centre of St. James' Square, within the roundabout of Whitecross Street, Old Dixton Road, and St. James' Street. The Catalpa tree behind the cenotaph was imported from North America and planted about 1900. At {{the time of the}} unveiling of the monument in 1921, the Catalpa was already a mature tree. There are formal plantings on three sides of the memorial. The monument, plantings, and adjacent lawn are surrounded by railings. The <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree,</b> however, was condemned by the Monmouthshire City Council. Opponents of the decision to fell the tree hired a professional arboriculturalist who concluded that the tree could be treated to extend its life.|$|E
50|$|Whitecross Street is the eastward {{extension}} of the now-pedestrianised Church Street. As it extends eastward and slightly to the north, the road intersects with Monk Street. Beyond the intersection, Whitecross Street continues to the east, dipping slightly to the south. It terminates at the roundabout encircling the triangular St James Square. The square is remarkable for an <b>Indian</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Tree</b> (Catalpa), {{a native of the}} southeastern United States. St James Square also features the Monmouth War Memorial, designed by W. Clarke of Llandaff and installed in front of the Catalpa in 1921. On some modern-day maps, the eastern leg of Whitecross Street, from the intersection with Monk Street to its termination at the roundabout encircling St James Square, is also referred to as St James Square, such that some buildings in Whitecross Street have two addresses.|$|E
