This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral <b>head</b> <b>movement.</b> This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including <b>head</b> <b>movement</b> and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

The relationship between sleepiness and <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> is poorly investigated. The pattern of <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> over time {{was investigated in}} a laboratory study with ten subjects either sleepdeprived or rested. <b>Head</b> <b>movements</b> were obtained by an inclinometer placed on the subject’s forehead, and the recording was continuous. Results show that subjects when sleep-deprived moved their head more and had more extreme <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> compared to when rested. An increase of the velocity {{and the number of}} extreme <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> over time were noted when the subjects were sleep-deprived and when rested. The increase of <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> was more linear over time in the rested condition, whereas in sleep-deprived conditions most of the increase appeared during the first hour. No significant differences of between forward–backward movements and left–right movements could be found. When rested, the changes in <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> correlated with ratings of sleepiness, EEG activity, and heart rate variability. <b>Head</b> <b>movements</b> can be a used as an indicator of sleepiness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{simulate}} direct-digital cephalometric procedures and to record the <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> of probands. This study was prompted by the Committee for Insurance Matters of the Swiss National Invalidity Insurance which does not accept scanned digital cephalometric radiographs as a basis for its decisions. The reason for this is the required scanning time of several seconds during which even slight <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> can lead to kinetic blurring and landmark displacement. Incorrect angular measurements may result. By means of a Sirognathograph and a cephalostat of non-ferromagnetic material, the <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> of a total of 264 subjects were recorded in three dimensions, with a scanning time of up to 25 seconds. In a second series, the influence of a chin support to reduce <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> was also tested. The results of the first series of tests showed that, with an increasing scan time, movements became greater, mostly in the sagittal plane, and that maximum displacements could occur already at the start of the recording. With a scan time of 10 seconds the median movement amplitude in the vertical dimension was 2. 14 mm. The second series of tests revealed a significant reduction in <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> in all dimensions owing to an additional stabilizing chin support.

40|$|Flying insects use {{compensatory}} <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> {{to stabilize}} gaze. Like other optokinetic responses, these movements can reduce image displacement, motion, and misalignment, and simplify the optic flow field. Because gaze is imperfectly stabilized in insects, we hypothesised that compensatory <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> serve {{to extend the}} range of velocities of self-motion that the visual system encodes. We tested this by measuring <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> in hawkmoths Hyles lineata responding to full-field visual stimuli of differing oscillation amplitudes, oscillation frequencies, and spatial frequencies. We used frequency-domain system identification techniques to characterise the head's roll response, and simulated how this would have affected {{the output of the}} motion vision system, modelled as a computational array of Reichardt detectors. The moths' <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> were modulated to allow encoding of both fast and slow self-motion, effectively quadrupling the working range of the visual system for flight control. By using its own output to drive compensatory <b>head</b> <b>movements,</b> the motion vision system thereby works as an adaptive sensor, which will be especially beneficial in nocturnal species with inherently slow vision. Studies of the ecology of motion vision must therefore consider the tuning of motion-sensitive interneurons {{in the context of the}} closed-loop systems in which they function...|$|R

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent <b>head</b> <b>movement.</b> This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations.

40|$|We report neck muscle {{activity}} and <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by electrical {{stimulation of the}} superior colliculus (SC) in head-unrestrained monkeys. Recording neck electromyography (EMG) circumvents complications arising from the head's inertia and the kinetics of muscle force generation and allows precise assessment of the neuromuscular drive to the head plant. This study served two main purposes. First, we sought to test the predictions made in the companion paper of a parallel drive from the SC onto neck muscles. Low-current, long-duration stimulation evoked both neck EMG responses and <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> either without or prior to gaze shifts, testifying to a SC drive to neck muscles that is independent of gaze-shift initiation. However, gaze-shift initiation was linked to a transient additional EMG response and head acceleration, confirming {{the presence of a}} SC drive to neck muscles that is dependent on gaze-shift initiation. We forward a conceptual neural architecture and suggest that this parallel drive provides the oculomotor system with the flexibility to orient the eyes and head independently or together, depending on the behavioral context. Second, we compared the EMG responses evoked by SC stimulation to those that accompanied volitional <b>head</b> <b>movements.</b> We found characteristic features in the underlying pattern of evoked neck EMG that were not observed during volitional <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> in spite of the seemingly natural kinematics of evoked <b>head</b> <b>movements.</b> These features included reciprocal patterning of EMG activity on the agonist and antagonist muscles during stimulation, a poststimulation increase in the activity of antagonist muscles, and synchronously evoked responses on agonist and antagonist muscles regardless of initial horizontal head position. These results demonstrate that the electrically evoked SC drive to the head cannot be considered as a neural replicate of the SC drive during volitional <b>head</b> <b>movements</b> and place important new constraints on the interpretation of electrically evoked <b>head</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
