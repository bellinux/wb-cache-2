5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, as <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1920s.

These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E

From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|The first large Maya cities {{developed}} in Petén as <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Middle Preclassic (c.600–350BC), and Petén formed {{the heartland of}} the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c.AD250–900).

In 1441, Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 12thcentury. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.|$|E
5|$|The nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel {{dates to}} the 11th century, but it is {{believed}} that there was a place of worship on Herm as <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 6th century, although it hasn't been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and {{appears to have been a}} monastery during medieval times.

In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.|$|E

The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E
