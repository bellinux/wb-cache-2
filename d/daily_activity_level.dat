40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} {{study showed that}} 6 months after total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), patients reported having less difficulty with daily activities, showed better functional capacity, and performed activities in their natural environment faster compared to preoperatively. However, their actual <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> was not significantly improved. Six months is a rather short follow-up period and the discrepancy in recovery among different aspects of functioning might be explained by this limited duration of follow-up. The objective {{of the present study}} was to examine the recovery of different aspects of physical functioning at a follow-up nearly 4 years after THA/TKA. Special attention was given to the actual <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> and whether it had increased 4 years after THA/TKA compared to 6 months postoperatively. Seventy-seven (35 hip, 42 knee) patients who were measured preoperatively and postoperatively (6 months after surgery) in a {{previous study}} were invited to participate; 44 patients (23 hip, 21 knee) agreed to participate. The 4 -year follow-up data were compared with the preoperative and 6 -month postoperative data. The <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> after 4 years was found to be actually lower than at 6 months post-surgery (128 min vs. 138 min activity per 24 h; p-value 0. 48). However, the patients continued to improve in other aspects of physical functioning. In conclusion, 4 -year post-surgery patients continued to improve on perceived physical functioning, capacity, and performance of activities in daily life. However, even in this relatively healthy study population, patients did not adopt a more active lifestyle 4 years after surgery...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is {{generally}} associated with low {{physical activity in}} patients with various chronic medical conditions. However, such an association has not been reported among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate whether <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> is associated with fatigue in patients with RA, and whether pain, disability, coping, and/or cognition are associated with the level of daily activity. METHODS: Patients with RA who visited our outpatient clinic were recruited consecutively. Fatigue severity was measured using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS 20). Physical activity was measured for 14 consecutive days using an ankle-worn actometer. The <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> of each patient was calculated, and each patient was classified as having a low or high activity level with respect to the group average. Data were analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were included in the analysis; 25 % had a low activity level and 75 % had a high activity level. A regression analysis revealed that higher activity levels were associated with reduced fatigue (P = 0. 008). The mean +/- SD CIS fatigue score was 30. 9 +/- 12. 3 among the patients with a high activity level and 35. 7 +/- 12. 8 among the patients with a low activity level (P = 0. 03). Pain, disability, coping, and cognition were not associated significantly with <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> CONCLUSION: Among patients with RA, a higher level of daily physical activity was associated with reduced levels of fatigue. This relationship was not explained by differences in sex, age, disease duration, pain, disability, or other fatigue-related factors...|$|E

To assess whether the severity and functional consequences of muscular impairment are disease specific, we compared skeletal muscle function, body composition, and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> relative to exercise capacity {{between these two}} disorders. Methods: Twenty-five patients with CHF and 25 patients with COPD, and 36 healthy gender- and age-matched control subjects underwent measurement of fat-free mass (FFM) [by bioelectrical impedance analysis] as an index of muscle mass. Quadriceps and biceps functions were tested by isokinetic methods, and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> was assessed by the Physical Activity Scale for Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. Peak oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 peak) was measured by incremental cycle ergometry. Results: PASE results were similar in patients with CHF and in patients with COPD, each group scoring lower than control subjects. FFM was also lower in patients than control subjects and correlated closely with quadriceps and biceps strength in all three subgroups, R values ranging from 0. 63 to 0. 78, with identical slopes.

The aim of this study is to gain insight into the objective <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> pattern of patients with CFS in comparison with healthy controls. The secondary objective is studying the awareness in performing physical activities. Methods: The objective <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> pattern was measured with a tri-axial accelerometer in 35 patients with CFS and in 35 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The objective <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and distribution of physical activities at low, medium and high intensity levels during the day were measured. Moreover, variability in performing physical activities within and between subjects was computed. Subjective ratings of self-reported <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed at a visual analog scale.

40|$|The Aging {{phenomenon}} entails {{increased costs}} {{to health care}} systems worldwide. Prevention and self-management of age-related conditions receive high priority in public health research. Multidimensionality of impairments should be considered when designing interventions targeting the older population. Detection of slow or fast changes in daily functioning can enable interventions that counteract the decline, e. g. through behavior change support. Technology facilitates unobtrusive monitoring of daily living, allowing continuous and real-time assessment of the health status. Sensing outdoors remains a challenge especially for non physiological parameters.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of two types of {{microprocessor-controlled}} prosthetic knee joints (MPKs) on perceived performance and everyday life activity level. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over trial. SUBJECTS: Thirty persons with a unilateral above-knee amputation or knee disarticulation classified as Medicare Functional Classification Level- 2. METHODS: Participants were measured in 3 conditions, i. e. using a mechanically controlled prosthesis, an MPK featuring a microprocessor-controlled stance and swing phase (MPKA), and an MPK featuring a microprocessor-controlled stance phase (MPKB). Subjects' perceived performance regarding prosthesis use was measured with the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. Subjects' activity level was quantified using accelerometry. As high within-group variability regarding subjects' functional performance was expected to impede detection of possible effects of an MPK, data were analysed for the total group and for 3 subgroups of participants. RESULTS: Participants' perception regarding ambulation, residual limb health, utility, and satisfaction with walking were significantly higher in the MPKA condition compared with the mechanical knee joint condition. Participants' activity level was similar in all knee joint conditions.

Design.   A descriptive cross-sectional design. Methods.   A convenience sample of 112 people completed the fatigue severity scale and Human Activity Profile. Participants differed in their renal history and were either predialysis or receiving renal replacement therapy. Results.   Women or older participants were significantly more fatigued and less active than men or younger participants. A significant difference between mean fatigue and activity scores was found for type of renal replacement therapy, with participants receiving peritoneal dialysis being the most fatigued and the least active. Additionally, lower levels of albumin were significantly correlated with greater levels of fatigue and the ability to engage in fewer activities. Conclusion.   People with chronic kidney disease regardless of whether they are predialysis or receiving either peritoneal or haemodialysis experience high levels of fatigue and are able to engage in fewer <b>daily</b> <b>activities.</b> The fatigue severity scale and the Human Activity Profile are useful indicators of fatigue and physical activities which can be used in routine assessment practices.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that favourable weather conditions determine the <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of lizards, {{because of their}} temperature-dependent behavioural performance. Inactivity, however, might have a selective advantage over activity, as it could increase survival by reducing exposure to predators. Consequently, {{the effects of weather}} conditions on the activity patterns of lizards should be strongly influenced by the presence of predators. Using remote camera traps, we test the hypothesis that predator presence and weather conditions interact to modulate <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> in two sedentary cordylid lizards, Karusasaurus polyzonus and Ouroborus cataphractus. While both species are closely related and have a fully overlapping distribution, the former is a fast-moving lightly armoured lizard, whereas the latter is a slow-moving heavily armoured lizard. The significant interspecific difference in antipredator morphology and consequently differential vulnerability to aerial and terrestrial predators, allowed us to unravel the effects of predation risk and weather conditions on <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Our results demonstrate that K. polyzonus is predominantly active during summer, when ambient temperatures are favourable enough to permit activity. In contrast, a peak in activity during spring was observed in O. cataphractus, with individuals being inactive during most of summer. While favourable weather conditions had a strong effect on the <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of K. polyzonus, no such relationship was present in O. cataphractus. Contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of terrestrial predators does not seem to affect <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> or alter the influence of weather conditions on <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> We conclude that inactivity in O. cataphractus appears to be related to seasonal differences in vulnerability to predators, rather than the presence of predators, and highlight the importance of additional selective pressures, such as food abundance, in determining the species' <b>activity</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} {{prompted}} by the curiosity of understanding, how tracking devices affect it’s users. With the increasing interest of wearable technologies like smartphones, smartwatches and tracking bracelets rises the {{need to understand the}} consequences of integrating these technologies in our daily life. Self-tracking devices gives an insight into the users <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and therefore tells a lot about it’s users daily life. Self-tracking is still in it’s early stages and could possibly be integrated into country's health systems, as a form of control, to see if the patient is following the doctor's advice. Self-tracking is a technology with advantages for the user, but it also represents a dangerous path, that can threaten the right to determine how people should live their lives. To examine what consequences self-tracking has for the user, we have conducted an in depth test of the tracking bracelet UP 24 from Jawbone. UP 24 is a bracelet that you pair with an application on your smartphone. Through functions like, a vibration if your are inactive, a team function that lets you monitor other friends <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> and a pedometer with a daily set goal, that will help you be healthier. We have tested the bracelets personally and then on four schoolteachers, who work together. The results are drawn from journals, wrote during the experiment, and a group interview with the teachers about their experiences. The project investigates what happens when you pair human and technology. To analyze this, have we included Bruno Latour's actor network theory, and Deborah Lupton's thoughts about the digital cyborg. We also include Landon Winner to describe how specific health discourses is represented in UP 24. Finally Albert Bandura's theory of cognitive psychology is helping us understand why the users respond differently to UP 24. We also include the perspectives of Anders Høeg Nissen, who has written a book on self-tracking. Based on our analysis have we reached the conclusion, that the bracelets affect the user of UP 24. The user is constantly confronted by the dominant health discourse of taking responsibility for its own health, and is stressed if the daily goals are not obtained. The team function is particularly stressing for the person in the team with the least steps taken. To meet the goals, which could be 10. 000 daily steps or be the number one on the team, the user alters it’s daily life to fulfill these. These alterations include walking to local grocery store or bicycling instead of taking the car. The users of tracking bracelets are more active, but it also comes at a cost for some of them. The need to follow the ever-changing goals can be very stressful and this may influent some users...|$|E

This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) on urban children's exercise correlates (i. e., self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, social support) and physical activity participation. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of DDR on urban school children's self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, perceived social support, and <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> A total of 101 participants responded to questionnaires assessing their self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, social support, and 1 -week physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> in August 2008 (pretest). Then fourth graders were assigned to the intervention group (3 30 -minute DDR sessions/week), while the fifth graders were placed in the comparison group. The outcome variables were measured again in May 2009 (posttest). The MANOVA with difference scores yielded a significant main effect for intervention. Follow-up tests indicated that the intervention children reported significantly greater increased self-efficacy (p <  0. 05), social support (p <  0. 05), and <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> (p <  0. 05) than the comparison children over time. The results suggested that the implementation of DDR could have a significantly positive effect on children's self-efficacy, social support, and <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> across time.

Content analysis identified 13 main subjects discussed in the communities, including (in de-scending order) “Fun on line, ” “Retirement, ” “Family,” “Health, ” “Work and Study, ” “Recreation ” “Finance,” “Religion and Spirituality, ” “Technology, ” “Aging,” “Civic and Social, ” “Shopping, ” and “Travels. ” The overall tone was somewhat more positive than nega-tive. Implications: The {{findings suggest that the}} utilities of Information and Communications Technolo-gies for older adults that were identified in previous research are valid for seniors ’ online communities as well. However, the findings suggest several other pos-sible benefits, which may be available only to online communities. The communities may provide social sup-port, contribute to self-preservation, and serve as an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Because they offer both leisure activity and an expanded social network, it is suggested that active participation in the communities may contribute to the well-being of older adults. Directions for future research and applied im-plications are further discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{increased}} rate of pseudarthrosis {{has been documented}} following posterolateral lumbar spine grafting in patients who smoke. This same relationship has been assumed for anterior cervical interbody grafting, but to our knowledge {{it has never been}} proven. This study compared the long-term radiographic and clinical results of smokers and nonsmokers who had undergone arthrodesis with autogenous bone graft following multi-level anterior cervical decompression for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy, or both. Methods: One hundred and ninety patients were followed clinically and radiographically {{for at least two years}} (range, two to fifteen years). Fifty-nine of the patients had corpectomy with strut-grafting, and 131 patients had multiple discectomies and interbody grafting. Fifty-five of the 190 patients had a history of active cigarette-smoking; fifteen of the fifty-five had corpectomy with strut-grafting, and forty had multilevel discectomies and interbody grafting. Internal fixation was not used in any patient. The reconstruction techniques and postoperative bracing regimen were similar between smokers and nonsmokers. Osseous union was judged on dynamic lateral radio-graphs made at least two years following surgery, and clinical outcomes were judged on the basis of pain level, medication usage, and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> Results: Of the forty smokers who had undergone multilevel interbody grafting, twenty had a solid fusion at all lev-els, whereas sixty-nine of the ninety-one nonsmokers had solid fusion at all levels (p < 0. 02; chi-square test).

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: There is only sparse data on {{clinical}} results and complications of the third-generation Gamma nailing system (Gamma 3, Stryker). Therefore, we started a large multi-centre case series in 2008. The {{aim of this}} paper is to present the study design and early results of a single arm of a prospective, consecutive, monitored, post-market follow-up evaluation of Gamma 3 nails. Methods: From September 2009 to January 2012, 154 consecutive patients with an average age of 80 ± 1. 43 years (50 - 99 years) and a trochanteric femoral fracture were included in the local arm of the trial. All patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were treated with a Gamma 3 nail. Preoperative variables included age, gender, fracture classification, walking ability (Merle d’Aubigné score), <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> (retrospective Zuckerman score), ASA rating of operative risk, waiting time for operation, use of walker or crutches and body mass index (BMI). Skin-to-skin time, fluoroscopy time, blood loss, intraoperative complications and device information were recorded for each patient. Follow-up postoperative assessment was undertaken at 4, 12 and 24 months. Hip range of motion, pain around the hip and the tight, walking ability (Merle d’Aubigné score, Sahlgrenska mobility score) and management of daily life (Zuckerman score) were used to evaluate the outcome. Results: The descriptive data of age, gender, BMI, ASA classification, fracture type and skin-to-skin time is similar to other studies. Median fluoroscopy time was 62 seconds (range: 4 - 225 seconds) and significantly shorter in close...|$|E
40|$|Some people remain lean despite {{pressure}} to gain weight. Lean {{people tend to}} have high <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> but {{the source of this}} increased activity is unknown. We found that leanness cannot be accounted for by increased weightcorrected food intake in two different types of lean rats. As previously reported in lean people, we found that lean rats had higher <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> levels; lean rats also expended more energy. These lean rats were developed through artificial selection for high aerobic endurance capacity. To test whether our findings extended to a human population, we measured endurance capacity using a VO 2 max treadmill test and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> in a group of non-exercising individuals. Similar to lean rats selectively bred for endurance capacity, our study revealed that people with higher VO 2 max also spent more time active throughout the day. Hence, endurance capacity may be the trait that underlies both physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> and leanness. We identified one potential mechanism for the lean, active phenotype in rats, namely high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK. Therefore, the lean phenotype is characterized by high endurance capacity and high activity and may stem from altere...|$|R
40|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{associated}} with cardiorespiratory abnormalities and peripheral muscle discomfort {{are the major}} factors that limit exercise capacity in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and those with congestive heart failure (CHF). Both of these symptoms negatively impact on patients’ <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> In turn, poor <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> is commonly associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes partially reverse muscle weakness and dysfunction and increase functional capacity in both COPD and CHF. However, benefits gained from participation in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes are regressing soon after the completion of these programmes. Moreover, several barriers limit access and uptake of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes by eligible patients. A potential solution to the underutilisation of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is the implementation of tele-rehabilitation interventions at home using information and communications technologies. Thus, tele-rehabilitation may be useful to encourage and educate patients with COPD or CHF on how best to maintain and/or further enhance <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{evidence}} that urbanisation {{is associated with}} obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, this article compares <b>daily</b> physical <b>activity</b> between rural and urban dwellers. Specifically, it examines habitual <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> non-exercise <b>activity</b> thermogenesis (NEAT) and energy expenditure in agricultural and urban Jamaicans and urban North Americans. Ambulation was 60 per cent greater in rural Jamaicans than in the urban dwellers (4675 ± 2261 versus 2940 ± 1120 ambulation-attributed arbitrary units (AU) /day; P = 0. 001). Levels of ambulation in lean urban Jamaicans {{were similar to those}} in lean urban North Americans, whereas obese urban dwellers walked less than their lean urban counterparts (2198 ± 516 versus 2793 ± 774 AU/day; P = 0. 01). The data with respect to daily sitting mirrored the walking data; obese Americans sat for almost four hours more each day than rural Jamaicans (562 ± 78 versus 336 ± 68 minutes/day; P...|$|R
