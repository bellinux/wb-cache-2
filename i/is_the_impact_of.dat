5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne's {{air quality}} is {{generally}} good and has improved significantly since the 1980s. Like many urban environments, the city faces significant environmental issues, {{many of them}} relating to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl {{and the demand for}} infrastructure and services. One such issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> drought on water supply. Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors on Melbourne's water supplies. During the Millennium drought, the Bracks Government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, greywater systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water saving and reuse initiatives. However, as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant, and the so-called North-South Pipeline from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria's north to Melbourne. Neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during 2010, and therefore both have been criticised as 'white elephants'.|$|E

[...] Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. The primary causes for {{an increased risk of}} species endangerment are declining food availability, due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for the species's placement on the Endangered Species Act's list include disease, habitat destruction, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans.

500|$|The {{majority}} of Roa Bastos' work {{was written in}} exile owing to the oppressive political condition of his country, {{at a time when}} Paraguay was one of the least culturally, economically, and politically developed countries in Latin America. Thus, much of Roa Bastos' important writing is an attempt to [...] "capture the tragic essence, the 'inner weakness' as well as the inner strength of his country's people." [...] His work reveals an intense preoccupation not only with contemporary Paraguay but with its history, looking {{back to the beginning of}} the 19th century and the rule of Dr. Gaspar de Francia (whose life is the focus of Yo, el Supremo). While key historical figures and events interest Roa Bastos, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> these [...] "socio-historical roots" [...] on [...] "the nature of the masses" [...] that forms the central theme of his literary work.|$|E

2500|$|Subtitled [...] "Heroic and Tragic Tales", Sade {{combines}} {{romance and}} horror, employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes.

It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> sadism instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works.

[...] Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> taxation that may apply if in-game items are seen as having real value. [...] If (for example) a magic sword is considered to have real-world value, a player who kills a powerful monster to earn such a sword could find himself being charged tax on the value of the sword, as would be normal for a [...] "prize winning". [...] This would make it impossible for any player of the game not to participate in real-money trading.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Gansu Survey of Children and Families (GSCF) is a longitudinal study of poverty, education, health, and economic mobility among children and youth in Gansu, rural northwest China. The initial wave of the study (GSCF- 1) interviewed 2000 children at ages 9 to 12 in the year 2000; re-interviews were conducted in 2004, 2007, and 2009. (At present the UK Data Archive only holds data from Wave 1.) The project addresses the following questions: What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> childhood nutrition and health on subsequent education? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> childhood nutrition and health on psychological well-being? What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> correlation between psychological well-being and education outcomes, and how does the evolution of behavioral and psychological problems over time vary by family, school and community characteristics? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> childhood nutrition and health on the decision {{to stay in school}} or enter the workforce? How do education outcomes, including specific cognitive skills, affect the labour force productivity of young adults? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> childhood nutrition and health on the labour productivity of young adults?
