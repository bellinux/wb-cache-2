40|$|Abstract: Development {{trend of}} modern HSDI diesel engine is now {{focusing}} on low fuel consumption and emission because of {{strong interest in}} global environmental protection. Two big branches of criteria for modern diesel engine development are down sizing and <b>down</b> <b>speeding.</b> Down sizing keeps engine operation condition to the direction of higher load and thus pursuing for better thermal efficiency. But this may cause degraded vehicle dynamic performance because of reduced back up torque. <b>Down</b> <b>speeding</b> keeps engine operation condition to the direction of slightly higher load and lower engine speed. Therefore reduction of back up torque can be limited within flat torque area. This study analyzed fuel economy effect of <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> on a vehicle powered by HSDI diesel engine in aspect of engine friction work, intake and exhaust pumping work, exhaust hat loss and thermal loss of fuel leakage of fuel injection system. Contribution factor of each engine and vehicle related parameters under basic and <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> condition were compared and work balance of <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> during NEDC was analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{the high}} overall efficiency, truck {{manufacturers}} stick to diesel engines {{particularly in the case}} of long haul heavy duty trucks. In the ever increasing demand to increase the efficiency and to decrease the emission levels of the internal combustion engines an attempt is made in this thesis work to increase the fuel efficiency. There are many ways to increase the fuel efficiency like varying compression ratio, downsizing, <b>down</b> <b>speeding,</b> advanced combustion concepts (PCCI, HCCI) etc. but each of the mentioned method comes with challenges. In this thesis work an effort is made to study downspeeding by means of extensive simulation using commercial software GT-Power. By <b>down</b> <b>speeding,</b> the engine is made to run at low speeds and with high torques. For the same power the engine is operated at higher specific load (BMEP) which results in higher efficiency and reduced fuel consumption (BSFC). The reasons for increased fuel efficiency are reduced engine friction due to low piston speeds, reduced relative heat transfer and increased thermodynamic efficiency. Since this is a conceptual study and experiments may require a new engine design altogether, scope of the study is limited to simulation results and no validation is done...|$|E

40|$|Introducing {{a monitor}} {{on a system}} {{typically}} changes the system’s behaviour by slowing the system down and increasing memory consumption. This may possibly result in creating new bugs, or possibly even ‘fixing’ bugs, only to reappear as the monitor is removed. Properties written in a real-time logic, such as duration calculus, can be particularly sensitive to such changes induced through monitoring. The same problem occurs in other scenarios such as when a system is ported to a faster machine. In this paper, we identify a class of real-time properties, in duration calculus, which are monotonic under the slowing <b>down</b> (<b>speeding</b> up) of the underlying system. We apply this approach to the real-time runtime monitoring tool Larva, where we use duration calculus as a monitoring property specification language, so we automatically identify properties which can {{be shown to be}} monotonic with respect to system re-timing. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} of parsing piano music interpretation is presented. We focus mainly on quantifying expressive timing activities. A {{small number of}} different expressive timing behaviors (constant, slowing <b>down,</b> <b>speeding</b> up, accent) are defined in order to explain the tempo discretely. Given a MIDI performance of a piano music, we simultaneously estimate both discrete variables that corresponds to the behaviors and continuous variables that describe tempo. A graphical model is introduced to represent {{the evolution of the}} discrete behaviors and tempo progression. We demonstrate a computational method that acquires the approximate most likely configuration of the discrete behaviors and the hidden continuous variable tempo. This configuration represent a “smoothed ” version of the performance which greatly reduces parametrization while retaining most of its musicality. Experiments are presented on several MIDI piano music performed on a digital piano. An user study is performed to evaluate our method. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} study {{based on}} the Stokes equations is conducted to investigate the effects of gravitational forces on miscible displacements in vertical Hele-Shaw cells. Nonlinear simulations provide the quasi-steady displacement fronts in the gap of the cell, whose stability to spanwise perturbations is subsequently examined {{by means of a}} linear stability analysis. The two-dimensional simulations indicate a marked thickening (thinning) and slowing <b>down</b> (<b>speeding</b> up) of the displacement front for flows stabilized (destabilized) by gravity. For the range investigated, the tip velocity is found to vary linearly with the gravity parameter. Strongly stable density stratifications lead to the emergence of flow patterns with spreading fronts, and to the emergence of a secondary needle-shaped finger, similar to earlier observations for capillary tube flows. In order to investigate the transition between viscously driven and purely gravitational instabilities, a comparison is presented between displacement flows and gravity-driven flows without net displacements. The linear stability analysis shows that both the growth rate and the dominant wavenumber depend only weakly on the Péclet number. The growth rate varies strongly with the gravity parameter, so that even a moderately stable density stratifica-tion can stabilize the displacement. Both the growth rate and the dominant wavelength increase with the viscosity ratio. For unstable density stratifications, the dominant wavelength is nearly independent of the gravity parameter, while it increases strongly for stable density stratifications. Finally, the kinematic wave theory of Lajeunesse et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 398, 1999, p. 299) is seen to capture the stability limit quite accurately, while the Darcy analysis misses important aspects of the instability. 1...|$|E

40|$|To The Editor: It is {{estimated}} that 1. 26 million people worldwide died in 2000 from road traffic accidents, 90 % of them in low and middle-income countries. In 2000, the road traffic injury mortality rate for the world was 20. 8 per 100, 000 populations (30. 8 in males, 11. 0 in females) [1]. The Arab population constitutes 3. 6 % of the world’s population and it owns 1 % of the world’s vehicles. Its human losses {{as a result of}} road traffic accidents (RTA) account for 4. 8 % of that of the world’s losses [2]. It {{is estimated}} that the annual cost of road crashes is about 1 % of the Gross National Product (GNP) in developing countries, 1. 5 in transitional countries and 2 % in highly motorised countries [3]. In Libya the situation is worse. It is a sad fact that road traffic accidents are the number one killer in Libya. As a matter of fact I consider it to be an ‘epidemic’ in all sectors of the Libyan society. There is not a day that goes by in Libya without us hearing about families, young men, women and children getting killed in horrific car accidents. It is alarming that young children are knocked down on a daily basis by speeding young drivers, whose understanding of driving skills may have been acquired from "playstation games"! (You can watch some of the shameful video clips sent by some of these drivers on this link [URL] feel it is our responsibility as physicians observing the situation to raise awareness about the scale of the problem, possible causes, and how to tackle it. POSSIBLE CAUSES:• A driving licence in Libya is not issued on the basis of how much you know. Therefore the majority of drivers know little or nothing about the law. • Wearing seat belts is not compulsory in most parts of Libya. In some places, especially in the Eastern part of Libya, you could be penalised for wearing one. I was stopped many years ago by the traffic police in the Eastern part of Libya because I was wearing sunglasses and a seatbelt. I had to apologize profusely to the young traffic policeman and explain that I was wearing sunglasses because I was driving facing the sun! The reason for wearing the seatbelt was a habit from living abroad for many years and I was not a "show off" as he put it! This incidence made me wonder how much the traffic police knew about the law?• In Libya the way we behave in the street, the way we drive and our attitude towards pedestrians is not taught in schools at an early age. As a matter of fact, many drivers think it is "cool" to scare pedestrians. • Most of the accidents in Libya occur at school times but unfortunately no measures are taken by the traffic police to help young children to cross roads safely. • Most of the road traffic accidents happen at the same areas but these are never identified as "black spots" to warn drivers of the possible dangers. • Although Zebra Crossings exist in some parts of Libya, they actually do not serve the purpose. We just need to count how many pedestrians (especially foreign visitors) have been knocked down at Zebra Crossings. • There is a need for new road signs, clear road markings (lanes), and new traffic lights to replace old and often non-functioning ones. • One study demonstrated that speeding was responsible for about 70 % of accidents [4]. There are no speed cameras or road humps to slow <b>down</b> <b>speeding</b> cars, therefore residents who have lost children to road traffic accidents resort to building their own version of street humps made from old pipes, thick ropes or cement. • Most of the main roads are full of holes and in desperate need of maintenance. • Car seats for children are not compulsory. • When accidents happen in Libya, what number do we dial? Do emergency services exist?• It is a known fact that most of the deaths and permanent disabilities in road traffic accidents are caused by people trying to help {{due to the lack of}} Advanced Trauma and Life Support (ATLS) trained personnel [5, 6]. • It is well documented that Advanced Trauma and Life Support (ATLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS) courses improve survival [5]. Unfortunately in Libya they are not compulsory for nurses or doctors. Some doctors and nurses working in the Emergency department are even unaware that these courses exist. Therefore, it is no surprise that the majority of car accident causalities dies or sustain permanent disabilities despite reaching the hospital in redeemable condition. WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?A. Ministry of Health: 1. We must put pressure on the ministry of health and offer our services in running ATLS, ALS and Trauma courses to all medical personnel and paramedics. These courses should become a prerequisite for qualifying to work in the Medical field especially for those who directly deal with trauma patients. 2. All hospitals dealing with trauma must have well trained and well equipped trauma and cardiac arrest teams whose ATLS/ ALS knowledge is revalidated periodically. 3. Emphasise the importance of introducing the Bleep/Page System. 4. Train paramedics and improve the Emergency Service [5, 6]. 5. Emergency phone numbers should exist and should be made free of charge to dial. B. Ministry of Education: 1. Educate children at an early age about behaviour in the street and dangers on the road. 2. The schools should share the responsibilities with the traffic police in ensuring the safety of pupils. 3. Supply posters and educate the public. 4. The United Nations invited member states and the international community to recognize the third Sunday in November of every year as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims as the appropriate acknowledgement for victims of road traffic crashes and their families. I think a union should be formed in Libya, of people who have lost relatives to car accidents to campaign and educate drivers as per recommendation of the UN [7]. C. Ministry of Transport: 1. Re-validate the traffic police on their behaviour and knowledge of the law. 2. Revise and re-enforce the traffic law with strict monitoring and speed cameras. 3. Re-enforce Zebra Crossings with lights and give penalties to drivers who do not adhere. 4. It is a well known fact that financial penalties are more effective than other forms of penalties on re-enforcing the law. 5. Improve the conditions of the roads i. e. regular maintenance, road markings, road humps, traffic lights, road mirrors and road signs. 6. Re-validate the driving licences with written and practical exams. 7. Roadside assistance through a mobile workshop / emergency phones by the roadside. 8. Only road-worthy vehicles should be allowed on the road through re-enforcement of a safety certification system for vehicles. 9. Regulate the issue and distribution of driving licences and vehicle safety certification through the use of IT (Information Technology) systems. 10. It is about time that a national policy for injury prevention and control in Libya should be formed thorough the coordination between different ministries, departments and the various agencies concerned. These are the suggestions and visions of one person but I am sure that many of you will share my views...|$|E
