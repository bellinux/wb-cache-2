5|$|Sheppard's efforts {{contributed to}} the {{contemporary}} debate on European colonialism and imperialism in the region, particularly amongst the African American community. However, historians <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> he has traditionally received little recognition for his contributions.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the relationship between the}} protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
2500|$|Coughlin <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> he [...] "sensed {{how deeply}} lawmakers value prayer and the {{presence}} of the chaplain in the halls of Congress" [...] after the September 11 attacks. He <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> his understanding of this need brought [...] "a further gravity to his duties." ...|$|R

5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige {{was tall and}} Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} if Majungasaurus {{actively}} hunted {{their own kind}} or only scavenged their carcasses. However, some researchers <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> modern Komodo monitors sometimes kill each other when competing for access to carcasses. The lizards will then proceed to cannibalize the remains of their rivals, which may suggest similar behavior in Majungasaurus and other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Métis {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Riel is a {{more important}} figure to non-Métis than to Métis; {{he is the only}} Métis figure most non-Métis are aware of. Political scientists such as Thomas Flanagan have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and millenarian cults.|$|E

5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} of Drake have drawn comparisons to other video game and film characters, such as Lara Croft and Indiana Jones. Many reviewers have called Drake a likable and believable character, and <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> he {{is a rare}} example of a physically attractive character who is not hypermasculine.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories have}} {{appeared}} {{in a variety of}} adaptations including a musical and animated films. Evolutionary biologists <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> what Kipling did in fiction, they have done in reality, providing explanations for the evolutionary development of animal features.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators {{and as a}} chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E

5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Love's later {{musical work}} is more lyrically introspective. Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically {{centered}} on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, {{with the majority}} of its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be}} more {{descriptive and}} less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{instead of}} hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, {{and his successor}} Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 {{the castle}} {{was given to}} the State by Sir Michael Duff. It is now {{maintained}} by Cadw and is protected as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument. In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes, the history of Dolbadarn Castle and similar Welsh castles has become increasing prominent. In response, Cadw <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E

5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. At {{one point in the}} book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{personal identity}} {{is a strong}} theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
