5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent <b>dielectric</b> <b>properties.</b> Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

40|$|Dispersion, attenuation, and {{crosstalk}} {{are several}} major challenges that both a high-speed digital and a microwave serial link must overcome {{to achieve their}} desirable performance. These phenomena {{are directly related to}} the frequency dependency of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>property</b> of the material used in package and interconnect. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>property</b> of a material is commonly measured by its manufacturer in a particular direction at a few discrete frequencies using resonator and waveguide methodology. Since the <b>dielectric</b> <b>property</b> may vary during manufacturing processing, the measurements taken by the manufacturer might be not adequate. Moreover, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>property</b> of a material in a bandwidth that covers at least the second harmonics of the fundamental operational frequency is required to accurately predict the link performance. One of the efforts in this research is to investigate the methodology of realizing broadband characteristics of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>property</b> of a material in its "as packaged" configuration using various transmission line topologies, such as microstrip line and Co-Planar Waveguide (CPW). Transitions from CPW to other transmission line topologies are mandatory if CPW probes are used to achieve broadband and repeatable measurements. Since microstrip line is one of the transmission line topologies involved in this research, a research effort is dedicated to develop a broadband CPW-to-microstrip line transition. An effort is also expended to creating casual material models {{that can be used in}} electromagnetic simulators to appropriately model the link based on the polarization mechanism of the materials. In addition to focusing on the measurement method in frequency domain, Short Pulse Propagation (SPP), a time domain method, is investigated as well.

The dielectric permittivity above the dielectric maximum temperature (Tm) is mostly dominated by the ionic polarization, while that below Tm is governed by the dipole polarization. Dielectric permittivity given by the dipole polarization increased and the relaxation frequency decreased with decreasing temperature. These phenomena are related to a increase of the size of polar nanoregions (PNRs).

Currently, researchers have shown interest in hybrid composites, which are capable of improving performance and increase reliability of devices.

2500|$|The {{availability}} of both amplitude and {{phase of the}} scattered field measured in nano-FTIR allows for the recovery of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, i.e. finding the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the sample. While such recovery for arbitrarily-shaped samples or samples exhibiting collective excitations, such as phonons, requires a resource-demanding numerical optimization, for soft matter samples (polymers, biological matter and other organic materials) {{the recovery of the}} dielectric function could often be performed in real time using fast semi-analytical approaches. One of such approaches is based on the Taylor expansion of the scattered field with respect to a small parameter that isolates the <b>dielectric</b> <b>properties</b> of the sample and allows for a polynomial representation of measured near-field contrast.

2500|$|Limits of {{the method}} {{are related to the}} {{parameter}} sets used, and to the underlying molecular mechanics force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the potential energy, rather than the free energy of the protein , meaning that all entropic contributions to thermodynamic stability of protein structure are neglected, including the conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and hydrophobic effects (the main driving forces of protein folding). Another important factor are intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are not explicitly included in modern force fields, but described as Coulomb interactions of atomic point charges. This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially quantum mechanical and chemical nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the dielectric constant of vacuum, although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the macroscopic dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, van der Waals interactions in MD are usually described by Lennard-Jones potentials based on the Fritz London theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on <b>dielectric</b> <b>properties</b> of the environment. The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as Hamaker constant) shows that [...] "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum". The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.|$|E
