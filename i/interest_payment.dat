5|$|No great {{compromise}} reached Taylor's desk {{during his}} presidency; instead, his last days were {{overshadowed by the}} Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford {{had served as a}} lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid {{at the time of the}} American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.|$|E

25|$|On June 1, 2008, Philadelphia Media Holdings missed its <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> on US$85 {{million in}} junior loans. Philadelphia Media Holdings missed the payment because it didn't {{maintain}} debt-to-cash flow ratio its senior lenders required so they blocked the payment. The company began negotiations with its lenders to restructure its debt and in October 2008 Philadelphia Media Holdings deferred paying its <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> despite having {{the money to}} do so. Charged $13.4 million in penalty interest and fees, Philadelphia Media Holdings continued negotiations with lenders until February 20, 2009, when the talks collapsed. Late the next day Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the papers, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Philadelphia Media Holdings hoped to restructure its US$390 million in debt it incurred when buying the newspapers.|$|E
50|$|Under the GAAP, the {{interest}} {{component of the}} periodic cash proceeds is computed separately.

25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the {{key benefit}} of raising money by selling {{convertible}} bonds is a reduced cash <b>interest</b> <b>payment.</b> The advantage for companies of issuing convertible bonds is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes. However, {{in exchange for}} the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares.|$|E

QSCBs were created by Section 1521 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Internal Revenue Code Section 54F also addresses QSCBs.|$|E

25|$|Backed by {{his mother}} Eleanor of Aquitaine, who {{successfully}} defended his interests against his rivaling brother John Lackland and his ally King Philip of France, King Richard procured his release {{in exchange for the}} huge ransom, a further <b>interest</b> <b>payment,</b> and his oath of allegiance to Henry. In turn the emperor under threat of military violence demanded the restitution of the French lands, which John had seized upon approval by Philip during Richard's absence. Henry not only gained another vassal and ally, he could also assume the role of a mediator between England and France. He and Richard ceremoniously reconciled at the Hoftag in Speyer during Holy Week 1194: the English King publicly regretted any hostilities, genuflected, and cast himself on the emperor's mercy. He was released and returned to England.|$|E
25|$|Before the merger, the cash-strapped Granite Broadcasting Corporation {{had reached}} an {{agreement}} to sell its WB affiliates in San Francisco and Detroit to AM Media, a unit of private equity firm Acon Investments. With The CW choosing to affiliate with CBS-owned UPN stations in those markets, the Granite-AM Media deal eventually collapsed, and Granite responded by deciding to instead sell the stations to DS Audible, LLC for a lesser price. Granite later {{announced that it would}} sue CBS and Time Warner over the failed deal. On July 18, 2006, the deal to sell to DS Audible also fell apart, and on December 11, 2006, Granite filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization after missing an <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> on its $400 million+ debt. Granite emerged from bankruptcy in June 2007 under control of Silver Point Capital, which also took over another bankrupt broadcasting company, Communications Corporation of America (a key Fox affiliate group in smaller markets within the Southern U.S.), later that year. Granite retains KOFY in San Francisco to this day, while it would eventually sell WMYD in Detroit to the E. W. Scripps Company (creating a duopoly with that market's ABC affiliate, WXYZ-TV (channel 7)) in 2014.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit the choice allowed by IFRS {{regarding}} {{the presentation of}} <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on the cash flow statement to answer two related questions: First, whether the classification choice is explained by firm reporting incentives and second, whether it is value relevant. Using a UK sample, we find that firms reporting losses, with {{a greater proportion of}} their debt stemming from public sources, with CFO-based covenants and greater increases in leverage in the year of adoption are less likely to report <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in cash flows from operating activities (CFOA). Results also suggest that the incentive to meet or beat analyst CFO forecasts decreases, but strong corporate governance increases the probability of including <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA. Based {{on the assumption that the}} decision not to classify <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA captures lower disclosure quality or poor future expected performance, we posit that these firms should also exhibit lower valuations. Results obtained after correcting for self-selection bias confirm this assertion. We conclude that managers’ decision not to classify <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> in CFOA is consistent with the opportunistic use of the choice allowed by IFRS...|$|R

500|$|The debt {{taken on}} by the Glazers to finance the {{takeover}} was split between the club and the family; between £265million and £275million was secured against Manchester United's assets, putting the club into debt {{for the first time}} since James Gibson saved them in 1931. This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders want to invest in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market." [...] The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded, [...] "'The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge... The <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> is one thing but what about the actual £660million? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices, which, as we always suspected, means the fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club." [...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E
2500|$|The coupon is the {{interest}} rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout {{the life of the}} bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as LIBOR, or it can be even more exotic. The name [...] "coupon" [...] arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each <b>interest</b> <b>payment.</b> On the due dates the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the <b>interest</b> <b>payment.</b> Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.|$|E
