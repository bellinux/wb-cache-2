At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks.

5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

25|$|The horse hoof {{is not at}} all a rigid structure. It is elastic and flexible. Just {{squeezing}} the heels by hand will demonstrate that. When loaded, the hoof physiologically changes its shape. In part, this is a result of solar concavity, which has a variable depth, in the region of 1–1.5cm. In part, it {{is a result of the}} arched shape of the lateral lower profile of the walls and sole, so that when an unloaded hoof touches a <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> surface, there is only contact at toe and heels (active contact). A loaded hoof has a much greater area of ground contact (passive contact), covering the lower wall edge, most of the sole, bars and frog. Active contact areas can be seen as slightly protruding spots in the walls and in the callused sole.|$|E

25|$|Logic {{sentences}} {{that can be}} expressed in classical propositional calculus have an equivalent expression in Boolean algebra. Thus, Boolean logic is sometimes used to denote propositional calculus performed in this way. Boolean algebra {{is not sufficient to}} capture logic formulas using quantifiers, like those from first order logic. Although the development of mathematical logic did not follow Boole's program, the connection between his algebra and logic was later put on <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> in the setting of algebraic logic, which also studies the algebraic systems of many other logics. The problem of determining whether the variables of a given Boolean (propositional) formula can be assigned {{in such a way as}} to make the formula evaluate to true is called the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and is of importance to theoretical computer science, being the first problem shown to be NP-complete. The closely related model of computation known as a Boolean circuit relates time complexity (of an algorithm) to circuit complexity.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, German {{newspaper}} Bild {{reported that}} German Army experts had {{concerns that the}} helicopter was not yet ready for the transportation of combat troops. They stated that the seats were only rated for 110kg (240lb), not considered enough for a fully equipped soldier. Heavy infantry weapons could not be adequately secured and the cabin floor was prone to damage, citing an anecdote of damage caused by footwear. The helicopter could only land on <b>firm</b> <b>ground,</b> with obstacles not exceeding 16cm (6.3in). Troops carrying full equipment could not use the rear ramp due to weight-limitations placed on it. Adding a door machine gun was not possible due to space taken by troop ingress and egress; there was also no provision for fast roping or paratroop equipment. In response, the German Defense Ministry proclaimed that this article referred to a prototype, not to the production model; the specifications for which were not even finalised at the time. The prototype evaluation and its results were described as a normal procedure in an ongoing design process.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a mattock fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or <b>firm</b> <b>ground.</b> The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands. The mattock is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to slide down and be removed.|$|E

25|$|Soon the Russians found {{themselves}} huddled {{together in the}} bends of the Alle, {{an easy target for}} the guns of Ney and of the reserve. Ney's attack indeed came eventually to a standstill; Bennigsen's reserve cavalry charged with great effect and drove him back in disorder. As at Eylau, the approach of night seemed to preclude a decisive success, but in June and on <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> the old mobility of the French reasserted its value. The infantry division of Dupont advanced rapidly from Posthenen, the cavalry divisions drove back the Russian squadrons into the now congested masses of infantry on the river bank, and finally the artillery general Sénarmont advanced a mass of guns to case-shot range. The terrible effect of the close range artillery saw the Russian defense collapsing within minutes, as canister decimated the ranks. Ney's exhausted infantry succeeded in pursuing the broken regiments of Bennigsen's left into the streets of Friedland. Lannes and Mortier had meanwhile held the Russian centre and right on its ground, and their artillery had inflicted severe losses. When Friedland itself was seen to be on fire, the two marshals launched their infantry attack. Fresh French troops approached the battlefield. Dupont distinguished himself for the second time by fording the mill-stream and assailing the left flank of the Russian centre. This offered stubborn resistance, but the French steadily forced the line backwards, and the battle was soon over.|$|E

500|$|English Heritage, {{responsible}} for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate {{the site for}} Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss.

Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed {{that by the end}} of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been improved to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Ashby Canal carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway crossed the area on an embankment.

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tho was also {{becoming}} unpopular {{in the military}} establishment.

A more important reason for the incumbent generals' lack of preparedness for Khánh's coup was their misunderstanding of the US stance. After what had happened to Diệm, as well as other failed coup attempts, they regarded American backing as the decisive factor for the survival of any government and the success of any coup. As a result, repeated assurances from Lodge and Johnson's laudatory comments in private and public convinced them that they remained on <b>firm</b> <b>ground.</b> Johnson had told Lodge to assure Minh in a meeting on January 1, 1964, that he had [...] "the complete support of the United States as the leader of Vietnam [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Comics scholar Arnold T.

[...] Silver Age {{historian}} Craig Shutt disputes this, saying, [...] "Gwen Stacy's death shocked Spider-Man readers. Such a tragedy makes a strong symbolic ending. This theory gained adherents when Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' Marvels miniseries in 1994 ended with Gwen's death, but I'm not buying it. It's too late. Too many new directions — especially [...] Conan and monsters [...] — were on <b>firm</b> <b>ground</b> by this time." [...] He also dismisses {{the end of}} the 12-cent comic book, which went to 15 cents as the industry standard in early 1969, noting that the 1962 hike from 10 cents to 12 cents had no bearing in this regard. Shutt's line comes with Fantastic Four #102 (Sept. 1970), Jack Kirby's last regular-run issue before the artist left to join DC Comics; this combines with DC's Superman #229 (Aug. 1970), editor Mort Weisinger's last before retiring.|$|E
