5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Elizabeth,--"no. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> him. There is something.... But I don't know.

Since I have promised, however, and you are kind enough to desire it, I will come." ...|$|R
25|$|Hasheesh {{is indeed}} an accursed drug, {{and the soul}} at last pays a most bitter price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of {{it is not the}} proper means of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> things as they are more truly than ever in the {{ordinary}} state?.... In the jubilance of hashish, we have only arrived by an improper pathway at the secret of that infinity of beauty which shall be beheld in heaven and earth when the veil of the corporeal drops off, and we know as we are known.|$|E
500|$|His {{application}} of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as {{creative use of}} artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life: [...] "I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last".|$|E
500|$|During {{his stay}} in New York, Karthi {{worked as a}} {{part-time}} graphic designer. He then decided {{to pursue a career}} in film-making; he attended two courses in basic film-making at State University of New York. He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry".|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{that she}} is wrong in that sense. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that you have any right to blame her. Why <b>do</b> <b>not</b> you speak to your grandfather?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{where he is}} nor what are their {{intentions}} in regard to him. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what their intentions toward me are." ...|$|R

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> about [...] {{involvement}} in this company. As an adult, he made that decision. It was a lapse in judgement {{for him to get}} involved with this company. I wish he hadn't done it. I know the expectations for elected officials, their families, are very high—rightfully so—especially for me.... Patrick is a very good son. I love him. Maggie and I are very proud of him. I hope you respect I have nothing more to say on this.|$|E
500|$|Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald {{to stand}} for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a {{traditional}} Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. [...] "I told Mr. King that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald {{had no choice but}} {{to stand for}} office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson's lawyer, Julian Young, {{said the}} confessions had been vital {{information}} {{which could have}} freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. [...] "If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or to me {{as part of the}} appeal, it is surprising and very disappointing. This may raise serious questions about {{the way in which the}} police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Angela," [...] I said, [...] "I must {{talk to some}} one. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whom to trust. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> who is honest. You are {{the only}} person whom I dare speak to at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nomen nescio (/ˈnoː.men ˈnes.ki.oː/), IPA [...] {{abbreviated}} to N.N., {{is used to}} signify an anonymous or unnamed person. From Latin nomen, name, and nescio, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> (from nescire, <b>not</b> to <b>know),</b> it literally means, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the name.|$|R
500|$|A {{social worker}} and a police officer from Haringey council, Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones, respectively, were {{assigned}} to her case, and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999; however, the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies. Jones later said, [...] "it might not be logical but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything about scabies." [...] She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital {{for information about the}} disease, but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry. Jones was told by a doctor that Climbié's injuries were consistent with belt buckle marks, although she claimed in the inquiry {{there was no evidence of}} child abuse.|$|E
500|$|In an {{exclusive}} written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked {{of how he}} had struggled with prison, saying: [...] "They [...] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There {{is not a lot}} you can do about it... I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said so. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of my {{readers may}} have an {{interest}} in being informed whether or no any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know,</b> myself, until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look. I found the outer front courtyard, often mentioned in this story, metamorphosed into a butter shop; and then I almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost. Wandering, however, down a certain adjacent [...] "Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey", I came to [...] "Marshalsea Place": the houses in which I recognised, not only as the great block of the former prison, but as preserving the rooms that arose in my mind's eye when I became Little Dorrit's biographer...|$|E

50|$|I am wiser {{than this}} man, for {{neither of us}} appears to know {{anything}} great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas <b>I,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know.</b>|$|R
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} Tucker relates that, [...] "The play was over... and there {{appearing to be}} much delay in bringing on the afterpiece... I had fortunately quitted the house while it was on fire, tho' <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the fact... but the cry of fire prevented my reaching my lodgings, and hurried me back to witness a spectacle of human woe which I have never seen equalled. I was instrumental in saving several females from the flames." [...] In the process, he suffered a head injury when struck by a falling timber, and was left with a permanent scar above his eye. The tragedy took the lives of 72 people, including the sitting Governor of Virginia George William Smith. Victims also included many of the upper echelons in Richmond society.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how {{to explain why the}} elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|Douglas soon dragged Wilde {{into the}} Victorian {{underground}} of gay prostitution and Wilde {{was introduced to}} a series of young working-class male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde's idealised, pederastic relations with Ross, John Gray, and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in De Profundis he wrote to Douglas that [...] "It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay." ...|$|E

500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|As Friedman noted, if {{the price}} of silver had {{remained}} high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." [...] One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, [...] "at the beginning... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> Silver had been demonetized." ...|$|E
500|$|In Greek tradition, clepsydrae {{were used}} in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. There are several {{mentions}} of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that [...] "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on". Another mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: [...] "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief {{witness for the prosecution}} to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know.</b> He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base". The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.|$|E
