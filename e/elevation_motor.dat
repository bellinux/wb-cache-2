50|$|The 12/70 gun is a fully automatic, {{water-cooled}} vertical {{sliding wedge}} design mounted in an armored turret which is electrically traversed under computer control while the <b>elevation</b> <b>motor</b> is controlled manually (presumably a cost-cutting measure). It {{is fed from}} a magazine several meters below ground where the crew uses special air-cushion carts to feed cartridges onto a loading table. From the loading table the cartridge is fed through a hoist system and loaded into the gun using a pendulum loader. Spent cartridges are passed down a chute into a space {{at the bottom of}} the gun well, which is over 18 m deep on tapj 9101 and a few meters less on tapj 9102. The turret is manned by three men (gun commander, traverse operator and elevation operator) with the rest of the gun crew working in the magazine or the installation below.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the {{attitude control system}} of the MASCO experiment. The MASCO project is a balloon-borne gamma ray telescope in final phase of development at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE - Brazil). This experiment is a low energy gamma ray telescope that employs a Modified Uniformly Redundant Array (MURA) coded mask in an one-piece mask-antimask configuration. This is the first experiment to use such a mask pattern (MURA) and configuration for astrophysical purposes. The angular resolution is approximately 14 ' over 13 deg. field of view, which requires that the expected pointing accuracy of the attitude control system should be better than {{that in order to}} allow the accomplishment of the scientific goals. Several kinds of sensors (an electronic compass, an axis encoder, a two-axes solar sensor, two accelerometers, a gyroscope and two CCD cameras) are used by this system for redundancy and some of them achieve a precision better than 0. 1 deg. The main actuators are: a reaction wheel for azimuth control, an azimuth motor located in the gondola-balloon decoupling mechanism for desaturation of the reaction wheel and a telescope <b>elevation</b> <b>motor</b> with a harmonic drive reduction. The control system software architecture consists basically of two main files, one with the main calculation routines and the other with the interface routines. The main program starts with the initialization routines and enters a loop of sequential execution of tasks. For each operation mode there is a different sequence of routines. 2...|$|E

40|$|SLR 2000 is {{a concept}} for a totally {{automated}} subcentimeter SLR system presently being studied at GSFC. If funding permits, a prototype would be installed and tested at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory (GCAO) in FY 98 and {{a small number of}} automated stations would be fielded by the year 2000. Unlike present systems, the "SLR 2000 " system is being designed to: 1) operate autonomously without the need for onsite operators; 2) present no hazards (i. e., optical, electrical, and/or chemical) to personnel in the vicinity or to overflying aircraft; and 3) have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of at least three months. It is assumed that the systems are located at "friendly" sites where some level of security is provided and where certain low level service functions (e. g. commercial power, communications, heat pump service cleaning, etc.) are available or can be contracted for locally on an as-needed basis. The main system consists of two parts - an optical head and electronics rack. The optical head contains the laser transmitter and power supply, transmit/receive switch, optical telescope, tracking angle sensor (intensified CCD camera), detector and power supply, two angular encoders, azimuth and <b>elevation</b> <b>motors,</b> and a protective dome.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to test if reading during transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to modify stimulation-induced plasticity in the visual cortex. Phosphene thresholds (PT) in 12 healthy subjects were recorded before and after 10 minutes of anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS in combination with reading. Reading alone decreased PTs significantly, compared to the sham tDCS condition without reading. Interestingly, after both anodal and cathodal stimulation there was a tendency toward smaller PTs. Our results support the observation that tDCS-induced plasticity is highly dependent on the cognitive state of the subject during stimulation, not only in the case of motor cortex but also in the case of visual cortex stimulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the behaviours of three-phase induction motor driving centrifugal pump under various solar irradiation levels, where the motor speed and torque {{depend on the}} source voltage and frequency, while the water-flow rate depends on the motor speed, density, and static head according to affinity flow. Matlab/Simulink model is proposed for studying the behaviours of these machines with respect to water flow capacity, motor current, electro-magnetic torque, and motor efficiency. The proposed photovoltaic with {{maximum power point tracking}} model based on observation and perturbation (O&P) maximum power tracking model is applied. The output voltage is regulated throughout Buck-Boost converter with purpose maintaining the output voltage at predetermined values. Since Induction motors are widely used in pump systems, the electromagnetic torque, water-flow rate are studied for various source frequencies. Comparison analysis is conducted for both motors with respect to water flow-rate, heads <b>elevation,</b> and <b>motor</b> current.

50|$|The Overstrand was a {{development}} of the Boulton Paul Sidestrand, which had first flown in 1928 and like the Sidestrand was named for a village in Norfolk, home also of Boulton Paul's Norwich factory. The Sidestrand was similar to its First World War predecessors, in that it had open cockpits and hand-operated machine-guns. Unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at 140 mph making operating the guns in exposed positions difficult, particularly in the nose. The Overstrand was fitted with an enclosed and powered nose turret with a Lewis gun, the first RAF aircraft to have a power-operated turret. Rotation was by pneumatic <b>motors,</b> <b>elevation</b> and depression of the gun by hydraulic rams. The cockpit was also enclosed but the dorsal and ventral gun positions remained open, though shielded.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{delineate}} the effect of different combinations of frequency and amplitude of superimposed vibration on attainment of maximal strength in exercises with isometric or isotonic concentric muscular contraction. The study was conducted on male trained adult volunteers (n= 8, age= 33. 5 ± 3. 8). The athletes performed one arm pulling action without or with superimposed vibration that was transmitted from vibratory stimulation apparatus via cable and handle on the proximally located muscles of upper body. The exercises mode was isometric or isotonic concentric; in both cases the subjects developed maximal voluntary efforts. Vibration frequency varied between 17 – 38 Hz, and vibration amplitude between 2 – 8 mm. The ergogenic effect was evaluated as difference between force/power values attained in control and vibratory stimulated attempts. The findings display significant stimulatory effect of superimposed vibration in isotonic concentric exercise (increase varied between 8. 8 – 38. 3 %) and, in much lesser extent, in isometric drill (increase varied between 1. 7 – 5. 8 %). In isotonic exercise increase of vibration frequency and amplitude within the range of 17 – 38 Hz and 2 – 8 mm produced gradual <b>elevation</b> of <b>motor</b> output, whereas in isometric exercise only the proper combinations of frequency and amplitude provided appropriate intensity of mechanical signal, which determined maximal stimulatory effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{low-cost}} rigid foam-based concentrator {{technology development}} program {{was funded by}} the DOE SunShot Initiative to meet installed cost goals of $ 75 /m^ 2 vs. current costs of ∼ $ 200 – 250 /m^ 2. Phase 1 of the project focused on design trades and cost analyses leading to a cost-optimized self-powered autonomous tracking heliostat concept with a mirror surface area in the 100 m^ 2 range. In Phase 2 30 -year accelerated testing of the mirror modules based on ReflecTec film with 94 % specular reflectivity bonded on composite foam substrate were initiated and completed in Phase 3. The tests with 15 coupons showed optical performance degradation of less than 5 % in specular reflectance following 30 -year equivalent UV testing and other abuse testing such as acid rain, bird dropping, thermal cycling, etc. A small scale prototype (3 m× 2 m) heliostat design based on modular truss elements with removable mirror modules was developed in detail. In this phase components such as the dual-axis actuators were sized and selected based on wind load requirements and pointing accuracy demands were completed. Finite Element analyses for the mechanical structure with mirror modules were performed using three separate commercial codes — ANSYS, COMSOL and SolidWorks to validate the optical errors induced by wind loads on the structure up to 35 mph. Results indicated that the RMS deflections contributed to less than 0. 4 mrad pointing error. Dynamic response of the heliostat indicated that the first 5 eigenmodes were in the 17 – 20 Hz range. The individual structure elements such as the trusses and c-rails were fabricated locally and assembled with the mirror facets in the lab for initial fit check and testing. The nine mirror facet surface errors were characterized using photogrammetry and verified using Reverse Hartmann techniques and showed to be in the order of 1 mrad or less. A three-level controller (main, gateway and heliostat) was architected and built. Tracking of the sun is done using NREL’s Sun Tracking Algorithm implemented in the gateway controller. Target-pointing vectors are calculated for each heliostat and conveyed wirelessly to the individual heliostat controllers for actuating the azimuth and <b>elevation</b> <b>motors.</b> The power subsystem consisting of solar panels and a battery provide 24 V for the actuators and controller boards. The system was sized to provide adequate power for a period of 5 hrs of operation when power is not available. Initial calibration will be performed with on-site camera tracking the sun’s image on a target located approximately 52 m from the heliostat. Testing of the heliostat pointing under calm and windy conditions will be done to demonstrate overall performance that meet DOE targets of 4 mrad under 27 mph winds. Commercialization efforts are underway to transition the design to the commercial sector. The project is {{well on its way to}} approaching overall cost targets and current estimates are approximately S 90 – 110 /m^ 2 and lower costs can be achieved with alternates to the film we have identified...|$|R

Pharmacol., 2001, 53, 685 – 687. Rats of sham repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) group, kept in noisy room and transiently immobilized (5 min) for 12 consecutive days, showed similar inhibition of body weight gain, increase in exploratory locomotor activity, and <b>elevation</b> of <b>motor</b> response to apomorphine as rats undergoing magnetic stimulation of the brain, and had only slightly lower response in apomorphine stereotypy. Some of the responses ascribed to antidepressant action of rTMS in animal experiment may be due to environmental conditions, and not alternating magnetic field passing the brain. Key words: rTMS, antidepressant action, methodological problems Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been recently introduced as a novel antidepressant treatment, alternative to electroconvulsive treatment. The first very enthusiastic reports [6] have not been later completely confirmed [2], but rTMS is still regarded as potentially valuable antidepressant treatment. In animal experiment rTMS was found to produce behavioral and biochemical effects similar, though weaker, to those produced by electroconvulsive shock (ECS) [4, 7]. However, the results also were not completely reproducible, and our recent data (unpublished results) indicate that the shortening of the immobility time in the Porsolt’s test in rats after rTMS [see 8] cannot be always observed. Although rTMS is regarded as relatively noninvasive technique, comparing with electroconvulsive treatment, the animal experiments are carried out in conditions, in which the animals must be restricted and exposed to a considerable noise emitted by the apparatus. Those conditions may affect the animals, and when we noticed that control rat...|$|R
40|$|The SALSA {{receiver}} uses a 2. 3 m {{parabolic antenna}} steerable in azimuth and <b>elevation</b> by <b>motor</b> driven mount. A horn with a probe integrated with a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) is {{mounted in the}} focus of the parabola. The horn and the antenna are optimized for 1420 MHz, which is the frequency at which atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way is emitting. This Master thesis, entitled "Digital Receiver for SALSA", describes the upgrade of the existing receiver and antenna control. We designed the new digital receiver system that use a reconfigurable I/O (RIO) FPGA in conjunction with antenna control software and a software receiver (Software-Defined-Radio or SDR). The purpose of upgrading the system was to include some enhancements in the antenna controller {{as well as in the}} receiver. In the previous system a C program just worked as a GUI for the user, taking data and sending it to a microcontroller based hardware system, which decodes this data signal and sends appropriate signal to the antenna mount and then reads feedback encoder. In this project, a flexible and scalable software is realized to replace this complicated hardware. In the upgraded receiver, a Antenna Motion Controller software completely controls antenna. The software is designed in such a way that it does not miss even a single feedback pulse (there are 4 feedback pulses in one degree). The accuracy factor of software is 0. 25 degrees. The old receiver was hardware-based, thus every new configuration required new hardware. However, in our case, the software receiver is highly flexible in which a wide range of configuration is possible without changing or upgrading existing hardware. The new receiver also works in real-time mode (real-time signal processing) while the old one used to do store-and-process. This upgrade reduces the user interaction to continuously obtain signal spectra, and also minimizes the hardware needs...|$|R

Gander and Chamberlain quote a weight of only [...] for these guns, presumably accounting for the extra volume of the enlarged chamber. An armored single mount, the Bettungsschiessgerüst (Firing platform) C/39 was used by these guns. It had a maximum elevation of 60° and could traverse up to 360°, depending on the emplacement.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} {{describes}} all the developmental {{work of an}} automated surveying tracking theodolite referred to as The Anglescan Tracking System. This system consists of an optical system, an electronic system (with detailed schematics and printed circuit artwork, included) the software system which is approximately 100 pages of C source code, system identification and controller simulation, modelling and design, and finally instrument calibration and testing effort over a 2 year period. The project is a collaboration between the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the School of Surveying at the University of Tasmania. It is supported by an ARC university research fund granted to the School of Surveying over a two year period. The initial investigation into the feasibility {{of the project was}} carried out by Dr. A. Sprent, then at the North East London Polytechnic (Sprent, 1. 12). During this time the optical system of the instrument was developed. Following this investigation, it was decided to further undertake the continuation of the project as a Master's Degree in order to develop the electronics, measurement, tracking and control software. The Anglescan system is similar to a standard surveying theodolite mounted on a tripod and capable of determining the position of a retro-reflective mirror based within the instrument's field of view with respect with its optical centre of field (in both azimuth and elevation planes). This involves a new and different technique for target location than the currently existing electronic theodolites (see sections 1. 5, 1. 6). One of the main advantages of this method is the improved target locating accuracy, it has been field tested with an accuracy of + 1 - 1 second of arc, and simplicity in optical design. The disadvantages however include increased complexity of both the hardware (electronics), software, and calibration involved. The instrument deviates from a standard theodolite in that it has been fitted with precision DC servomotor drives on the azimuth and elevation axes for target tracking. The servomotors also include optical rotary encoders for measurement [...] While tracking, the system operates by continuously locating the target mirror with respect to its centre of field of view, then applying a feedback control signal to the azimuth and <b>elevation</b> <b>motors</b> in order to re-centre the instrument directly onto the target, this is updated at a rate of 30 samples/second. Part of the objectives of this work is to design the necessary hardware and software to achieve this task, this includes the design of a return (laser) analog signal processor card, the design of a target position measurement card, and azimuth/elevation servo motors interface cards (azimuth card and elevation card). Furthermore, the project also requires the design of an appropriate target acquisition and control loop strategy to allow smooth and accurate tracking of a moving target. A number of control system designs have been investigated, including proportional control, pole placement design and linear quadratic control. We have also used system identification techniques to obtain an accurate model of the plant which is necessary for controller design and simulation. To achieve the high precision required in measurement, it is necessary to calibrate the instrument. The calibration method is a complex procedure which uses least squares techniques to produce the required calibration accuracy (this is discussed in detail in section 5). The instrument finds applications in areas such as monitoring earth movements, motion of large structures such as building and bridges, locating earth working machinery such as tractors, bulldozers, graders, concrete and asphalt paving machines where an accurate level surface is required. Another application of particular interest is in surface contour mapping where we require to map a 3 dimensional surface (obtain the surface contour or topography), this application is a slightly more complex problem requiring the use of two instruments, this then becomes a multivariable control problem. As a result of this research work, one paper was presented at the IREECON - 91 conference in Sydney and is published in the proceedings [Dirita 1. 13]. Another paper was presented at the CONTROL- 92 conference held in Perth in November 1992 and is published in the proceedings [Dirita 4. 4]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is not only}} a potent angiogenic factor but it also {{promotes}} axonal outgrowth and proliferation of Schwann cells. The aim {{of the present study was}} to quantitatively assess reinnervation of musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) stumps using motor and primary sensory neurons after plasmid phVEGF transfection and end-to-end (ETE) or end-to-side (ETS) neurorrhaphy. The distal stump of rat transected MCN, was transfected with plasmid phVEGF, plasmid alone or treated with vehiculum and reinnervated following ETE or ETS neurorrhaphy for 2 months. The number of motor and dorsal root ganglia neurons reinnervating the MCN stump was estimated following their retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Ruby and Fluoro-Emerald. Reinnervation of the MCN stumps was assessed based on density, diameter and myelin sheath thickness of regenerated axons, grooming test and the wet weight index of the biceps brachii muscles. Results Immunohistochemical detection under the same conditions revealed increased VEGF in the Schwann cells of the MCN stumps transfected with the plasmid phVEGF, as opposed to control stumps transfected with only the plasmid or treated with vehiculum. The MCN stumps transfected with the plasmid phVEGF were reinnervated by moderately higher numbers of motor and sensory neurons after ETE neurorrhaphy compared with control stumps. However, morphometric quality of myelinated axons, grooming test and the wet weight index were significantly better in the MCN plasmid phVEGF transfected stumps. The ETS neurorrhaphy of the MCN plasmid phVEGF transfected stumps in comparison with control stumps resulted in significant <b>elevation</b> of <b>motor</b> and sensory neurons that reinnervated the MCN. Especially noteworthy was the increased numbers of neurons that sent out collateral sprouts into the MCN stumps. Similarly to ETE neurorrhaphy, phVEGF transfection resulted in significantly higher morphometric quality of myelinated axons, behavioral test and the wet weight index of the biceps brachii muscles. Conclusion Our results showed that plasmid phVEGF transfection of MCN stumps could induce an increase in VEGF protein in Schwann cells, which resulted in higher quality axon reinnervation after both ETE and ETS neurorrhaphy. This was also associated with a better wet weight biceps brachii muscle index and functional tests than in control rats. </p...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cortical}} myoclonus {{may have}} purely focal or multifocal jerks, {{or they may}} have additional bilateral or generalized jerks, suggesting the spread of excitatory myoclonic activity between the cerebral hemispheres and across the sensorimotor cortex. The factors contributing to this spread of activity were investigated in 10 patients with multifocal cortical myoclonus and eight patients with multifocal and bilateral or generalized cortical myoclonus. The two groups were termed 'non- spreaders' and 'spreaders' respectively. Eight of the patients were also epileptic. Motor thresholds to single transcranial magnetic shocks at rest were higher in 'non- spreaders' (median 88 %, range 45 - 100 % of stimulator output) than either 'spreaders' (50 %, range 26 - 90 %, P= 0. 023) or health controls (38 %, range 28 - 53 %, P< 0. 001). This pathological <b>elevation</b> in <b>motor</b> threshold was not simply an effect of treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Paired transcranial magnetic stimuli were used to investigate ipsilateral cortico-cortical and transcallosal inhibition, There was less (MANOVA, P< 0. 05) ipsilateral inhibition at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1 - 6 ms in 'spreaders' (mean 107 +/-SEM 23 % of control) compared with 'non- spreaders' (75 +/- 15 %) or healthy subjects (59 +/- 10 %). There was also less (P< 0. 05) transcallosal inhibition across inhibitory timings (10, 12 and 14 ms) in the 'spreaders' (98 +/- 6 % of control) compared with the 'non-spreaders' (64 +/- 8 %) or healthy subjects (59 +/- 6 %). There was no relationship between ipsilateral cortico-cortical and transcallosal inhibition and {{the presence or absence}} of epilepsy, although non-epileptic patients did have higher motor thresholds (median 85 %, range 32 - 100 % of stimulator output) than either epileptic patients (50 %, range 26 - 90 %, P< 0. 001) or healthy controls (38 %, range 28 - 53 %, P= 0. 002). Abnormalities in ipsilateral and transcallosal inhibition appear to facilitate the spread of the cortical myoclonic activity responsible for bilateral and generalized jerks. However, these abnormalities in inhibition do not play a major role in the development of generalized seizures in patients with cortical myoclonus...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the degree of overlap among these disorders in discrete subfacets of impulsivity and whether any overlap is purely phenotypic or due to shared genetic diathesis. We focused on five subfacets of impulsivity: self-reported attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsivity, self-reported sensation seeking, and a behavioral measure of motor inhibition (stop signal reaction time; SSRT). We examined these facets within and across disorder proband and co-twin groups, modeled heritability, and tested for endophenotypic patterning in a sample of twin pairs recruited from the Swedish Twin Registry (N = 420). We found evidence of moderate to high levels of heritability for all five subfacets. All three proband groups and their unaffected co-twins showed <b>elevations</b> on attentional, <b>motor,</b> and non-planning impulsivity. Schizophrenia probands (but not their co-twins) showed significantly lower sensation seeking, and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder probands (but not in their co-twins) had significantly longer SSRTs, compared with healthy controls and the other groups. Attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsivity emerged as potential shared endophenotypes for the three disorders, whereas sensation seeking and SSRT were associated with phenotypic affection but not genetic loading for these disorders...|$|R
