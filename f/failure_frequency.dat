40|$|Abstract — The {{reliability}} of the grid connected photovoltaic system is primarily and strongly depends on the {{reliability of}} the electrical protection systems, failure of which may lead to fire.

A literature review of reliability data of fire detection system was made resulting to rough estimates of some <b>failure</b> <b>frequencies.</b> No theoretical or technical articles on the structure of reliability models of these installations were found. In this paper the classifications of failure severity were made from the system point of view by counting failures of components when possible.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} approximating the <b>failure</b> <b>frequency</b> of large-scale composite $k$-terminal reliability systems. In such systems, the nodes ($k$ of which are terminals) are connected through components which are subject to random failure and repair processes. At any time, a system failure occurs if the surviving system fails to connect all the k terminals together. We assume that each component's up-times and down-times follow statistically independent stationary random processes, and these processes are statistically independent across the components. In this setting, the exact computation of <b>failure</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is known to be}} computationally intractable (NP-hard). In this work, we present an algorithm to approximate the <b>failure</b> <b>frequency</b> for any given multiplicative error factor that runs in polynomial time in the number of (minimal) cutsets. Moreover, for the special case of all-terminal reliability systems, i. e., where all nodes are terminals, we propose an algorithm for approximating the <b>failure</b> <b>frequency</b> within an arbitrary multiplicative error that runs in polynomial time in the number of nodes (which can be much smaller than the number of cutsets).

For process plants, where Major Accident Hazard Legislation is enforced, even competent authorities’ decisions, such as licensing and land use planning LUP, are “risk based” and, consequently, driven by Failure Rates.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purposes}} of this paper are to perform piping failure analysis for the failed safety class piping in Korean nuclear power plants(NPPs) and evaluate the effect of an in-service inspection(ISI) on the piping failure probability. For data collection, a database for piping failure events was constructed with 135 data fields including population data, event data, and service history data. A total of 6 kinds of events with 25 failure cases up to June 30, 2003 were identified from Korean NPPs. The failed systems were main feedwater system, CVCS, primary sampling system, essential service water system, and CANDU purification system. Piping failure analyses such as evaluation of the impact on nuclear safety and piping integrity and the root cause analysis were performed and the piping <b>failure</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the failed piping were calculated by using population data. The result showed that although the integrity was not maintained in the failed piping, {{the safety of the}} plants was maintained for all the events. And the root causes of the events were analyzed as FAC, vibration, thermal fatigue, corrosion, and/or an improper weld joint. The piping <b>failure</b> <b>frequencies</b> ranged from 6. 08 E- 5 /Cr-Yr to 1. 15 E- 3 /Cr-Yr for the events. According to the ASME Code Sec.

The effect of ISI considering the pipe size on the piping failure probability was investigated by using the Win-PRAISE program based on probabilistic fracture mechanics.

40|$|Abstract. The current {{in-service}} inspection (ISI) {{strategy for the}} nuclear piping in many countries consists of both the code requirements such as ASME B & PV Code Sec. XI and the country-specific regulatory requirements, so called as the enhanced ISI. The enhanced ISI reflects the operating experience of piping failure, while the ASME Code Sec.

In this study, a new strategy for ISI of nuclear piping was proposed based on piping <b>failure</b> <b>frequency.</b> This strategy basically reflects the operating experience because the piping <b>failure</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is based on the}} piping failure database. The new concept of minimum inspection rate was also introduced in this new ISI strategy.

The results from the proposed new strategy were compared to those from the ASME Code Sec. XI. The results show that the new ISI strategy reasonably reflects the operating experience.

The analysis methodology is based on the American Lifelines Alliance seismic fragility formulations for water systems. System fragilities are convolved with the 1995 LANL seismic hazards to develop <b>failure</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Acceptance is determined by comparing the <b>failure</b> <b>frequencies</b> to the DOE- 1020 Performance Goals. This study concludes that: (1) If a significant number of existing isolation valves in the water distribution system are closed to dedicate the entire water system to fighting fires in specific nuclear facilities; (2) Then, the water distribution systems for WETF, RLWTF, WCRRF, and TWISP meet the PC- 2 performance goal and the water distribution system for CMR is capable of surviving a 0. 06 g earthquake. A parametric study of the WETF water distribution system demonstrates that: (1) If a significant number of valves in the water distribution system are NOT closed to dedicate the entire water system to fighting fires in WETF; (2) Then, the water distribution system for WETF has an annual probability of failure on the order of 4 x 10 {sup - 3 } that does not meet the PC- 2 performance goal.
