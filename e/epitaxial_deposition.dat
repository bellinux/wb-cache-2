40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Nucleation {{and growth}} {{kinetics}} of oxygen precipitates and bulk defects in epitaxial silicon wafers were investigated. Low temperature nucleation heat treatments {{were applied to}} the well characterized epitaxial silicon wafers {{before and after the}} <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposition</b> processing. Subsequently the wafers were heat treated at a high temperature. In the case of post-epitaxial nucleation heat treatment {{it was found that the}} heat treatment ambients have an effect on the growth of oxygen precipitates. However, the application of nucleation heat treatment can suppress this effect. The maximum bulk defect density in as-received epitaxial materials is limited by the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposition</b> process. In the case of pre-epitaxial annealing the effect of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposition</b> heat treatment can be retarded and a higher bulk defect density can be achieved.

Being attractive from the performance {{point of view}} they present certain technological challenges. One {{of them is the}} difficulty to control poly-gate encapsulation during the HF removal of native SiO 2 prior to the <b>epitaxial</b> Si <b>deposition</b> of raised sourse/drains.
