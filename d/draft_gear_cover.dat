It is observed that first five mode shapes of the individual draft pad are dominating the behaviour of each draft pad in the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> for all 15 mode shapes of the <b>draft</b> <b>gear.</b> This is because the draft pads housed in the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> have their own individual behaviour which cumulatively results in different mode shapes of the <b>draft</b> <b>gear.</b> These mode shapes of <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> as such have no resemblance with mode shapes of an individual draft pad.|$|R

The longitudinal force that the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> absorbs usually {{leads to the}} failure of its components, especially, the load bearing draft pads. Dynamic behaviour of an individual draft pad and a <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is determined and characterized with exciting frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. The effect of compressive prestress load on the dynamic behaviour of an individual draft pad is also determined as the draft pads in assembled state are under constant axial compressive force in the <b>draft</b> <b>gear.</b> The vibration characteristics of individual draft pad are compared with draft pads that are part of <b>draft</b> <b>gear.</b> The modal analysis gives us a basis for subjecting a draft pad to higher frequency loading for determining its fatigue behaviour.|$|R

The friction-type <b>draft</b> <b>gears</b> are the most widely used <b>draft</b> <b>gears.</b> The ever developing heavy haul transport environment requires further or new understanding of friction <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> behaviour and its implications for train dynamics as well as fatigue damage of rolling stock.

30|$|In this article, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} of draft pad and <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is investigated using finite element method. The <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> consists of six draft pads which are assembled in series (one above another) and are always under a constant axial compressive prestress in unloaded condition. Prestress influences {{the values of}} the stiffness matrix by causing stress stiffening and affects the response frequencies of the system thus impacting its modal responses [9]. The draft pad consists of a rubber compound/elastomer along with two steel plates. The modal behaviour of draft pad and <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> assumes significance as it is necessary to identify frequencies at which fatigue failure of draft pads can occur. The vibration characteristics of the draft pad and the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> for the first 15 modes have been determined using finite element method. The vibration excitation of an individual draft pad has been compared with the dynamics of draft pads in the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> for identifying various frequencies for a given mode shape.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} improve <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> designs for heavy haul trains.

30|$|In {{longitudinal}} train dynamics, <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} important component of the autocoupler. The autocoupler with friction type <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> {{is the most}} common wagon connection in the Australian and North American freight system [1]. Similar autocouplers with <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> are also used in the Indian freight system and their adoption in the freight system can be traced back in the early 1960 s. Mark- 50 was adopted in 1963, RF- 361 was adopted in 1965 and SL- 76 was adopted in 1977. Being {{an important part of the}} autocoupler system, the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> serves to absorb energy generated during the normal starting and braking of the freight railway wagon system and also during different train handling conditions, thus avoiding damage and failure of the coupling system. It thus functions as a passive vibration isolator to control and absorb high amplitude forces thereby avoiding damage to laden goods. The frequency of this longitudinal force depends on the train running condition and varies continuously.|$|R

30|$|The {{mode shapes}} and {{frequencies}} {{for an individual}} draft pad and a <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> have been obtained using finite element approach. It is seen that the mode shapes of draft pads in a <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> are dominated by the first five modes (Fig.  3) of an individual draft pad. For these dominant mode shapes of an individual draft pad, different values of frequencies (Table  3) of the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> have been identified. These values are different than the various values of frequency obtained for an individual pad. These different values of frequency assumes significances as the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is subjected to variable loading frequency due to acceleration and braking of the locomotive. Hence, a range of frequency values have been identified against which a draft pad must be tested for fatigue response. As per the schedule of technical requirements by Indian Railways [13], a draft pad is subjected to cyclic loading of 10  Hz for determining its fatigue behaviour. The values identified (Table  3) are greater than the existing value but have significance as {{the possibility that the}} frequency of cyclic load acting on the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> in actual operation will not exceed this specified value cannot be ruled out. The modal analysis thus gives us a basis for subjecting a draft pad to higher frequency loading for determining its fatigue behaviour.|$|R

30|$|Sixth {{mode shape}} shows {{oscillation}} of {{the interface between}} pad 3 and pad 4 about lateral (z) axis. As a result some draft pads exhibit third modal behaviour of individual draft pad. In the seventh mode shape, interfaces between pads 2 and 3, 4 and 5 remains fixed and interfaces between pads 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis causing every single pad to execute motion in accordance to first mode shape. The eight mode shape of <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is oscillation of all draft pad interfaces about lateral (z) axis. This oscillation results in fifth mode shape for all pads. For the ninth mode shape of <b>draft</b> <b>gear,</b> the interface between pads 3 and 4 remains fixed while the adjacent interfaces (i.e. interface between pads 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between pads 4 and 5, 5 and 6) oscillate in opposite direction. This mode thus causes all pads to behave in accordance to first mode shape. For the tenth mode shape of <b>draft</b> <b>gear,</b> interface between pads 2 and 3 and pads 4 and 5 oscillate between about vertical (y) axis in opposite phase. The resulting effect is that all pads execute second modal behaviour.|$|R

The work performed included a significant instrumented wagon based in-train force measurement program, combined with theoretical analysis achieved through computational simulation models. Aurizon’s coal wagons are operated in tandem pairs, each pair having a drawbar connection between the wagons and auto-coupler connections at the outermost ends. A significant change in recent times has been the introduction of short pack <b>draft</b> <b>gears</b> (polymer/elastomer springs without friction wedges) at the drawbar connections.

30|$|The {{longitudinal}} force that the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> absorbs usually {{leads to the}} failure of its components, especially, the draft pads. Garg and Dukkipati [2] specified the problems caused by {{longitudinal force}}s and attributed the failure of <b>draft</b> <b>gears</b> due to excessive longitudinal draft forces. Initial work on longitudinal train dynamics was aimed towards reducing longitudinal oscillations in passenger train. Work done in this context involved measurement and simulation of in-train forces to reduce longitudinal oscillations [3]. The relation between lateral coupler force components and wheel unloading were studied by El-Sibaie [4] and a new method was proposed for evaluating the curving stability of any freight railway car under buff and draw conditions. Chen [5] proposed a mathematical model to calculate transient responses of the coupler, whereas McClanachan et al. [6] conducted experiments to determine the occurrences of coupler impacts combined with pitching motions in the wagon body. Then these interactions were simulated using NUCARS, ADAMS/Rail and a train-wagon interaction model. Cole and Sun [7] evaluated fatigue life of autocoupler systems with and without self-locking features of the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> for three types of wagon connection coupling systems.

40|$|Whole trip {{longitudinal}} {{dynamics and}} energy analysis of heavy haul trains {{are required by}} operators and manufacturers to enable optimisation of train controls and rolling stock components. A new technology named train dynamics and energy analyser/train simulator (TDEAS) has been developed by the State Key Laboratory of Traction Power in China to perform detailed whole trip longitudinaltrain dynamics and energy analyses. Facilitated bya controller user interface and a graphic user interface, the TDEAS {{can also be used}} as a train driving simulator. This paper elaborates the modelling of three primary parts in the TDEAS, namely wagon connection systems, air brake systems and train energy components. TDEAS uses advanced wedge-spring <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> models that can simulate a wider spectrum of friction <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> behaviour. An effective and efficient air brake model that can simulate air brake systems in various train configurations has been integrated. In addition, TDEAS simulates the train energy {{on the basis of a}} detailed longitudinal train dynamics simulation, which enables a further perspective of the trainenergy composition and the overall energy consumption. To demonstrate the validity of the TDEAS, a case study was carried out on a 120 -km-long Chinese railway. The results show that the employment of electric locomotives with regenerative braking could bring considerable energy benefits. Nearly 40 % of the locomotive energy usage could be collected from the dynamic brake system.
