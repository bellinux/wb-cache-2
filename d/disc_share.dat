40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest the {{existence}} in the central regions of spiral galaxies of collisionless, scale-free, rigidly rotating, self-gravitating discs with spiral symmetry. Such discs must be truncated at a finite radius, {{and they must be}} stabilized and rendered self-similar by a suitable halo. The halo and the rotating <b>disc</b> <b>share</b> the self-similar class and must form together to arrive at the suggested state. We make comparisons with the well-known rigidly rotating, Kalnajs discs; one of which is axi-symmetric and finite while the other is infinite and decomposed into spiral modes. We find the self-consistent, self-similar, distribution functions in one and two dimensions in a rigidly rotating, collisionless system. In the case of two dimensions we deduce the self-consistency condition for discrete spiral arms. We give an estimate of the disturbance created in the halo by the presence of the disc, and argue that the halo itself should be close to self-similarity. A very weak cusp in the halo may be necessary. The necessary spatial coincidence of the halo results in a kind of disc-halo `conspiracy'. Finally the disc equations are formulated in `spiral' coordinates, and the passage to an approximately discrete `line spiral' is given as an example. Although in two dimensions the collisionless particles enter and leave the arms in non-linear epicycles, they move approximately parallel to the arms in the line spiral limit. The spiral pattern is however in rigid rotation. Aperiodic spiral arms are suggested wherein discontinuities may be coarse-grained to appear as collisionless shocks...|$|E

Simple phenomenological models of both CO(3 - 2) and 350 GHz continuum emissions are presented, requiring the use of only very few parameters.

40|$|We {{present the}} radial {{profiles}} of the Hβ, Mg and Fe line-strength indices for a sample of eight spiral galaxies with a low-surface-brightness stellar disc and a bulge. The correlations between the central values of the line-strength indices and velocity dispersion {{are consistent with those}} known for early-type galaxies and bulges of high-surface-brightness galaxies. The age, metallicity and α/Fe enhancement of the stellar populations in the bulge-dominated region are obtained using stellar population models with variable element abundance ratios. Almost all the sample bulges are characterized by a young stellar population, ongoing star formation and a solar α/Fe enhancement. Their metallicity spans from high to subsolar values. No significant gradient in age and α/Fe enhancement is measured, whereas a negative metallicity gradient is found only in a few cases. These properties suggest that a pure dissipative collapse cannot explain the formation of all the sample bulges and that other phenomena, such as mergers or acquisition events, need to be invoked. Such a picture is also supported by the lack of a correlation between the central value and the gradient of the metallicity in bulges with very low metallicity.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{properties}} of a sample of 67 very blue and likely young massive clusters in M 31 extracted from the Bologna Revised Catalog of globular clusters, selected according to their color [(B − V) o ≤ 0. 45] and/or {{to the strength of}} their Hβ spectral index (Hβ ≥ 3. 5 ˚A). Their existence in M 31 has been noted by several authors in the past; we show here that these Blue Luminous Compact Clusters (BLCCs) are a significant fraction (� 15 %) of the whole globular cluster system of M 31. Compared to the global properties of the M 31 globular cluster system, they appear to be intrinsically fainter, morphologically less concentrated, and with a shallower Balmer jump and enhanced Hβ absorption in their spectra. Empirical comparison with integrated properties of clusters with known age as well as with theoretical SSP models consistently indicate that their typical age is less than ∼ 2 Gyr, while they probably are not so metal-poor as deduced if considered to be old. Either selecting BLCCs by their (B − V) o colors or by the strength of their Hβ index the cluster sample turns out to be distributed onto the outskirts of M 31 <b>disc,</b> <b>sharing</b> the kinematical properties of the thin, rapidly rotating disc component.

40|$|Silks play an {{important}} role in the life of various arthropods. A highly neglected prerequisite to make versatile use of silks is sufficient attachment to substrates. Although there have been some studies on the structure and mechanics of silk anchorages of spiders, for insects only anecdotal reports on attachment-associated spinning behaviour exist. Here, we experimentally studied the silk attachment of the pupae and last instar caterpillars of the tea bagworm Eumeta minuscula (Butler 1881) (Lepidoptera, Psychidae) to the leaves of its host plant Ilex chinensis. We found that the bagworms spin attachment <b>discs,</b> which <b>share</b> some structural features with those of spiders, like a plaque consisting of numerous overlaid, looped glue-coated silk fibres and the medially attaching suspension thread. Although the glue, which coats the fibres, cannot spread and adhere very well to the leaf surface, high pull-off forces were measured, yielding a mean safety factor (force divided by the animal weight) of 385. 6. Presumably, the bagworms achieve this by removal of the leaf epidermis prior to silk attachment, which exposes the underlying tissue that represents a much better bonding site. This ensures a reliable attachment during the immobile, vulnerable pupal stage. This is the first study on the biomechanics and structure of silk attachments to substrates in insects. 6 page(s...|$|R

The BBC proposed to ensure compliance with copy-protection standards on the upgraded Freeview HD multiplex by compressing the service information (SI) data, which receivers need to understand the TV services in the data stream. To encourage boxes to adopt copy protection, the BBC made its own look-up tables and decompression algorithm, necessary for decoding the EPG data on high-definition channels, available without charge only to manufacturers who implement the copy-protection technology. This technology would control the way HD films and TV shows are copied onto, for example Blu-ray <b>discs,</b> and <b>shared</b> with others over the internet.

The Tables are transmitted over a UDP network between DTM servers in network format, where the servers perform the conversions to and from host format for local clients. The servers provide clients with synchronization mechanisms, a choice of network data flows, and table options such as keeping table <b>disc</b> copies, <b>shared</b> memory or heap memory table allocation, table read/write permissions, and table subnet broadcasting. DTM has been designed to be easily maintainable, and to automatically recover from the type of errors typically encountered in a large control system network. The DTM system is based on a three level server daemon hierarchy, in which an inter daemon protocol handles network failures, and incorporates recovery procedures which will guarantee table consistency when communications are re-established. These protocols are implemented over a communications layer which performs the data conversions, packet splitting, error-correction with retry, and time out handling. The same communications layer is used to implement the application program interface which calls on the server daemon for client services. DTM is a registration based system, in which communications are established dynamically as needed, and tables are distributed only to the clients who have registered their interest in them. The registration protocols include mechanisms to recover from daemon re-launches, and clean up after aborted clients...|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{the local}} flux {{of dark matter}} {{particles}} is vital for dark matter direct detection experiments. To date, such predictions {{have been based on}} simulations that model the dark matter alone. Here we include the influence of the baryonic matter for the first time. We use two different approaches. Firstly, we use dark matter only simulations to estimate the expected merger history for a Milky Way mass galaxy, and then add a thin stellar disc to measure its effect. Secondly, we use three cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies. In both cases, we find that a stellar/gas disc at high redshift (z ∼ 1) causes merging satellites to be preferentially dragged towards the disc plane. This results in an accreted dark matter disc that contributes ∼ 0. 25 − 1 times the non-rotating halo density at the solar position. An associated thick stellar disc forms with the dark <b>disc</b> and <b>shares</b> a similar velocity distribution. If these accreted stars can be separated from those that formed in situ, future astronomical surveys will be able to infer the properties of the dark disc from these stars. The dark disc, unlike dark matter streams, is an equilibrium structure that must exist in disc galaxies that form in a hierarchical cosmology. Its low rotation lag with respect to the Earth significantly boosts WIMP capture in the Earth and Sun, increases the likelihood of direct detection at low recoil energy, boosts the annual modulation signal, and leads to distinct variations in the flux as a function of recoil energy that allow the WIMP mass to be determined (see contribution from T.

Human intramedullary myelopathies/cavitations are associated with severe initial SCI and deterioration of clinical signs. Canine intervertebral <b>disc</b> extrusions <b>share</b> similarities with SCI in humans. In this descriptive study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in spinal cords of dogs suffering from chronic post-traumatic myelopathies, including cavitations, are elucidated. An additional aim {{of the study was}} to compare diagnostic imaging and histopathological findings and identify similarities between human and canine chronic post-traumatic spinal cord lesions. Thirty-seven dogs with thoracolumbar SCI and one or more 3 Tesla MRI investigations more than 3 weeks after SCI were included. Extent of intramedullary lesions and particularly cavitations were evaluated and measured in sagittal and transverse MRI planes. These data were compared with clinical data. A total of 91. 9 % of study patients developed chronic intramedullary lesions, and 86. 5 % developed intramedullary cavitations. Paraplegia without deep pain perception at initial examination was significantly associated with longer chronic myelopathies/cavitations (P = 0. 002 /P = 0. 008), and with larger maximal cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the lesions (P = 0. 041 / 0. 005). In addition, a non-ambulatory status after decompressive surgery was also associated with the development of longer intramedullary lesions/cavitations (P< 0. 001) and larger lesion mCSA (P< 0. 001 /P = 0. 012). All dogs with negative outcome developed myelopathies/cavitations. In the group of 21 dogs with positive outcome, 3 did not develop any myelopathies, and 5 did not develop cavitations. Development of chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations are common findings in canine SCI. Extensive chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations reflect a severe initial SCI and negative clinical outcome. This supports the hypothesis that chronic spinal cord changes following SCI in humans share similarities with canine chronic spinal cord changes after spontaneous intervertebral disc extrusion...|$|R

40|$|In a large Scottish {{family a}} high {{incidence}} of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder co-segregates with a balanced autosomal translocation (t(1; 11) (q 42. 1;q 14. 3). The translocation disrupts Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia- 1 (DISC 1) and DISC 2 on chromosome 1, and DISC 1 FP 1 (Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-Fusion-Partner- 1), also known as Boymaw, on chromosome 11. DISC 1 is a leading candidate gene for major mental illness and is involved in neurodevelopment and cellular signalling, whilst DISC 2 and DISC 1 FP 1 are apparently non-coding RNA genes that undergo alternative splicing and that are expressed in the brain. This thesis aimed to investigate putative mechanisms of pathogenesis that may result from the t(1; 11), with the hope that pathogenic mechanisms identified in the t(1; 11) pedigree might shed light upon mechanisms conferring risk for psychiatric illness in the wider population. Previous work had identified DISC 1 /DISC 1 FP 1 chimeric transcripts in t(1; 11) -family derived lymphoblastoid cell lines. The detected transcripts include CP 60 and CP 69 which encode DISC 1 aa 1 - 597 plus an additional 60 or 69 amino acids from DISC 1 FP 1, respectively. In this thesis a novel DISC 1 /DISC 1 FP 1 transcript, CP 1, was identified in t(1; 11) lymphoblastoid cell lines. The CP 1 transcript encodes DISC 1 aa 1 - 597 plus one glycine. A truncated form of DISC 1 comprising aa 1 - 597 was previously suggested to be a putative product of the translocation and, as such, {{has been the focus of}} multiple studies. The identification of the CP 1 species is of interest as it differs from DISC 1 aa 1 - 597, by only a glycine.

40|$|Context. During {{the course}} of a large spectroscopic survey of X-ray active late-type stars in the solar neighbourhood, we {{discovered}} four lithium-rich stars packed within just a few degrees on the sky. Although located in a sky area rich in CO molecular regions and dark clouds, the Cepheus-Cassiopeia complex, these very young stars are projected several degrees away from clouds in front of an area void of interstellar matter. As such, they are very good "isolated" T Tauri star candidates. Aims. We present optical observations of these stars conducted with 1 - 2 m class telescopes. We acquired high-resolution optical spectra as well as photometric data allowing us to investigate in detail their nature and physical parameters with the aim of testing the "runaway" and "in-situ" formation scenarios.

We use the cross-correlation technique and other tools developed by us to derive accurate radial and rotational velocities and perform an automatic spectral classification. The spectral subtraction technique is used to infer chromospheric activity level in the Hα line core and clean the spectra of photospheric lines before measuring the equivalent width of the lithium absorption line. Results. Both physical (lithium content, chromospheric, and coronal activities) and kinematical indicators show that all stars are very young, with ages probably in the range 10 - 30 Myr. In particular, the spectral energy distribution of TYC 4496 - 780 - 1 displays a strong near-and far-infrared excess, typical of T Tauri stars still surrounded by an accretion <b>disc.</b> They also <b>share</b> the same Galactic motion, proving that they form a homogeneous moving group of stars with the same origin. Conclusions. The most plausible explanation of how these "isolated" T Tauri stars formed is the "in-situ" model, although accurate distances are needed to clarify their connection with the Cepheus-Cassiopeia complex. The discovery of this loose association of "isolated" T Tauri stars can help to shed light on atypical formation processes of stars and planets in low-mass clouds...|$|R
