500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she}} liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found [...] "Leslie's House" [...] slower than {{previous}} episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused.

Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in Parks and Recreation differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way.|$|E
