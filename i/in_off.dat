5|$|In November 2010, Walker joined League Two side Stevenage on loan until January 2011. He {{made his}} club debut {{just a day}} after signing for the club, {{starting}} in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at AFC Wimbledon. It {{was to be a}} scoring debut for Walker, scoring a free-kick that went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> the post to give Stevenage the lead in a 2–0 victory. He made his first league appearance for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town in December 2010, a game in which Walker hit the crossbar from a free-kick. Despite being due to stay at Stevenage until the beginning of January 2011, Walker was recalled by his parent club Watford on 23 December, in order to provide cover for the injured Stephen McGinn. Walker made two appearances for Stevenage, scoring one goal, as his loan spell at the club was disrupted by fixture postponements.|$|E

5|$|The hosts Arsenal played Paris Saint-Germain in {{the later}} game. Although the {{visitors}} dominated play in the first 45 minutes, they went behind at the cusp of half-time, when Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini scored. He collected the ball from Nicklas Bendtner and his first-time shot went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> the post. Wenger tweaked his team's formation after the break from their customary 4–4–2 to 4–4–1–1 and made five changes to his team. He positioned right-back Emmanuel Eboué as a midfielder, and Alexander Hleb behind Bendtner. Arsenal's performance improved {{in the second half}} and they doubled their lead through Bendtner in the 70th minute. Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia immediately denied Pauleta with a stretching save at the far post, but could not prevent Péguy Luyindula from scoring. Arsenal held on to win by two goals.|$|E

5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping <b>in</b> <b>off</b> the open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.|$|E
