[...] "You <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I do,...

You guys <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E

Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun.

500|$|In 1990, Lundgren {{starred in}} Craig R. Baxley's sci-fi thriller I Come in Peace (also known as Dark Angel) {{opposite}} Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues and Jay Bilas. Lundgren plays Jack Caine, a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, {{who does not}} let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission {{to wipe out the}} White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while he was waylaid stopping a convenience store robbery. Lundgren said of his role, [...] "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than just action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act.

There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews.

But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight.

Votta said that [...] "what we got" [...] was [...] "wonderfully done, and a perfect balance of Darren Criss and Chris Colfer's musical strengths", but she was perplexed that they [...] "cut the verses most relevant to Santana" [...] yet [...] "kept the cheeky rap bridge". In contrast, she thought Puck's performance of [...] "I'm the Only One" [...] was [...] "the most awkward thing Glee has done in a while, and drags on forever", though she added that Salling sounded [...] "great". Slezak expressed the wish that Puck would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "a mashup or an interesting arrangement", and gave the song a [...] "C+", while Futterman said the song was [...] "a strain on his voice" [...] and the presentation [...] "another cookie-cutter classroom setting".

500|$|Mirkin {{directed}} the feature film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion in 1997. The film stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as two friends determined {{to show their}} former high school tormentors at their 10-year reunion that they have led successful lives. Mirkin said of the film: [...] "These are women characters we haven't seen before. There are so few female buddy movies, written funny for women. Women don't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> odd, strange, self-involved roles like these." [...] He knew Kudrow previously and felt she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role, but did not expect Sorvino would take the part given her recent Academy Award win for Mighty Aphrodite, but it [...] "turn out that she'd had a horrible time in high school, so the story appealed to her". The film received critical praise, as did Mirkin's direction. James Berardinelli wrote that Mirkin [...] "brings {{a lot of energy}} to the production, always keeping things moving", while Jack Matthews of The Los Angeles Times says Mirkin [...] "knew exactly what he had here and composed it like frames in a comic strip, ordering cheerful snow-cone colors for everything from the girls' childlike outfits to the decor of a Laundromat".|$|E

You don’t <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E
500|$|... "The Negotiation" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz.

Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a sudden, he wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself.

500|$|... "Duets" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics, {{many of whom}} contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes. The New York Times Rebecca Milzoff called it {{the best of the}} season to that point [...] "in terms of old-school Glee", and indeed, both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized: [...] "This was a return to that honeymoon feeling, when Glee first surprised, scandalized and satisfied you." [...] TV Guide Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks; the former explained [...] "No Britney numbers. No forced guest stars. No reasons to check out. It's amazing how satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something more than set-dress a stunt." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labelled it [...] "easily the strongest character episode so far this season". While The Atlantic Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct [...] "tonal balance of comedy and drama", his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews; she called it a lazy, nonsensical episode which contributed to a building [...] "sophomore slump". MTV's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after [...] "Grilled Cheesus", and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode, he concluded that it was not one of the season's best.|$|E

The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E
