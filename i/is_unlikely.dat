5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant {{would be an}} individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E

5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
