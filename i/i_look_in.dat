500|$|São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni {{was named}} as {{man of the}} match and also won the Golden Ball as the best player of the competition. Ceni was gracious in {{receiving}} the awards stating: [...] "The awards are nice to have but the win was not just about me" [...] Ceni dedicated the awards to those at the club saying: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> these awards I see the faces of my team-mates, the coach and everyone involved at the club." [...] São Paulo manager was delighted with his team after the victory and agreed with Ceni that the victory was a team effort: [...] "It was a collective victory" [...] {{he also said that}} it was [...] "a great achievement for the club." [...] Goalscorer Mineiro was equally overjoyed with the victory stating: [...] "It is the happiest moment in my career." ...|$|E
500|$|While at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth {{is shocked}} to find she is unable to remove the mask and that the mask has, in fact, become her face. She returns {{to the store and}} finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the [...] "mask" [...] is {{actually}} a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them, but they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a [...] "symbol of love", but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, [...] "How do <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> your mask?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Though less a soundtrack {{and more}} of a {{companion}} album, the Idlewild album features seven songs from the Idlewild film: [...] "Chronomentrophobia", [...] "Makes No Sense at All", [...] "PJ and Rooster", [...] "Greatest Show on Earth", [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> Your Eyes", and, from the end credits, [...] "Morris Brown". Two snippets of film dialogue are also included on the album as interludes. The rest of the songs performed in the film were included on the earlier OutKast LPs Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. In an interview for Billboard, Big Boi stated [...] "This is an OutKast album. It isn't like a soundtrack where we go get this person or that person".|$|E

6000|$|... "My spirits {{have risen}} since the doctor left me. There is a {{pleasant}} sensation {{of security in}} feeling that no strangers are in possession of my address. I am easy enough in my mind to-day to notice how wonderfully well <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> my widow's weeds, and to make myself agreeable {{to the people of}} the house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am so glad--I {{was just}} coming down,' Cornelia {{said in a}} whisper; {{whenever}} they spoke as relations in this house it was in whispers. 'Now, {{how do you think}} this bonnet will do? May I come down, and see how <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> your big glass?' She clapped the bonnet upon her head. 'Won't it do beautiful for Sunday afternoon?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was one of}} them," [...] says Mr. Tulkinghorn, {{carelessly}} feeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in {{the wrong}} coat-pocket, [...] "the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather like. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> to ask you--but I haven't got it. No matter, any other time will do. Ah! here it is! <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> to ask you who copied this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None," [...] Elma answered, with a calmly {{resigned}} air. [...] "I {{only know}} it; I {{know it from}} his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> them once and read it like a book. But of course that's nothing. What we must do now {{is to try and}} find out the facts. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> his eyes and I saw it at a glance. And I saw he saw it. He knows I've discovered him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at the Brabants' {{for some}} midnight tea before I came on here. They'd got some writers--and Grant was there." ...|$|R
60|$|The devil works {{precisely}} {{in the same}} way. He is a very clever fellow; I have no acquaintance with him, but I respect his evident talents. Consistent truth and goodness will assuredly in the end overcome every thing; but inconsistent good can never be a match for consistent evil. Alas! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> vain for some wise and vigorous man to sound the word Duty in the ears of this generation.|$|E
6000|$|Heigho! I would I were in mine island!--I am not well; and yet <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> good health. At times, I fear, [...] "I {{am not in}} my perfect mind;" [...] [4]--and yet {{my heart}} and head have stood many a crash, and what should ail them now? They prey upon themselves, and I am sick--sick--"Prithee, undo this button--why should a cat, a rat, a dog have life--and thou no life at all?" [...] [5] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is it all}} about, anyway, Reginald?" [...] {{his sister}} asked. [...] "I have heard more than once but I have forgotten. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the paper for a divorce case, I nearly always see your name against the King, or the King against you, with a person named Vont also interested. Surely the Vont family have been {{retainers}} down at Mandeleys for generations? I remember one of them perfectly well." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{face flushed}} with answer as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} indicated, and there saw in earnest converse with the Britishers, Elias Macomber, the traitor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't be down there," [...] replied Allan, [...] "as {{the cabin}} {{was full of}} water. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> and saw it, {{and shut the door}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," [...] cried <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> amazement at {{this man}} who was forever {{confounding}} me with some new phase of his astuteness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} in my last" [...] (he wrote), [...] "that the {{discoloration}} of my skin had begun. The complexion which you were once so good as to admire, has disappeared for ever. I am now of a livid ashen color--so like death, that I sometimes startle myself when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the glass. In about six weeks more, as the doctor calculates, this will deepen to a blackish blue; and then, 'the saturation' (as he calls it) will be complete.|$|E
6000|$|... "She was right! I am {{sure she}} was right," [...] wailed the prisoner. [...] "But Ruggedo wanted to injure me--to make me ugly {{in the eyes of}} all the world--so he {{performed}} a wicked enchantment. I went to bed beautiful--or you might say handsome--to be very modest I will merely claim that I was good-looking--and I wakened the next morning the homeliest man in all the world! I am so repulsive that when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> a mirror I frighten myself." ...|$|E
60|$|I may {{perhaps be}} allowed to add in this place, that I have not yet seen or heard of my {{portrait}} in an engraved state. Professor Tizzi is still alive; but <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> vain through the publishers' lists for an announcement of his learned work on the Vital Principle. Possibly he may be adding a volume or two to the twelve already completed, by way of increasing the debt which a deeply obliged posterity is, sooner or later, sure of owing to him.|$|E
60|$|There was a glass {{over the}} mantel-piece in the anteroom. I lingered {{for a moment}} (nervous as I was) to see how <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the glass.|$|R
60|$|I {{stopped him}} {{on our way}} out to take {{advantage}} of my uncle's advice; in other words, to see how <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the glass over the vestry fireplace.|$|R

60|$|Only in a {{house of}} habitually inattentive men could any one talk such {{nonsense}} without reproof, but <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> vain through Hansard's record of this debate for a single contemptuous reference to Mr. Chamberlain's obtuseness. And {{the rest of his}} speech was a lamentable account of the time and trouble he would have to spend upon his constituents if the new method came in. He was the perfect figure of the parochially important person in a state of defensive excitement. No doubt his speech appealed to many in the House.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, my dear fellow," [...] {{he said to}} each, [...] "I am {{at present}} waiting with extreme anxiety for news of a most {{important}} nature, and until I get it I am so restless and so confoundedly irritable that I am not fit to associate with anyone. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> here again I {{hope that it will}} be all right, and then I shall be delighted to come to you, and have a chat over our Indian days; but at present I really am not up to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! indeed. That thief of a clergyman, who got {{his finger}} into the pie of dead Mademoiselle, eh? Well, {{there are no more}} {{pickings}} here, Pasteur, but perhaps you come to have your fortune told. Shall <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the crystal for you and tell you nice things about--what shall we say? About the past of that handsome Madame of yours, for instance? Oh! I will do it for love, yes, for love. Or shall I make that mummy speak for you? I can, for once I lived in that body of hers--it was a gay life," [...] and she stopped, gasping.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> astonishment {{towards the}} old man, but he was, or feigned to be, busied in the {{arrangement}} of his dress. From him <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> back to the slight gentle figure of the child. Alone! In that gloomy place all the long, dreary night.|$|R
5000|$|Miss Storie {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I {{identified}} the guilty man. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> his eyes and he <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> mine. <b>I</b> knew who he was and he knew that I recognised him. I had found the guilty person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O were ye at Brackley? An' what saw ye there? Was {{his young}} widow weeping An' tearing her hair?" [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at Brackley, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> and oh! There was mirth, there was feasting, But naething o' woe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meg" [...] on {{the first}} lid, smooth and fair. [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> with loving eyes, [...] For folded here, with {{well-known}} care, [...] A goodly gathering lies, [...] The record of a peaceful life-- [...] Gifts to gentle child and girl, [...] A bridal gown, lines to a wife, [...] A tiny shoe, a baby curl. [...] No toys in this first chest remain, [...] For all are carried away, [...] In their old age, to join again [...] In another small Meg's play. [...] Ah, happy mother! Well I know [...] You hear, like a sweet refrain, [...] Lullabies ever soft and low [...] In the falling summer rain.|$|E
6000|$|I {{found her}} {{standing}} before the glass, having just completed her preparations for appearing on the stage. Dressed in her picturesque costume, she was so charming that I expressed my admiration heartily, as became her old friend. [...] "Do you really like me?" [...] she said, with the innocent familiarity which I recollected so well. [...] "See how <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the glass--that is the great test." [...] It {{was not easy to}} apply the test. Instead of looking at her image in the glass, it was far more agreeable to look at herself. We were interrupted--too soon interrupted--by the call-boy. He knocked at the door, and announced that the overture had begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's the inconsistency? I {{do it in}} {{the broad}} light of day, {{whatever}} I do: that's virtually what I meant. If I look at the spectacle of the world <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> preference at what's charming in it. Sometimes I've to go far to find it--very likely; but that's just what I do. I go far--as far as my means permit me. Last year I heard of such a delightful little spot; a place where a wild fig-tree grows in the south wall, the outer side, of an old Spanish city. I was told it was a deliciously brown corner--the sun making it warm in winter. As soon as I could I went there." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{figure of}} a man appeared, {{advancing}} toward me along the thin brown path. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{his face as he}} came nearer. It showed me dimly the face of my husband's brother--John Zant.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're wrong," [...] he said curtly. [...] "You can {{get them}} at any big dealer's. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at a western store where they stock those machines, yesterday, and the fellow gave me his schedule." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{inferred}} that on such gala occasions carriages {{were given}} an extra cleaning. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{up and down the}} street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> my memorandum book for the address of Azalea Adair.|$|R
