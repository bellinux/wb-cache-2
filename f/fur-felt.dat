50|$|The uniform {{consists}} of an Olive Drab side cap or <b>fur-felt</b> M1911 Campaign hat, an olive-drab wool spread-collared shirt worn with a black worsted wool tie, Olive Drab wool trousers, and russet-brown leather Type II (rubber-soled) service shoes.|$|E
5000|$|Certain Pre-War {{items were}} {{discontinued}} due to economy measures. The expensive and labor-intensive <b>fur-felt</b> Campaign hat {{was replaced with}} either the folding cloth [...] "Overseas Cap" [...] for wear in the field or the Peaked cap for dress or formal duty wear. The wool (Class B) or cotton (Class C) service shirts were only made with epaulets for officers {{in order to save}} material.|$|E
5000|$|The Boss was {{designed}} {{with a high}} crown to provide insulation {{on the top of}} the head, and a wide stiff brim to provide shelter from both sun and precipitation for the face, neck and shoulders. The original <b>fur-felt</b> hat was waterproof and shed rain. Overall, the hat was durable and lightweight. On the underside, the hat included a sweatband, a lining to protect the hat, and, as a memorial to earlier designs, a bow on its sweatband, which had the practical purpose of helping distinguish the front from the back. The original designs were natural in color with four-inch crowns and brims; a plain strap was used for the band.|$|E
5000|$|Stetson {{was born}} in New Jersey, the 7th of 12 children. His father, Stephen Stetson, was a hatter. As a youth, John Stetson worked with his father until John was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and his doctor predicted he had {{only a short time}} to live. Given this dire prognosis, he left the hat-making business to explore the American West, afraid this would be his only chance to see it. [...] There he met drovers, bullwhackers and cowboys. [...] The former hat-maker turned a critical eye to the flea-infested coonskin caps favored by many of the gold seekers, and wondered whether <b>fur-felt</b> would work for a lightweight, all-weather hat suitable for the West.|$|E
