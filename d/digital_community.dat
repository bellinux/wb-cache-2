40|$|Abstract. Recent {{years have}} seen an {{explosion}} in the number and scale of <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> (e. g. peer-to-peer file sharing systems, chat applications and social networking sites). Unfortunately, <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> are host to sig-nificant criminal activity including copyright infringement, identity theft and child sexual abuse. Combating this growing level of crime is problematic due to the ever increasing scale of today’s <b>digital</b> <b>communities.</b> This paper presents an approach to provide automated support for the detection of child sexual abuse related activities in <b>digital</b> <b>communities.</b> Specifically, we analyze the character-istics of child sexual abuse media distribution in P 2 P file sharing networks and carry out an exploratory study to show that corpus-based natural language analysis may be used to automate the detection of this activity. We then give an overview of how this approach can be extended to police chat and social net-working communities...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding and describing the nature of 'community' within digital domains. A literature review indicates multiple media use within communities. The increasing range of personal and organisational technologies available suggests <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> {{are more than just}} online communities. As such they require a new method of assessment. The design of <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> should be based on an understanding of 'community' in digital domains. Previous assessments, often focusing exclusively on the Internet, failed to recognise the ways in which technologies are integrated within communities. A new assessment method should allow the examination of integrated technology effects on communities through an analysis of important community features. To assess <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> a framework consisting of five headings was developed. The framework allows the effects of technologies to be examined across a range of communities. Taking a convergent methodologies approach five studies were undertaken covering a range of technologies and media integration issues. The results suggest that <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> are groups of people using technology to support their social interaction needs. Media use within <b>digital</b> <b>communities</b> is heavily integrated and the social needs of community members drive technology use. Designers should provide communities with flexible technology that permits integration and member adaptation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

It reports on an investigation into teens experiences in the United States, as they use information to learn how to create content and participate within the context of social media. Teens that participate in sharing art on sites such as DeiviantArt, website creation, blogging, and/or posting edited videos via YouTube and Vimeo, were interviewed. The interviews explored teens' information experiences within particular social and digital contexts. Teens discussed the information they used, how information was gathered and accessed, and explored the process of using that information to participate in the communities...|$|R
