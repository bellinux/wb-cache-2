5|$|Polka Party! was {{released}} October 21, 1986. After it {{was released}}, the album peaked at number 177 on the Billboard 200. Compared to Yankovic's previous albums—Dare to Be Stupid peaked at number 50 and In 3-D peaked at number 17—Polka Party! {{was a major}} commercial disappointment for the comedian. The album was the lowest-charting studio album released by Yankovic and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The others include the soundtrack to his film UHF (1989) and Poodle Hat (2003).|$|E

5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{a tragedy}} written by William Shakespeare {{early in his career}} about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths {{ultimately}} reconcile their feuding families.

Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a {{repertoire}} of four pitches. He throws a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95mph; this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> main pitches. He also has a slider, a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.|$|E
5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E

5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} project, 127 Hours, {{directed}} by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It {{was given a}} limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would read books such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a {{once in a lifetime}} experience. To date, 127 Hours <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7million against an $18million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E
5|$|Kamohoali'i is {{the best}} known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of Pele, and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii.

At one point he had a heiau (temple or shrine) {{dedicated}} to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean {{on the island of}} Molokai. Kamohoali'i was an ancestral god, not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself. In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most famous works {{and the one that}} launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E
5|$|One of Pliny's {{authorities}} is Marcus Terentius Varro. In {{the geographical}} books, Varro is supplemented by the topographical commentaries of Agrippa, which were {{completed by the}} emperor Augustus; for his zoology, he relies largely on Aristotle and on Juba, the scholarly Mauretanian king, studiorum claritate memorabilior quam regno (v. 16). Juba <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> principal guides in botany; Theophrastus is also named in his Indices, and Pliny had translated Theophrastus's Greek into Latin. Another work by Theophrastus, On Stones was cited as a source on ores and minerals. Pliny strove to use all the Greek histories available to him, such as Herodotus and Thucydides, {{as well as the}} Bibliotheca Historica of Diodorus Siculus.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of Love <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present {{a challenge to the}} viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E

5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Terra Nova is Nikola ap Io, the squad leader of Strike Force Centauri. His older brother, Brandt ap Io, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subordinates, {{and the two}} share a mutual animosity. Other members of the squad include Sarah Walker, the {{daughter}} of a Centauri Council member; Ernest Schuyler, who is known for his sense of humor; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford. Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with the squad. Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of the squad, and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus. Live-action full-motion video cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> creations {{and that he had}} planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

5|$|Kimlinger of Anime News Network {{said that}} while Naruto's initial fight scenes are lacking {{conviction}} when compared to others, his encounter with Gaara <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> best moments because its tactics surpassed most shōnen stereotypes. ANN's Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich made similar comments. The character's final fight against Sasuke {{at the end of}} Part I attracted similar responses, due to the fighting styles employed, and the character development resulting from their rivalry. The enormous physical changes caused by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics, as Naruto's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than other series' antagonists. Carlo Santos of ANN commented on the character's growth in Part II, specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto's comments on peace, and the means by which it is achieved, touch on philosophical themes never seen in a shōnen series. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto's attitude as he acts calmly and more seriously than in previous story arcs. Naruto's new Senjutsu style was praised, as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain, which resulted in a detailed display of his skills. Allega Frank from Polygon noted that during the start of both the manga and anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is facing an enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried. Singer Diana Garnet expressed her pleasure at recording one of the ending theme songs for the animated series of Naruto Shippuden stating that not only she has been a fan of the series ever since she was younger, but was also motivated by Naruto's character because of his determination not to give up no matter what challenge he faced.|$|E
5|$|The plays {{were written}} across thirty-six years of Sophocles' career {{and were not}} {{composed}} in chronological order, but instead were written in the order Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Oedipus at Colonus. Nor were they composed as a trilogy – a group of plays to be performed together, but are the remaining parts of three different groups of plays. As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, Creon is the undisputed king {{at the end of}} Oedipus Rex and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes. Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus' daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of Oedipus Rex. By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus' sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession. In Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: Ismene explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon. Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed. In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in Oedipus at Colonus, Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l. 429, Theodoridis, tr.) to their father's going to exile, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bitterest charges against them.|$|E
