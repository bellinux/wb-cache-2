5|$|Jenna {{mentions}} that she met Jayden 20 years ago. The scene then flashes back to Jenna getting dissed {{by a young}} Jayden. The costume she is wearing <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> costume that Jane Krakowski wore 20 years previously in the Broadway musical Starlight Express. In addition, Jayden is dressed similar to the street urchin Gavroche in Les Misérables because the young boy playing that role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight.|$|E
5|$|The {{rule for}} the {{automaton}} {{within each of}} these subsets is equivalent (except for a shift by half a cell per time step) to another elementary cellular automaton, Rule 102, in which the new state of each cell is the exclusive or of its old state and its right neighbor. That is, the behavior of Rule 90 <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the behavior of two interleaved copies of Rule 102.|$|E
5|$|This {{article is}} about signal {{reflections}} on electrically conducting lines. Such lines are loosely {{referred to as}} copper lines, and indeed, in telecommunications are generally made from copper, but other metals are used, notably aluminium in power lines. Although this article is limited to describing reflections on conducting lines, this <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> phenomenon as optical reflections in fibre-optic lines and microwave reflections in waveguides.|$|E

5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as {{that used}} in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified {{to produce a}} higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes {{it much easier to}} strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya {{is the cause}} of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya {{is the cause of}} illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya. Maya <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued {{that he was not}} aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E

30|$|During experimentation, it {{was noted}} that the results of the two {{ensemble}} SVR models <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>The</b> ranks of the base models using RMSE and E a for ranking may not be <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but <b>the</b> ordering of the samples is almost always <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> In other words, the results of both Ensemble_SVR_APRE and Ensemble_SVR_RMSE <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Hence, results of only Ensemble_SVR_APRE model are used and reported. Henceforth, the model will simply also be referred to as ensemble SVR or ensemble SVM.|$|R

As such, Borer acts done with such a device, such as the netting of a tea bag, would be classed as an act of Merakaid (Sieving/Straining).|$|E
