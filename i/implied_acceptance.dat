5000|$|Although the Basic Law, in its {{original}} form, maintained the continuing existence of a larger Germany, 'Germany as a whole'; nevertheless, the extent of this wider German national territory is nowhere defined in the Basic Law, although it was always clearly understood that both East Germany and Berlin were included. In its judgement of 1973, confirming the constitutional validity of the Basic Treaty between East Germany and West Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court justified the recognition of East Germany as a valid German state, {{on the basis that}} this would enable the GDR in the future to declare accession to the Basic Law under Article 23. But the Court then explicitly acknowledged that this limited de jure recognition of the GDR also <b>implied</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the constitutional power of the GDR in the interim to enter into international treaties, naming in particular the treaty with Poland which confirmed the transfer of the 'Eastern Territories' to Polish sovereignty. [...] The Communist regime in East Germany fell in 1990. Following free elections the parliament of the GDR (East Germany) declared the accession of the GDR according to Article 23 to the Federal Republic of Germany to come into effect on 3 October 1990, making unification an act unilaterally initiated by the last East German parliament. East Germany's 'declaration of accession' (Beitrittserklärung) envisaged the East German territories being included into the field of application of the Basic Law; but subject to the Basic Law being first being amended in accordance with both the previously negotiated Unification Treaty between East and West Germany, and also the Two-Plus-Four Treaty, under which the Allied Powers had relinquished their residual German sovereignty. So, prior to the date of accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic of Germany Article 23 was repealed, representing an explicit commitment under Two-Plus-Four Treaty that, following the unification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin, no [...] "other parts of Germany" [...] remained in east or west to which the Berlin Republic might validly be extended. Rather than adopting a new constitution under Article 146 of the Basic Law, the Bundestag (Parliament of Germany) amended Article 146 and the Preamble of the Basic Law to state that German unification had now been fully achieved; while also adding a further clause 143(3) to entrench in the Basic Law the irreversibility of acts of expropriation undertaken by the Soviet occupying powers between 1945 and 1949. Hence when the GDR's nominal accession to the Federal Republic under Article 23 came into effect on 3 October 1990, Article 23 was no longer in place. Strictly therefore, German reunification was effected by the Unification Treaty between two sovereign states, the GDR and the Federal Republic, and not by Article 23; although the former Article 23 was agreed by both parties to the Treaty as setting the constitutional model by which unification would be achieved.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of the complex problem of narrative voice in three novels of E. M. Forster. Much of the recent critical commentary on Forster's narrative voice either discusses narrative voice as an extension of character, or discusses narrative voice as a biographical and psychological extension of Forster. Despite these approaches to Forster's narrative voice, Forster's narrative voice continues to "irritate" us, as it did Lionel Trilling in 1944, in its "refusal to be great. " I examine Forster's narrative voice as an autonomous element disconnected from the trappings of characterological, biographical and psychological criticism. I discuss how the narrative voice develops a moral and philosophical view that begins with a pessimism about the possibility of human relationships in Where Angels Fear To Tread, continues with a fantasy of perfectly unified relationships in A Room With A View, and culminates in A Passage To India in which the narrative voice promises unity and continuance through an <b>implied</b> <b>acceptance</b> of metaphysical and metaphorical assumptions. The protagonists in the three novels that I discuss all have an experience which they cannot define in words. The characters' inability to define experience parallels the narrative voice's detachment from the reader, and it also foreshadows the narrative voice's ultimate refusal to provide a definition, or an interpretation of itself. The characters' inability to define experience makes them appear to be characters who are limited, or "flat" stereotypes; and in all three cases, the protagonist requires another figure to act as an intermediary between it and the totalizing experience of "the other. " This intermediary figure provides character with a circumlocutory interpretation of experience; and it therefore evokes the characters' simultaneous desire and inability to describe the subject of its experience. This circumlocutory figure becomes a figure that exposes and exists within the implied space between character and narrative voice, and the narrative voice and the reader. When the narrative voice describes a character's use of a circumlocutory figure, it points to both the character's, and its own elision...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{explore the}} causes of the Great Awakening that swept the middle colonies during the 1730 s, 1740 s, and 1750 s. Focusing upon the Awakening as a religious movement, I postulate that its primary characteristic was ritualistic revivalism that existed apart from ideological and social structures. I seek the cultural origins of this revivalism among those most affected by the Awakening in the middle colonies, the Scottish and Irish protestants, primarily Presbyterians. Therefore, the research scope spans three geographic areas, Northern Ireland, the Scottish Lowlands, and the middle colonies, over 135 years. I have used church records, sermons, polemical pamphlets, personal papers, and government records to piece together the religious experience of the Scots-Irish. ^ During the 1620 s Ulster experienced a great revival that quickly spread to western Scotland, beginning a 2 ̆ 2 Scots-Irish 2 ̆ 2 revivalism tradition. While the official church in both countries during this century was forced frequently to conform itself to the prelatic, sectarian, or Presbyterian structure, according to the persuasions in power, the people of those two areas remained loyal to a religious tradition traceable back to the 1560 Scottish Reformation, a religion that included Calvinism, rigid moral discipline, and revivalism. ^ Economic exigencies led many Irish protestants to migrate to the colonies during the eighteenth century. In both old and new settlements cultural upheaval threatened, and people fought for their traditions. In Ireland this was symbolized by the battle over subscription to the Westminster Confession, where subscription equalled orthodoxy, which <b>implied</b> <b>acceptance</b> of revivalist rituals. In Scotland, many adhered to the Secessionists, schismatics seeking a return to the days of Knox; others enjoyed and prospered from Whitefield 2 ̆ 7 s tour. Both were responding to the ascendance of the moderate, nonevangelical party in the Scottish church. In the middle colonies the clergy were exposed to a Puritan Calvinism by the New England clerics already resident among them. This theology provided a justification from revivalism that the Irish and Scottish clergy did not have. Together a demanding and enthusiastic people and a gifted clergy could produce a movement of the size and scope of the Great Awakening. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Presentation date: 1973 - 06 - 20 Conflict and {{competition}} between outdoor recreational activities is increasing in intensity. Thus, management agencies and persons responsible for regulation of outdoor recreation areas {{have become increasingly}} concerned and are seeking appropriate means for amelioration of the intensifying problem. This research was designed to seek better understanding of conflicts and incompatabilities as perceived by recreationists. The research utilized a questionnaire to develop a body of original data on participants' perception of compatibility or non-compatibility of outdoor recreational activities and their attitudes toward degree and kinds of existing and needed resource development. As the case study area for this investigation, the sand dunes coastal environment of Central Oregon was selected. Topics in the questionnaire covered perception of recreational development, attitudes toward recreational land and facility ownership, perception of pollution conditions and perception of and attitudes toward recreational activities in terms of conflict or harmony {{with each other and}} with the natural environment. Analysis of the 428 questionnaires completed revealed some surprising responses. Perhaps the single most important finding from the user survey was that the majority of the respondents viewed the coastal zone as underdeveloped. Additional development was desired, and the kinds preferred reflected the type of accommodation and recreational facilities that respondents were already using. Tent and trailer parks, picnic grounds and low-cost motels were the preferred kinds of developments based on responses to the questionnaire. The list of recreational activities reported as being enjoyed in this coastal zone was long and varied; however, the greatest number of preferred activities were environmentally-oriented and definitely related to the marine and sand dune environments. Motorbiking in particular, dune buggying, tavern or lounge visiting and nightclubbing, hunting and waterskiing were often mentioned as bothersome, annoying activities. Most respondents <b>implied</b> <b>acceptance</b> of regulation of user activities and zoning for land use. It was the consensus among respondents that motor vehicles should be restricted to prescribed areas of the sand dunes and beach. Different accommodational uses of campgrounds was not generally desired as long as vegetation buffers were used to separate sites. When perception of air, water or noise pollution was questioned and a combined pollution index developed, respondents indicated pollution to be only slight and lumbering and associated industries were reported as the major causes. Human factors, pollution and the weather were the most frequently mentioned unappealing features of this coastal zone. Throughout the littoral the numbers of people at recreation sites were reported as just about right. Increased recreational use and development appears to be inevitable and in some cases perhaps even desirable within this coastal zone. Consequently, viable management techniques need to be developed so as to minimize activity conflicts and to maintain natural environment harmony in the area...|$|E
