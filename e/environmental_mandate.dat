40|$|In {{spite of}} early {{hopes for a}} "fading out" of {{sovereignty}} {{in the face of}} global environmental challenges, recent codifications of international law have confirmed the creeping national enclosure of what were once considered common assets-e. g., exclusive economic zones under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, or access to genetic resources from the 1983 International Undertaking via the 1992 Biodiversity Convention to the 2001 Plant Gene Treaty. Yet, because of their explicit limitation and qualification by "common interest" obligations, these expanded sovereign rights of nation states must be considered fiduciary rather than proprietary. Hence, the emerging legal regime is one of international public trusteeship (sometimes referred to as guardianship or stewardship) over a widening range of environmental resources. The article traces the evolution of the trusteeship concept in modern environmental law and its ramifications for international law and governance, as reflected in current proposals suggesting a new <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> for the UN Trusteeship Council.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a synthesis of}} seven separate reports into key aspects of tourism in Rotorua, and makes recommendations for the future management of the sector. The overall conclusion {{of this study is}} that tourism in Rotorua appears to be at an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable level at present. While future growth seems assured in the short-term there are a number of challenges in maintaining the long-term sustainability of the sector, and its role in regional social and economic development. The key areas of risk are those associated with the broader institutional, environmental and social elements of tourism management. The main thrust of the results from this research programme is that tourism planning needs to focus at a broad level. However, this report also has specific implications for the marketing of tourism some of which are noted here.

40|$|California {{passed its}} {{landmark}} climate change legislation, Assembly Bill (AB) 32, in 2006, ushering {{in a new}} era in state policymaking. Faced with a challenging new <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, state policymakers grappled with how to comply. One result was the passage of another piece of landmark legislation in the state – Senate Bill (SB) 375 – in 2008. SB 375 aims to achieve greenhouse gas reductions from land use and transportation through better coordination of local and regional development plans. The law requires that regions (through regional planning organizations, in cooperation with local governments) develop “Sustainable Communities Strategies” to achieve more efficient land use and transportation by aligning some planning processes that traditionally had been disconnected. However, SB 375 does not require that local governments comply with the Sustainable Communities Strategies nor does it redirect or create new funding sources to support sustainable planning practices or projects. This report identifies state and regional policies and programs that could support the objectives of SB 375. The Center for a Sustainable California (CSC) research team first evaluated the policy context surrounding SB 375. Secondly, the team identified policies (proposed and existing) from California and elsewhere that contribute to accomplishing climate policy goals by linking land use and transportation. In addition, the team interviewed a number of stakeholders, representing various organizational perspectives, to ask for their views on a range of potential state and regional policy actions aimed at strengthening SB 375 implementation. Finally, the team developed this report, to present cumulative research findings on policy challenges that threaten to undermine effective SB 375 implementation and to recommend a set of priority actions to address these challenges...|$|E

Such in-depth scrutiny has rarely emerged in the East African context, with few studies providing {{an analysis of the}} entire policy process and the actor network involved. This study offers a thick, descriptive narrative of the environmental policy arena in Nairobi, where rampant environmental degradation due to unconstrained development is occurring despite the existence of an environmental regulatory framework. The effects of newly implemented constitutional and strategic development reforms in this rapidly evolving African metropolis are also interrogated. The study lens shifts from the macro-level perspective of the policy system and context, to the micro-level of the institutional and individual actors, examining their roles, authority, and the interconnections between them. A qualitative case study approach is utilized, consisting of 25 semi-structured interviews conducted with environmental policymaking leaders in Nairobi. Both deductive (themes are applied to the data) and inductive (themes are derived from the data) analyses are applied to examine the research data in detail. The primary data is supplemented with numerous secondary sources, which provide a practical grounding for the primary analysis. The narrative that coalesces around the data themes uncovers the underlying causes for poor environmental regulation thus far, prominent among them being a lack of institutional capacity in state agencies; corrupt and nepotistic governance; and the splintering of the <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> among numerous state institutions, leading to competition and conflict among them. Adam and Kriesi’s Network Approach (2007) is then critically adapted and applied, revealing the concentration of power in state authorities and disproportionate distribution of influence among non-state actors in the environmental policy subsystem. This policy network analysis shows how these conditions create the potential for low to moderate incremental policy change going forward. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|The deep oceans house astonishingly {{high levels}} of {{biodiversity}} and are critical to the Earths ecological health and human well-being. Venturing into this extraordinary environment, human exploration for raw materials has reached new depths with mineral deposits being explored on the deep ocean floor, up to 6000 meters below the surface. Commercial-scale mining of seabed minerals is likely to start {{in the near future}} and presents a range of uncertainties as well as risks of significant environmental harm. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has exclusive competence over minerals on the international seabed. It is critically important that the ISA applies a precautionary approach to deep seabed mining to ensure environmental harm will not exceed an acceptable level once mining commences. This thesis examines the <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> of the ISA and the implementation of the precautionary principle by the ISA in its regulation and management of deep seabed mining. In doing so, the analysis is not limited to an examination of the inclusion, or otherwise, of the precautionary principle into the legal framework of the ISA. Rather, this thesis examines the actual implementation of the principle in practice through the work of the ISA. In particular, this thesis examines the ISAs ongoing work on the development of a system of environmental protection standards and measures as well as procedural safeguards and decision-making processes that facilitate risk assessment and risk management. Synthesising the literature on the meaning and implementation of the precautionary principle, this thesis develops a set of steps, identified as an implementation cycle, by which the precautionary principle can be operationalised. This implementation cycle is then used as the framework against which the ISAs risk assessment and risk management measures are analysed and evaluated. This thesis identifies strengths in the manner and extent to which the ISA is implementing the precautionary principle. However, it also reveals significant weaknesses and lacunae in the existing regulatory framework of the ISA. This thesis identifies a range of protective measures as well as procedural and institutional arrangements that may be adopted to ensure the precautionary management of deep seabed mining by the ISA...|$|E

40|$|The transboundary {{character}} of many natural resources, the continuous {{changes in the}} environment, together with the constant evolution of scientific findings are among the elements that deeply influence international environmental law. While traditionally the development of international environmental law is associated with Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), which since the Nineties have greatly contributed to shape the fundamental principles of this field, nowadays a more complex picture should be designed, which includes treaties and institutions pertaining to other legal areas of international law {{that are relevant to}} environmental matters. Contemporary environmental matters indeed are increasingly linked with economic development and human rights issues. These linkages {{are at the heart of}} the notion of sustainable development. In this polyhedric dimension, multiple branches of international law are directly and indirectly relevant to address the complexities of today’s most pressing environmental and sustainable development challenges. As for the economic-related fields, trade in environmental goods and services is one of the “bones of contention” under WTO negotiations, while vice versa under the climate regime, competitiveness is the underlying reason behind the impasse in the design of a new climate treaty. Moreover, bilateral and multilateral investment treaties increasingly recognize the relevance of environmental protection within their scope. As for the human right dimension, while environment-related cases are increasingly brought to human rights bodies, the independent expert of the UN Human Rights Council is currently studying “human rights obligations related to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. ” In such a context, the term “law” encompasses a wide range of normative instruments, which include treaty provisions and decisions adopted by MEAs treaty bodies, judgments and awards by judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, and their influence on the formation of customary environmental principles. In parallel, “lawmaking” describes the procedures through which these norms are created. Often these original and creative regulatory tools and processes do not meet the requirements and the definitions of traditional public international law, and have raised criticisms with regard to their legitimacy and effectiveness. In this perspective, this chapter focuses firstly on distinctive features of MEAs’ decision-making procedures that go beyond inter-state patterns. Secondly, it highlights how environmental matters are taken into account by other sectors of international law, namely trade and investment regimes and non-state actors’ rules, which – although not having a specific <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> – influence the evolution of international environmental law. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates kaitiakitanga as an {{integral}} component of the Maori environmental management system and the theoretical and practical implications of this concepts incorporation in modern resource management, in particular the conservation and heritage management of the Kaituna River, Okere, Rotorua. With increasing attention being focused {{on the development of}} bicultural policies for resource management, this thesis pursues the effectiveness of New Zealand's <b>environmental</b> <b>mandate</b> as inclusive of Maori and Treaty of Waitangi concerns. Through the use of an extensive literature research and retroductive interviews, this thesis examines both the Maori and Western world-views and their resource management perspectives and practices. In terms of giving expression to kaitiakitanga, an investigation of the hierarchies, priorities and partnerships developed to resolve competing resource conflicts was undertaken, as well as the various legally based structures and mechanisms for processing and implementing partnership arrangements and recognising iwi rights and values. The Kaituna River was chosen as a case study because of the current ongoing resource management conflict between Maori and the Crown with respect to recreational use and commercial development versus Maori cultural and spiritual values. The case study complemented the findings of this research in that, despite the widespread formal recognition of kaitiakitanga by management agencies and the various statutory and non-statutory mechanisms {{that could be used to}} accord Maori management authority, there have been neither a sufficiency, nor an appropriate choice of formally established structures to allow Ngati Pikiao to exercise, as Treaty partners, their kaitiakitanga responsibilities. More specifically, the situation investigated at the Kaituna River established the current inability ofNew Zealand's political and judiciary systems to apply kaitiakitanga effectively as a mechanism for dealing with resource management issues involving Maori and the Crown. At present, kaitiakitanga is expressed in the RMA as a principle to which territorial authorities shall have "particular regard" in achieving the purpose of the Act It is to be effected through the requirement the RMA places on these authorities to "take into account" the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The problem is though, as many Maori involved in resource management are realising, it is a requirement which those with responsibilities under the RMA may choose to readily avoid. Whether the kaitiakitanga role of hapu and iwi will become better understood, appreciated and given effect to by resource management agencies involved and the promised Treaty of Waitangi partnership is being affirmed still remains to be seen. While the case study was specific to the Kaituna River, the findings of this thesis could be relevant to any conflicting resource management situation between Maori and the Crown in New Zealand. The development of new principles and/or a new planning framework relating to the kawanatanga response needs to become consistent with New Zealand's dual mainstream planning heritage. Legal and constitutional adjustments may be needed to facilitate formal collaborative management structures and negotiated agreements at all levels...|$|E

40|$|In a time {{of global}} {{environmental}} instability, public-sector organisations that manage and protect natural resources, which are needed for human wellbeing, play an increasingly important role. These organisations frequently have to weigh up {{the costs and benefits}} of managing natural resources and their services for the public good. Management of social-ecological systems is commonly characterised by uncertainty, disagreement and trade-offs. In South Africa, these challenges are compounded by the fact that mandated organisations are often inadequately resourced in terms of finances, skilled staff and infrastructure. In order to maintain the resilience and robustness of social-ecological systems, public-sector organisations need to cultivate a set of dynamic capabilities, with strong emphasis on learning from their experiences and adapting their management strategies, to innovate and improve their performances. Absorptive capacity (AC) has been described as the ability of an organisation to recognise the value of new external information, acquire it and assimilate it within the organisation, transforming it by applying it with existing knowledge and exploiting the new knowledge for benefit. Organisations with good AC are able to recognise rapidly changing environments and address them by renewing and building on their levels of skill, knowledge and capability to deal with change. This construct has been extensively researched in industries related to business and technology, where its development has been found to stimulate innovative capabilities. There has, however, been little research into its relevance for public-sector organisations or organisations with <b>environmental</b> <b>mandates.</b> This study used methodological triangulation to assess the perceptions of employees on the current state of AC in three public-sector organisations with <b>environmental</b> <b>mandates.</b> This was done to gain insight into their capacity to absorb information and apply their new knowledge in decision-making, in a manner that navigates through environmental change. The key findings of this research suggest that knowledge transformation and exploitation are enhanced by in-house research capabilities and cross-functional interface between internal departments. These findings also suggest that the acquisition of knowledge is not only determined by the in-house research capacity but also depends on the resources available to these departments in terms of time, finances and skilled staff. There was minimal evidence of knowledge exploitation; however, obstacles that were highlighted as hindering this process included individual responsibility and motivation, as well as general organisation capacities, such as communication hierarchies, funding, time and organisational silos. This research found that the well-studied concept of AC can be used as an institutional mechanism to assess and promote adaptive capacity in public-sector organisations with <b>environmental</b> <b>mandates</b> to navigate and innovate through the Anthropocene...|$|R
