40|$|A {{conventional}} {{hammer mill}} is a device {{consisting of a}} rotating head with free- swinging hammers, which reduce rock, grains or similarly hard objects to a predetermined size through a perforated screen, hammer mills {{can be used for}} grinding grain into fine flour or into coarse meal for animal feed production. This project is focused on the design, development, and testing of a hammer mill that has a small scale production capability. The conceptual design was based on the principle of design by analysis. The methodology adopted was to examine the most critical defects of conventional hammer mills and provide solutions. The major components of the new hammer mill are <b>Inlet</b> <b>tray,</b> Throat, Magnetic chamber, Rotor, Crushing chamber...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the computational results from simulations performed on a small-scale cabinet-type forced convective dryer for food product drying. The forced convective dryer is {{designed in the}} form of a drying cabinet, with four trays positioned diagonally to each other within the drying chamber. The trays are designed and simulated as meshed trays to allow better observation of the air-flow and moisture content transport path within the dryer during operation. Air-flow is provided by eight heated-air inlets with four on each of two sides, with two inlets providing heat for each <b>tray.</b> <b>Inlet</b> temperature is kept within the range of food product drying temperature. Boundary conditions of the dryer are also set to simulate the actual dryer such as wall-material and initial conditions. Computational simulations performed on the forced-convective dryer show the air-flow path within the drying chamber in contour plots. Iso-plots of the air-flow magnitude are also shown to illustrate the heated air-flow from the inlets through to the outlet. These plots illustrate the path for moisture content removal from the food product to the outlet. The contour plots also show areas where possible improvement can be implemented. The improvement can also involve alternative boundary conditions, trays positioning and heated-air inlets placement. With the implementation of these improvements a more optimized dryer can be achieved...|$|R
