5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's <b>hawk.</b> <b>Birds</b> that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|R

50|$|Of the {{one hundred}} and twenty-seven bird species found along the Merced River, only 35 occur along {{the entire length of}} the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. However, despite the more extensive modifications to the lower part of the river, there are more species of birds found in the lower watershed, due to the slow-flowing nature of the river that forms marshes and riparian zones. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's <b>hawk.</b> <b>Birds</b> that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and rarely, bald eagle. Of the 140 insect and invertebrate species, which include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, there are also three major exotic species: Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the most}} common animals seen in the Sandia Wilderness are mule deer, black bears, raccoons, bobcats, and various species of squirrel.

50|$|The {{roadside}} hawk's diet consists {{mainly of}} insects, squamates, and small mammals, such as young common marmosets and similar small monkeys which are hunted quite often. It will also take small birds, but far {{less often than}} generalists such as the related but larger white-tailed <b>hawk,</b> or <b>bird</b> specialists like the more distantly related aplomado falcon. Mixed-species feeding flocks it encounters when hunting in open cerrado habitat are not particularly wary of it: they watch it lest the hawk come too close, but consider them hardly more of a threat than the diminutive American kestrel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} the archaeozoological evidence for hawking in Medieval England between AD 600 and 1600. It will initially survey {{the incidence of}} skeletal re-mains of those species closely associated with hawking during the medieval period, namely the short winged hawks, the Goshawk and Sparrowhawk, and the long winged hawks, such as the Peregrine Falcon, Kestrel and Gyrfalcon. By using criteria such as {{the nature of the}} deposition of the skeletal remains, environmental factors and by assessing the incidence of other wild species within the faunal assemblage, this paper demonstrates that in most cases a determination of wild or captive status is possible. These findings pro-vide evidence for the widespread use of <b>hawking</b> <b>birds,</b> especially the Sparrowhawk and the Goshawk in medieval England across the whole period under consideration. Further-more, the distribution of archaeozoological evidence is also indicative of the status of fal-conry as a pursuit of those with means, with manors and castles representing a third of all sites and in general these deposits contain the remains of a greater number of birds. What is perhaps more surprising is the high numbers of trained birds recovered from urban con-texts, although {{it should be noted that}} a number of the urban deposits, such as the Bedern, York and those in Southampton, are associated with high status sites...|$|R
50|$|The lemon-bellied flyrobin is an insectivore, hunting {{its prey}} in the foliage or dead {{branches}} {{of trees and}} shrubs and only rarely on the ground.
