5|$|A {{survey in}} 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the background}} of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> guns and manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar to those on the Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E
5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> morale of the defending troops.|$|E

The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time. The assessment prompted a weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge {{was known to be}} affected by rain vibration.|$|E

5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> {{complexity of the}} poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, {{who is trying to}} become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E

5|$|The Franciscan Order had {{a strong}} {{following}} by the 15th century; its Third Order of Saint Francis attracted women and men to local lay confraternities, such as the Confraternity of the Dry Tree in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged. St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages, then popular and most often taken to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem. He was revered for his own pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1219; by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible <b>for</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> holy sites in Jerusalem, particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E

5|$|The V-22's {{development}} {{process has been}} long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases, {{some of which are}} caused by the requirement to fold wing and rotors to fit aboard ships.

By 2008, $27 billion had been spent on the program and another $27.2 billion was required to complete planned production numbers.
