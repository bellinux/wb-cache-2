50|$|Makin Island is {{the eighth}} ship of the Wasp class, but {{features}} noteworthy technological advances. Changes {{from the previous}} LHD design include: gas turbine main propulsion engines, all-electric auxiliaries, an advanced machinery control system, water mist fire protection systems, and the navy’s most advanced command and control and combat systems equipment. The new propulsion system allows the engines to be directly controlled from the throttles on the bridge replacing the traditional <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs</b> on the earlier Wasp-class LHDs.|$|R

5000|$|The first German {{attempts}} to use control cars (German: Steuerwagen) and remote control-equipped steam locomotives were before World War II by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB). The driver's control instructions were transmitted {{from the control}} car to the locomotive by a Chadburn-type machine <b>telegraph</b> (similar to <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs</b> on ships). The order had to be immediately acknowledged and implemented by the automatic firebox controllers. This indirect control was judged as impractical and unsafe, because, although the driver controlled the brake directly, the danger existed that in an emergency the locomotive would continue supplying [...] "push" [...] power {{for some time and}} possibly derail the train.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Daffodil II was {{constructed}} by James Lamont and Co. at Greenock and entered service in 1957. She {{was larger than}} the Dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service. The gross tonnage of Royal Daffodil II was 609. A gross error {{was the size of}} her engines, developing 1,360 bhp a piece she was underpowered and often struggled in strong tides. Aside from the <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs,</b> she also had docking <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs</b> in the wings, the only Mersey ferryboat to ever have them. The ship's second deck was intended for use as a bar and function area, however this did not happen due to cost limitations. Instead the it was simply a draughty space with seating and a semi -closed basic saloon. The Roman II was added to her name because of a Thames estuary cruise ship also called Royal Daffodil which existed from 1939 until 1967 (see MV Royal Daffodil (1939)).|$|R
5000|$|On surface ships, the conning {{tower was}} {{a feature of}} all battleships and armored cruisers from about 1860 to {{the early years of}} World War II. Located at {{the front end of the}} superstructure, the conning tower was a heavily armored cylinder, with tiny slit windows on three sides {{providing}} a reasonable field of view. Designed to shield just enough personnel and devices for navigation during battles, its interior was cramped and basic, with little more than <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs,</b> speaking tubes or telephones, and perhaps a steering wheel. At all other times than during battles, the ship would be navigated from the bridge instead.Conning towers were used by the French on their floating batteries at the Battle of Kinburn.

50|$|The wreck rests about 320 {{feet below}} the surface of Puget Sound, {{directly}} under a major shipping route. The hull lies in two pieces, having broken apart either as it sank or shortly after it hit bottom. In 1994, the two men expressed hopes that they might find the ship's safe, which was believed to contain a valuable diamond necklace. Another potential prize was a suitcase containing gold brought aboard by a stowaway passenger. The search failed to discover the safe, but the salvagers did recover the ship's <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> and various galley equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally {{there are}} two {{stations}} {{on the bridge of}} a sea going ship for controlling the vessel's maneuvers: the Helm, which uses a wheel (or touchscreen equivalent) to send signals to control the position of the rudder or rudders, and the Lee Helm, which traditionally inputs speed commands by operating an <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> that sends engine commands to the engineering personnel below decks. On modern US Navy surface vessels that use gas turbine or diesel propulsion, the lee helm actually directly controls the ship's speed via throttle control (either a manual throttle lever or a touch screen on some ships). The bridge throttle control directly manipulates propeller pitch and/or engine RPMs when the bridge station is in control, or switches to a traditional order telegraph when the bridge station relinquishes control or if the control system fails. The lee helm on vessels with nuclear propulsion (carriers and submarines) and conventional steam propulsion (amphibious assault ships prior to LHD-8) still uses a telegraph system. One possible origin for the Lee Helm designation for the <b>Engine</b> <b>Order</b> <b>Telegraph</b> is that large sailing ships had a helmsman at the wheel, plus an auxiliary helmsman, positioned on the leeward side of the helm - hence the term [...] "Lee Helm" [...] - to assist the helmsman in controlling the wheel while coming about or when the vessel is laboring in high winds or an extreme sea state.|$|E
50|$|The Mountwood and her {{identical}} sister Woodchurch {{originally had}} bright orange funnels {{with a black}} base and black soot buffer. On the main deck, there was a forward, heated shelter and also a main saloon, aft of this was the toilets and machine space. Below was a saloon bar. On the top deck was a large open promenade and a forward shelter beneath the bridge, although this shelter was open beneath the bridge so it was often breezy and cold. They had a main central wheelhouse and two side cabs, and power came from two medium speed Crossley 8-cylinder diesel engines. Upon the bridge deck, in the wheelhouse, one would find the large brass helm, the hydraulic steering telemotor. a binnacle, and two conjoined Chadburn Synchrostep <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraphs.</b> These were linked {{to the other two}} identical telegraphs in the docking cabs so they moved in tandem. There was also whistle controls and lighting controls. In the docking cabs or navigation boxes was another binnacle, a whistle control, telegraphs and also various indicators for engine/speed etc. Originally all ferries had a simple ship to shore communicating radio, but did not have radar or sonar. The wheelhouses of the two ferries differed slightly due to different positioning of rudder angle indicators and engine RPM gauges in the bridge wings. The telegraphs were designed to give the captain direct control of the engines (although they could still be used in the traditional signal / response manner) and as such were marked with commands such as brakeand start. They also had more speed settings ahead and astern. The original engines could reach full speed within 3 seconds once run had been passed.|$|R

50|$|After {{undergoing}} a seven-year refitting, including being stripped {{from top to}} bottom, the bow has been raised to create a shielded ipe wood deck. The yacht houses seven cabins on six floors. Part of the re-fitting included upgrading to a diesel Mitsubishi engine {{that is used to}} drive the original propeller. Although it no longer serves as the engine telegraph, the Bulgarian language <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> is still prominently displayed while the original push button steering controls are still used. La Sultana carries three tender boats, two Lancel boats and an XPro 490. In 2016, La Sultana was included in Refit, a book published by Boat International Media, that highlights yacht refits, rebuilds and restorations.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sailing" [...] on {{a sea of}} {{concrete}} at the Naval Training Center, she assisted with the training of over 50,000 new recruits per year, providing an education in the fundamentals of shipboard drills and procedures, using standard deck and bridge gear like that found on all naval vessels, including lifelines, accommodation ladders, signal halyards, searchlights, the <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> and the helm. However, due to her landlocked status, Recruit lacked an engine or screw, and therefore was affectionately nicknamed the [...] "USS Neversail." [...] (The same nickname, [...] "The Neversail," [...] was also applied to the landlocked [...] "ship" [...] at NTC Bainbridge in Maryland.) Reflecting her dual identity as both a ship and a building, she was also known as Building 430, located on Geary Drive between Evans and Chauncey roads.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{commands}} {{would be}} {{passed from the}} senior officer on the bridge to stations dispersed throughout the ship, where physical control of the ship was exercised, as technology did not exist for the remote control of steering or machinery. Helm orders would be passed to an enclosed wheel house, where the coxswain or helmsman operated the ship's wheel. Engine commands would be relayed to the engineer in the engine room by an <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> that displayed the captain's orders on a dial. The engineer would ensure that the correct combination of steam pressure and engine revolutions were applied. The bridge was often open to the elements, therefore a weatherproof pilot house could be provided, from which a pilot, who was traditionally the ship's navigating officer, could issue commands from shelter.|$|E
5000|$|Athenia {{remained}} afloat {{for more}} than 14 hours, until she finally sank stern first at 10:40 the next morning. Of the 1,418 aboard, 98 passengers and 19 crew members were killed. Many died in the engine room and after stairwell, where the torpedo hit. The British crews were famous for putting the passengers' lives before their own, and were expertly trained to handle such [...] "events"; nonetheless, about 50 people died {{when one of the}} lifeboats was crushed in the propeller of the Knute Nelson. No. 5A lifeboat came alongside the empty tanker and tied up, against advice, astern of No 12 lifeboat. Only 15 ft separated the life boat from the tanker's exposed propeller. Once No. 12 lifeboat was emptied it was cast adrift and began to sink. This fact was reported to the bridge of Knute Nelson. For some reason the ship's <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph</b> was then set to full ahead. 5A lifeboat's mooring line or [...] "warp" [...] parted under the stress, causing the lifeboat to be pulled back into the revolving propeller.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{initially}} powered by twelve [...] Siemens-built Bristol Jupiter radial engines in tandem mountings (i.e. a [...] "push-pull" [...] configuration), with six tractor propellers and six pushers mounted in six strut-mounted nacelles above the wing. The nacelles {{were joined by}} an auxiliary wing whose purpose was to stabilize the mountings. The air-cooled Jupiter engines were prone to overheating and could barely lift the Do X to an altitude of 425 m (1,400 ft). The engines were supervised by a flight engineer, who also controlled the 12 throttles and monitored the 12 sets of engine gauges. The pilot would ask the engineer to adjust the power setting, {{in a manner similar}} to the system used on maritime vessels, i.e. an <b>engine</b> <b>order</b> <b>telegraph.</b> Indeed, many aspects of the aircraft echoed nautical arrangements of the time, including the flight deck, which bore a strong resemblance to bridge of a vessel. After completing 103 flights in 1930, the Do X was refitted with [...] Curtiss V-1570 [...] "Conqueror" [...] water-cooled V-12 Vee engine. Only then was it able to reach the altitude of 500 m (1,650 ft) necessary to cross the Atlantic.|$|E
