50|$|Unlike <b>Ethernet,</b> most <b>traffic</b> in 802.11 is sent {{reliably}} using ACKs and NACKs so {{that radio}} interference doesn't cause unbearably high packet loss.

There are various methods for coping with this, such as choosing to unicast multicast data repeatedly to each client, or requesting ACKs from each client. Some methods require only modification on the access point, and are supported in some enterprise-class devices, while other improvements would require modifications to clients, and therefore have not seen widespread adoption.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{characterize}} the delay profile of an Ethernet cross-traffic network statically loaded {{with one of}} the ITU-T network models and a larger <b>Ethernet</b> inline <b>traffic</b> loaded with uniformly-sized packets, showing how the average time inter-val between consecutive minimum-delayed packets increases with increased network load. We compare three existing skew-estimation algorithms and show that the best performance is achieved by solving a lin-ear programming problem on “de-noised ” delay sam-ples. This skew-estimation method forms the basis of a new sample-mode algorithm for packet delay varia-tion filtering. We use numerical simulations in OPNET to illustrate the performance of the sample-mode filter in the networks. We compare the performance of the proposed PDV filter with those of the existing sample minimum, mean, and maximum filters and observe that the sample-mode filtering algorithm is able to match or outperform other types of filters, at different levels of network load...|$|R

50|$|Ethernet {{exchange}} {{is a physical}} network infrastructure through which Ethernet service providers, carriers and Internet service providers exchange <b>Ethernet</b> <b>traffic</b> between their networks. The Ethernet exchange was created as a neutral meeting place where wireless carriers can connect to multiple Ethernet services in several markets that need access to specific locations though one connection.

Thus, allowing Ethernet sellers connecting to an Ethernet exchange immediate access to the buyers and a more basic technical process.|$|E
