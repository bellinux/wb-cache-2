40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} linear time {{algorithm}} to greedily orient {{the edges of}} a path graph model to obtain a <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph model (when possible). Moreover we extend this algorithm to find an odd sun when the method fails. This algorithm has several interesting consequences concerning the relationship between <b>path</b> graphs and <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs. One is that for a <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph, path graph models and <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph models are the same. Another consequence concerns the difference between <b>path</b> graphs and <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. This {{can be used to}} deduce the forbidden induced subgraph characterization of <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs from the forbidden induced subgraph characterization of path graphs. The last consequence is algorithmic and shows that the recognition of <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs is not more difficult than the recognition of path graphs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{spanning}} tree T of a graph G {{is called a}} treet-spanner, if the distance between any two vertices in T is at most t-times their distance in G. A graph that has a tree t-spanner is called a treet-spanner admissible graph. The problem of deciding whether a graph is tree t-spanner admissible is NP-complete for any fixed t≥ 4, and is linearly solvable for t= 1 and t= 2. The case t= 3 still remains open. A <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph is called a 2 -sep <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph if all of its minimal a−b vertex separator for every pair of non-adjacent vertices a and b are of size two. Le and Le [H. -O. Le, V. B. Le, Optimal tree 3 -spanners in <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs, Networks 34 (2) (1999) 81 – 87] showed that <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs admit tree 3 -spanners. However, this result {{has been shown to}} be incorrect by Panda and Das [B. S. Panda, Anita Das, On tree 3 -spanners in <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs, Networks 50 (3) (2007) 203 – 210]. In fact, this paper observes that even the class of 2 -sep <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs, which is a proper subclass of <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs, need not admit tree 3 -spanners in general. It, then, presents a structural characterization of tree 3 -spanner admissible 2 -sep <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs. Based on this characterization, a linear time recognition algorithm for tree 3 -spanner admissible 2 -sep <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graphs is presented. Finally, a linear time algorithm to construct a tree 3 -spanner of a tree 3 -spanner admissible 2 -sep <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph is proposed...|$|R
5|$|Finding {{themselves}} {{surrounded by}} the Viet Minh, the French at Sop-Nao stood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the main strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Grézy that the Viet Minh had laid ambushes along the most <b>direct</b> <b>path.</b> The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Viet Minh units following them.

5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

5|$|M-33 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919. It {{ran along the}} current routing from Mio north to M-32 east of Atlanta. The highway also ran south of Mio to M-76 east of Roscommon using segments of what are now M-72 and M-144. By 1927, the southern section from Fairview to Roscommon was redesignated {{as a part of}} M-72. M-33 was shifted to run south of Mio to Rose City instead, creating the M-33/M-72 concurrency in the process. An extension was added {{by the end of the}} decade southward to M-55 at Campbell, a former community east of Selkirk in Ogemaw County. An earthen highway extension of M-33 north of Atlanta to US23 at Onaway was opened in 1934. A few years later in 1938, M-55 was realigned to follow a more <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> east of West Branch. At the same time, M-33 was extended south by a few miles to the new roadway south of Campbell and Selkirk. A lengthy northern extension was added to M-33 in 1940 when US23 was moved to a route along the Lake Huron shoreline between Rogers City and Cheboygan. The former route of US23 between the Afton area and Rogers City was redesignated as a discontinuous section of M-68, and M-33 was extended westward from Onaway along that highway to Afton and north to US27 (now M-27) near Cheboygan, creating the M-33/M-68 concurrency in southern Cheboygan and Presque Isle counties. By 1945, M-33 was extended southward again, this time to terminate at M-76 in Alger.|$|E
