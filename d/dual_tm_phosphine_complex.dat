50|$|In {{chemistry}} phosphines are L-type ligands. They {{are used}} as ligands for many metal complexes. Perhaps the most popular phosphine ligand used is triphenylphosphine, a shelf-stable solid that undergoes oxidation in air relatively slowly. Unlike most metal ammine <b>complexes,</b> metal <b>phosphine</b> <b>complexes</b> tend to be lipophilic, displaying good solubility in organic solvents. They also are compatible with metals in multiple oxidation states. Because of these two features, metal <b>phosphine</b> <b>complexes</b> are useful in homogeneous catalysis. Prominent examples of metal <b>phosphine</b> <b>complexes</b> include Wilkinson's catalyst (Rh(PPh3)3Cl), Grubbs' catalyst, and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0).|$|R
