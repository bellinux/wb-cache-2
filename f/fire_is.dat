5|$|The {{commander}} of the UNSC warship Spirit of <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> Captain James Cutter (Gregg Berger), a strong leader who has earned the admiration of his subordinates.

30|$|ENSO values during fire {{years prior}} to 1900 did not depart {{significantly}} from mean ENSO values, although years in which <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> widespread (at least four sites recording <b>fire)</b> <b>were</b> associated with positive ENSO (El Niño) values. Years in which no <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> recorded were associated with negative ENSO (La Niña) values (Figure 5).|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 <b>fire,</b> <b>is</b> restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{made by the}} Chicago Police Department {{and fire}} department. The survivors claimed that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time. Although the actual cause of the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson. It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the <b>fire</b> <b>were</b> never noted.|$|R
50|$|The Frog <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a fatal <b>fire</b> that {{occurred}} during the 2015 California wildfire season that burned 4,863 acre of land in the Modoc National Forest. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> one of many <b>fires</b> that <b>was</b> started on July 30 during a lightning storm.|$|R

5|$|A {{wildfire}} or wildland <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation {{that occurs}} in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> quickly {{brought under}} control, Prescott is {{completely}} cut off. News {{of the events}} in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island. Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned fire-fighting apparatus. Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
50|$|The Santiago <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{located near}} Santiago Canyon in Orange County, California, U.S., {{and one of}} twenty-three California wildfires of October 2007. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> intentionally started.|$|R

5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 15 September 2013, a fire broke out at the vacant former Perth Road {{building}} while it awaited demolition. A few classrooms on the first and middle floor suffered.

The fire brigade, who investigated the <b>fire,</b> <b>were</b> {{of the opinion that}} the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started deliberately, probably by youths.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time that the Red Hill <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}}, another <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> reported on Bruce Ridge next to the Australian Institute of Sport. This <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> also in Nature Park, in Scribbly Gum and Stringybark woodland, and rapidly became a crown <b>fire.</b> It <b>was</b> 5 km upwind of the heart of Canberra and added another large smoke plume to the urban landscape. A youth hostel in Dryandra Street was evacuated. In all 100 hectares of this park was burned.|$|R
50|$|While {{most of the}} <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> {{caused by}} weather {{conditions}} and negligence, some of the <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> caused by arsonists suspected of being nationally motivated Arabs. Two Arab citizens of Israel confessed they delibrately set up fires. At least 35 people were arrested on suspection of setting fires or inciting to do so. More than 15 were citizens of the Palestinian Authority and at least 10 were Arab citizens of Israel. Officials in Israel has stated that the delibrate setting of <b>fires</b> <b>is</b> a form of terrorism.
