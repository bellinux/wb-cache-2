2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{basement}} into [...] practice {{space for a}} band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided {{to drop out of}} high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he told her, and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. [...] "All the shit I put her through," [...] he says, [...] "on top {{of the fact that she}} just lost her husband. I felt like I had to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{approached}} her; {{feeling the}} necessity of reminding <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the room.|$|E
60|$|I assured <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not, {{and would}} as soon talk {{standing}} as sitting.|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. When {{that lady}} calls, tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{expected}} home this evening. Tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> suddenly called out of town. You understand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So Mary <b>is</b> twenty-six! <b>I</b> say, David, she {{is getting}} on. Tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{coming in to}} kiss her when she is fifty-two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take this to Miss Thurwell, and tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> waiting, <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> she will see me," [...] she said quietly.|$|R
60|$|I assured <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so {{comfortable}} {{that some of}} my happiest hours were spent gossiping with my landlady over my supper.|$|E
60|$|I {{admitted}} to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{waiting to see}} Mr Fyne come out. That was all. I {{had nothing to say}} to him.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} {{convince}} <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sincere, but she simply couldn't forget the humiliation that I had put upon her on that other occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! Miss Carew is very kind. Please inform <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> deeply honored, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{feel quite}} {{disturbed}} at {{being unable to}} accept her patronage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no; but I {{shall have}} quite reason enough for writing in telling <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry my little niece led her sister into crooked paths.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens alive!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} to herself. [...] "Now I {{have to find}} Aunt Molly and tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to Europe to-morrow with a perfect stranger!" ...|$|R
6000|$|His wife {{joined us}} at this point. (He {{was waiting for}} her outside a draper's shop when I met him.) He {{explained}} to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to Germany, and she said: ...|$|E
60|$|I turned, {{so as to}} let my face show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> past speaking--I turned, {{and waved}} my hand, and saw her dimly, as in a vision, through the tears that had conquered me at last.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny's good-humoured face cleared up. 'Yes, ma'am, I told <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{quite sure}} that Miss Gillian would not go for to do {{anything}} wrong, {{and that it could}} be easy explained; but people has tongues, you see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Geoffrey's {{white face}} assumed {{an air of}} the deepest distress. [...] "How could you frighten the child so?" [...] he murmured. [...] "Please go and tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you hold}} council with Honor over this--as, {{if you are}} wise, you will--you may tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{learning}} gratitude to her. I would ask her pardon if I could without servility.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} it won't be to-night," [...] said the doctor, as he disappeared. [...] "And {{if you see}} Mary, tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> obliged to go; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will send Janet down to fetch her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She trembled when I {{proposed}} flight; but I assured <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{certain of}} {{the protection of the}} king, and that he would, I was sure, when the marriage was once celebrated, use his influence with her father to obtain his forgiveness.|$|E
60|$|Replying {{in those}} terms, I wrote the address {{for the second}} time. Lady Claudia knew {{perfectly}} well, when I gave it to <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to a respectable house kept {{by a woman who}} had nursed me when I was a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I have {{no better}} fortune," [...] said Alleyne, leading Sir Nigel aside. [...] "I pray you, my dear lord, {{that you will}} give my humble service to the Lady Maude, and say to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever her true servant and most unworthy cavalier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{please tell}} <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> may forget, and take upon me, as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> still {{lady of the}} house. Tell her I do not mean it, and <b>I</b> hope <b>that</b> she will check it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can be changed. It must <b>be</b> changed. Tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not good}} enough. You need not fear her. And {{if you will}} say so, <b>I</b> will never <b>be</b> angry with you for the word. I will bless you for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{have a great}} {{desire to}} paint her {{portrait}} and have reason to think she would allow it and is {{waiting for someone to}} propose this homage to her beauty. ...you might tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man of prodigious talent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would tell}} <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} for my own friends. But I must go now. Papa will complain that I am so long away." [...] Then there was another embrace, and at last Clara found {{her way out of}} the house and was alone again in the park.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{had your}} nerve!" [...] he said awed. [...] "What I should be feeling, if I {{were in your}} place and had to meet your mater after telling <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> engaged to marry a girl she had never seen, I don't know. I'd rather face a wounded tiger!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were lots}} of cross goddesses," [...] I said rather crossly myself; for I saw that, after having trodden my romance in the dust, she was willing I should pick it up again and shake it off, and I wished to show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not to be so}} lightly appeased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, mother," [...] said Dickory, [...] "I shall {{fight for}} her; <b>I</b> shall show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> worthier than he <b>is</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love <b>her</b> better. I shall even strive for <b>her</b> if <b>that</b> mad pirate {{comes back and}} tries to overset everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would. It {{would be best}} to the aunt, and just tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fairly well off. She'll tell Ayala I could make quite a proper {{settlement}} on <b>her.</b> <b>That</b> kind of thing does go a long way with young ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is living}} {{up at the}} garage, sir," [...] Robert answered. [...] "Besides, she is deaf. I'll tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sleeping}} in the house to-night as you are not very well. And forgive me, sir--her ladyship left a message. She hoped you would lunch with her to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|But if {{she felt}} any pique she quickly brushed {{it out of}} sight, for, as I have said before, {{she was a young}} woman who had great command of herself. Of course I said to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very glad to have this chance of seeing her again, and she answered, with a laugh: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will never}} tell, that is certain," [...] said Isaac. [...] "And {{for that reason}} I believe Simon Girty got word to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in the hands of}} Cornplanter. At the last moment when the Indians were lashing me to the stake Girty {{came to me and said}} he must have been too late." ...|$|E
60|$|What was that? It was day; Mrs Bowater was herself softly {{calling me}} beyond my curtains, and her eye peeped in. Always before I {{had been up}} and dressed when she brought in my breakfast. Through a violent {{headache}} I surveyed the stooping face. Something in my appearance convinced <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill, and she insisted on my staying in bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Catherine, {{after a few}} moments' reflection, [...] "I do not--ought I? To say the truth, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{hurt and}} grieved, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot still love <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> well, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{delighted to}} hear {{she has left}} the palace before Cuicuitzca arrives. Bid her on no account to try to stir up the false nobles in my favor. They would only betray her to Montezuma. And {{so long as the}} Spaniards are masters here, it is useless to think of revolt elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you won't {{be drawn}} into the matter. I shall say enough to my aunt to satisfy <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> acting for the best, and shall simply, when I go, leave a note for your mistress, telling <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have gone to work out an idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have had in my mind, {{and that it would}} be no use for her to inquire into the matter until she hears of me again." ...|$|R
