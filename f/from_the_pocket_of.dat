500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Bill Raymond, a convict, sentenced to a long term, {{is on his way}} to prison, in custody of the sheriff. A little girl [...] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent. The nurse fears to mention the incident, and the governor does not know how his darling's life was saved. Later the governor goes to the state prison on a tour of inspection, and Nell accompanies him. She has some flowers which she wants to give to the prisoners. In her tour of the prison, she recognizes Bill. She tells her father about it, and he pardons the hero-convict on the spot...." ...|$|E
2500|$|A diary {{recovered}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> co-pilot Robert Toner {{recorded the}} crew's suffering {{on the walk}} northward. It indicated none {{of the men were}} aware they had been flying over land when they bailed out or were [...] inland. Speculation concludes the empty desert floor in the darkness may have appeared like open sea. The eight surviving crew members walked north because they believed they were fairly close to the Mediterranean coast. As they walked, the group left behind footwear, parachute scraps, Mae West vests and other items as markers to show searchers their path.|$|E

5000|$|The {{record was}} {{described}} by vocalist Bret Michaels as a [...] "glorified demo".

Humbug, Inc. was started with $6,500 pooled together <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> Kurtzman, Arnold Roth, Al Jaffee, Will Elder and Harry Chester.

50|$|The Edmonton Bulletin, the town's only paper, did {{not make}} any {{specific}} endorsements.

50|$|In early 1997, Yang {{took another}} career risk. She {{went to work}} as a public {{relations}} representative and spokesperson for Project Hope, China's main charity organization.

Her conviction grew that her generation needed thoughtful (and entertaining) cultural journalism.|$|R
50|$|Three {{particular}} charges are levelled at the tort system, for having distorting economic effects. First, {{the costs of}} litigation and compensation payouts raise the cost of insurance. Because most tort claims will be paid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> insurance, and because the public generally pays into insurance schemes of all kinds, tort reform proponents assert that reducing tort litigation and payouts will benefit everyone who pays for insurance.|$|R

The players prepare the different boards simultaneously; it does not matter which player prepares which board.|$|R

50|$|Revenue {{and total}} profit of the MLM company is thus largely {{generated}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> participants within <b>the</b> MLM pyramid who are simultaneously both salespersons and consumers at once. Only an insignificantly {{small proportion of}} revenue and total profit is derived from non-participant retail consumers who are outside of the MLM participant pyramid. Many MLM companies will not disclose what percentage of its consumers are simultaneously their own participants. Other MLMs do not keep said figures {{because they do not}} differentiate between participant consumerism versus non-participant retail consumerism.|$|R
