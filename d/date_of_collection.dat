60|$|The {{documents}} {{which contain}} Indian mythology may be divided, broadly speaking, into four classes. First, and most ancient in date of composition, are {{the collections of}} hymns known as the Vedas. Next, and (as far as <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> goes) far less ancient, are the expository texts called the Brahmanas. Later still, come other manuals of devotion and of sacred learning, called Sutras and Upanishads; and last are the epic poems (Itihasas), and the books of legends called Puranas. We are chiefly concerned here with the Vedas and Brahmanas. A gulf of time, a period of social and literary change, separates the Brahmanas from the Vedas. But the epics and Puranas differ perhaps even still more from the Brahmanas, on account of vast religious changes which brought new gods into the Indian Olympus, or elevated to the highest place old gods formerly of low degree. From {{the composition of the}} first Vedic hymn to the compilation of the latest Purana, religious and mythopoeic fancy was never at rest.|$|E

50|$|The {{institute}} has {{a collection}} of over three million insects representing {{tens of thousands of}} species all recorded in Atta, a computer database that contains all of the data such as exact location (including GPS coordinates), <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> name of the collector and method of collection.|$|E
50|$|Minimum data {{associated}} with zoological specimens {{is the place}} and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> attached to the specimen by a label. Additional information {{is the name of}} the collector and the habitat. Tissue from specimens may be saved for genetic studies (molecular data, DNA). Depending on the animal group, other data may be included, for instance in bird collections the bird’s breeding condition, weight, colours of its eyes, bills and legs and nature of the stomach contents.|$|E
50|$|As a minimum, labels {{contain the}} place and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> and the {{identification}} of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin. There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.|$|E

50|$|The NFTL {{is merely}} a device which gives notice to {{interested}} parties {{of the existence of}} the federal tax lien. Thus, the NFTL's function is to perfect and obtain priority for the federal tax lien. The filing or refiling of the NFTL has no effect on the expiration <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> statute of limitations provided in Revenue Code §6502. Accordingly, even if the NFTL is refiled, if no event extends the collection statute of limitations, the IRS cannot take any further administrative collection action. Conversely, the IRS's failure to refile the NFTL does not affect the existence of an otherwise valid underlying federal tax lien, i.e., the underlying lien remains valid but loses its priority.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} of plant {{pressing}} begins with {{the collection of the}} sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.|$|E
50|$|There {{was much}} {{uncertainty}} surrounding the specimen, {{as it had}} no information on its place of origin or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection.</b> Sharpe is the origin of much of this confusion, but it actually started with Buller's 1887 description, when he misread {{the name on the}} label. Sharpe corrected this to inornata, but this was both unjustified (as Buller apparently really believed to have read mavornata) and in any case preoccupied, as Salvadori had already named another starling Calornis inornata in 1880. Thus, although Buller's description - a few throwaway lines in an account of the striated starling referring to the unique specimen - is barely sufficient and his name nonsensical, it is nonetheless valid according to ICZN rules.|$|E

50|$|American Indian art {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of Maryhill Museum's mission. Beginning with Sam Hill’s own collection, the Indian basketry holdings now total more than 900 items. A particularly important Indian art donation was made in 1940 by Mary Underwood Lane. She was the granddaughter of Cascade chief Welawa, also known as Chief Chenoweth. Lane’s gift included fur trade-era objects and many carved, woven and beaded items from the Middle Columbia River region. A large collection of Arctic material was given to the museum in 1979 by the heirs of Harvey T. Harding, who had operated a store in Nome, Alaska, from 1899 to 1907. Harding kept a journal of his Arctic experiences and a careful record of the objects that he collected—many of which are identified by place and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
50|$|The genus {{was first}} {{described}} by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyszewski in 1957. The type species is Lusitanosaurus liasicus. The generic name {{is derived from}} Lusitania, the ancient Latin name for the region. The specific name refers to the Lias. The holotype {{is part of the}} collection of the Museu de História Natural da Universidade de Lisboa. The exact location of the find and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> are unknown, which makes a correct geological dating difficult, but it can be inferred from the matrix rock that it has been discovered near São Pedro de Moel, in strata from the Sinemurian (Early Jurassic). This would make it the oldest known dinosaur from Portugal. The fossil consists of a single partial left maxilla, an upper jaw bone, with seven teeth.|$|E
50|$|Vermilacinia ceruchoides was {{described}} by Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler in 1994 in the genus Niebla, based on a type collected by R. E. Riefner, Jr. (exposed outcrops along W. Portero road near Lewis Road, about 5 km from the ocean, Reifner 89-588, ASU), presumably in 1989 according to his collection number style (also <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> questioned n Harvard University Herbaria database); however, it had been previously described by Richard Spjut in a manuscript under another name, V. pulvinata, dating from 1986, that was in press at the time Rundel and Bowler’s name was published. Spjut first collected the species on 30 April 1985 on a rock outcrop along a beach in northern Baja California near Cerro Solo as a voucher specimen (Spjut & Marin 9045, US) for a sample weighing 175 grams (WBA-113) for anti-HIV screening being conducted by the National Cancer Institute.|$|E
