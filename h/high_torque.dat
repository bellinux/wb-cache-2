5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting <b>high</b> <b>torque.</b> The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel triple-permanent-magnet-excited (TPME) {{magnetic}} gear (MG) {{with an extra}} stationary layer of permanent magnets (PMs) sandwiched between adjacent ferromagnetic segments to produce an additional torque and in which a simplified consequent-pole Halback array-type PM arrangement is employed to improve the magnetic field characteristic. The novel TPME-MG has a <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> transmission density when compared with its conventional counterpart. Its design method using the numerical finite-element method and the optimization algorithm is presented. The novel TPME-MG with optimal PM arrangement can significantly achieve <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> density and torque per PM volume. The results of finite-element computation show that the proposed TPME-MG with optimal PM arrangement has over 74 % <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> density (torque per unit overall volume) and more than 37 % <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> per PM volume compared with a conventional surface-mounted MG, and can reach 51 % <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> density and 34 % <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> per PM volume compared with an original design of TPME-MG, which validates {{the effectiveness of the}} design method for the PM arrangement in the novel TPME-MG.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the car was}} {{designed}} for a Wankel rotary engine. In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankels for cars and Jeep-type vehicles. (The agreement also permitted Curtiss-Wright to sell rotaries elsewhere.) Later, AMC decided instead to purchase the engines from General Motors (GM), who were developing them for use in their own cars. However, GM canceled development in 1974 for reasons that included durability issues, the fuel crisis, tooling costs (for the engines and also {{for a new product}} line designed {{to take advantage of the}} rotary's ultra-compact dimensions) and the upcoming (late 1970s) U.S. emissions legislation. It was also thought that the high-revving Wankel would not suit Americans accustomed to low revs and <b>high</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record {{back and forth on}} the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffness (or elastic modulus) can {{in theory}} affect the ride comfort and power {{transmission}} efficiency. [...] In practice, because even a very flexible frame {{is much more}} stiff than the tires and saddle, ride comfort is ultimately more a factor of saddle choice, frame geometry, tire choice, and bicycle fit. [...] Lateral stiffness is far more difficult to achieve because of the narrow profile of a frame, and too much flexibility can affect power transmission, primarily through tire scrub on the road due to rear triangle distortion, brakes rubbing on the rims and the chain rubbing on gear mechanisms. [...] In extreme cases gears can change themselves when the rider applies <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> out of the saddle.|$|E

2500|$|Diesel-electric HEVs use {{a diesel}} engine for power generation. Diesels have {{advantages}} when delivering constant power {{for long periods}} of time, suffering less wear while operating at higher efficiency. [...] The diesel engine's <b>high</b> <b>torque,</b> combined with hybrid technology, may offer substantially improved mileage. Most diesel vehicles can use 100% pure biofuels (biodiesel), so they can use but do not need petroleum at all for fuel (although mixes of biofuel and petroleum are more common). [...] If diesel-electric HEVs were in use, this benefit would likely also apply. Diesel-electric hybrid drivetrains have begun to appear in commercial vehicles (particularly buses); as of 2007, no light duty diesel-electric hybrid passenger cars are currently available, although prototypes exist. Peugeot is expected to produce a diesel-electric hybrid version of its 308 in late 2008 for the European market.|$|E
2500|$|Two-stage {{variable}} twin-turbos {{employ a}} small turbocharger at low speeds {{and a large}} one at higher speeds. They are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another, hence the name [...] "2-stage." [...] The distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable, so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally. Twin turbochargers are primarily used in Diesel engines. For example, in Opel bi-turbo Diesel, only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed, providing <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> at 1,500–1,700rpm. Both turbochargers operate together in mid range, with the larger one pre-compressing the air, which the smaller one further compresses. A bypass valve regulates the exhaust flow to each turbocharger. At higher speed (2,500 to 3,000 RPM) only the larger turbocharger runs.|$|E

However, the 1.2 HTP (<b>High</b> <b>Torque</b> Performance) engine was developed specifically for the Fabia and offers better performance and fuel economy, and was later used in Volkswagen's own Polo due to its high acclaim. It was also the highest displacement 3 cylinder petrol engine until 2014 and BMW's 1.5 litre 3 cylinder turbo engine.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent to {{completion}} of production car number one at Hethel, {{the company announced}} problems with transmission reliability.

In December 2007, Tesla announced plans to ship the initial Roadsters with the transmissions locked into second gear to provide [...] acceleration in 5.7 seconds. The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. According to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available. The EPA range of the car was also restated downward from [...] The downward revision was attributed to an error in equipment calibration at the laboratory that conducted the original test.|$|E
2500|$|The Insight’s IMA {{includes}} a high-efficiency, lightweight, low-friction 1.3-liter SOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine rated for [...] at 5800 rpm and [...] of torque from 1000–1700 rpm. The <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> at low rpm {{is made possible}} by the electric motor which contributes up to [...] at 1500 rpm and [...] of torque at 1000 rpm to the powertrain, assisting in acceleration and some steady state cruising situations at low-to-mid vehicle speeds. The motor acts as a generator during braking, steady cruising, gentle deceleration and coasting in order to recharge the IMA battery. The motor also serves as the engine starter, quickly spinning the engine to idle speed after Idle Stop and during normal vehicle starting. The system will automatically switch to a back-up, conventional 12-volt starter to start the engine if the IMA system is disabled or if the car is started at extreme cold temperatures. As an additional safety feature, Honda’s hybrid configuration allows the car to operate like a conventional, petrol-engine vehicle even if the IMA hybrid-electric motor system is completely disabled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{base engine}} was the [...] inline-six in all models except the Gran Torino Squire station wagon and the Gran Torino Sport which both had a 302-2V small-block V8 as standard.

The 400-2V {{was a new}} engine to the Torino line-up, and {{was part of the}} 335 series engine family like the 351 Cleveland. The 429-4V was not a high-performance engine like the Cobra Jets of previous years; instead, it was a <b>high</b> <b>torque,</b> low revving engine. Emissions, low lead and fuel economy requirements had become more strict for 1972. To meet these requirements, compression ratios on all Torino engines were dropped to at least 8.5:1, and all engines ran on regular gasoline. These engines generally produced less power than their predecessors in 1971, although this was exaggerated due to the switch to the new SAE net bhp ratings from the SAE gross figures used in 1971. As a result, the figures are not directly comparable. [...] All models came equipped with a three-speed manual transmission as a standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic remained optional, but was a mandatory option for the 351-2V, 400-2V and 429-4V. The 351-4V CJ required either the 4-speed or the Cruise-O-Matic as mandatory options.|$|E
