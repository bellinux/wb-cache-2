40|$|Refrigerant mass {{migration}} and redistribution {{are regarded as}} key factors affecting the cycling performance of air conditioning and refrigeration systems. A dynamic model of an R 134 a automotive air conditioning system is presented as an example in this paper to capture the refrigerant migration <b>during</b> compressor <b>shut-down</b> and start-up operations. Model validation against experimental data demonstrates {{the capabilities of the}} modeling approach in predicting the refrigerant {{mass migration}} among the components <b>during</b> <b>shut-down,</b> and the resulting refrigerant redistribution behaviors during start-up. These results represent the first refrigerant mass migration prediction in a validated dynamic system model. In addition, the potential of the dynamic modeling method in performance evaluation for possible product designs and control implementation for system cycling performance improvement is discussed in this paper...|$|R

Since the spindle oil often is used in textile factories it is also important that it doesn't stain the textiles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Experience {{with heat}} {{recovery}} steam generators (HRSGs) designed for larger-heat-input and higher-steam conditions highlights limitations in some features of traditional designs extrapo-lated from smaller HRSGs that operated predominantly continuously. Many combined-cycle units may {{be subjected to}} periods of regular overnight shut-down much earlier than expected and, unless anticipated during the initial design, there will be significant adverse impact on reliability and durability. Very premature problems already experienced on large HRSG designs in combined-cycle and cogeneration applications give an early warning that more widespread problems will arise as HRSGs are subjected to more thermal cycling. Problems that arise when inadequate attention is given to transient conditions over the full range of operation of the combined-cycle gas turbine unit, including at part loads, <b>during</b> <b>shut-downs</b> and restarts from diverse pre-start conditions, are highlighted. The paper gives examples of how the damage to HRSGs <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> and starts can be mitigated by minor modifications and sympathetic operating procedures and suggests how prudent purchasers can enhance reliability and lower lifetime costs at a small premium in installed cost by specification of appropriate design features. Other weaknesses which cause problems for operation and maintenance are discussed...|$|R
50|$|A pipe may {{experience}} expansion or contraction {{once it is}} subjected to temperatures higher or lower respectively as compared to temperature at which it was assembled. The secondary loads are often cyclic but not always.For example load due to tank settlement is not cyclic. The load due to vessel nozzle movement during operation is cyclic because the displacement is withdrawn <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> and resurfaces again after fresh start-up. A pipe subjected to a cycle of hot and cold fluid similarly undergoes cyclic loads and deformation.|$|R

For Main Injector (MI) this means at 8 -GeV kinetic energy for proton and pbar injections, at 150 -GeV extraction to Tevatron for collider operation, and at 120 -GeV extraction to Numi for nutrino experiment and slow spill to fixed target test beam facility.

40|$|Evaporators in big MSF-plants have {{traditionally}} been made of mild steel which should be cor-rosion resistant enough to cope with an environment of de-aerated seawater. However, experiences have proven that the environment is not always free of oxygen and corrosion has frequently occurred, especially <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> periods. One consequence is that a corrosion allowance has to be added and yet, protective layers in form of epoxy coatings and metallic linings are applied. Another alternative is to use solid stainless steel of the evaporator vessels. This paper will discuss {{the possibility of using}} two grades of ferritic-austenitic, or duplex, stainless steel for evaporators...|$|R
40|$|A {{segmented}} PEM {{fuel cell}} {{has been applied}} to measure spatial differences in key properties (polarization curves, electrochemical area and membrane resistance) of a fuel cell. The cell, consisting of 10 segments, was operated for 960 hours at a constant voltage of 0. 6 V. During this period the loss of electrochemical active platinum surface area increased linearly along the flow field of the cell from segment 1 to 10. The Pt degradation was interpreted to be caused by excess amounts of water near the cell outlet stemming from the electrochemically generated water from the preceding segments on the cathode. XRD analysis of selected segments of the cathode and membrane was performed post mortem and confirms the electrochemical measurements of the reduction of active Pt area. On the other hand, measurements of fuel crossover in the membrane during fuel cell testing and post mortem XRF analysis on a selection of membrane pieces showed no apparent degradation of the membrane material over the 960 h. Carbon corrosion rates were measured for four types of polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrode assemblies (MEAs) <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> air purging and start-up. The corrosion rates were measured at different purge rates, temperatures, and relative humidities. The highest amount of carbon corrosion occurs when gases are humidified and when using low ow rates for the air purging <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> and low hydrogen ow during start-up. Dry conditions give the highest rates of corrosion <b>during</b> <b>shut-down</b> when comparing the same ow rates of hydrogen and air, while humid conditions gives the highest rate of corrosion during start-up when comparing the same ow rates of hydrogen and air. The stability of different types of platinum surfaces in the presence of chloride was evaluated by applying a potential of 1. 2 V vs. RHE while the associated mass change of the Pt-electrode was monitored with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The platinum metal surfaces based on particles and films show a large difference towards dissolution when exposed to small amounts of chloride. While a platinum metal film showed no degradation in a sulfuric acid solution containing 10 ppm of chloride, an electrode made from a fuel cell catalyst (50 wt. % Pt/C) lost 10 percent of its platinum content over a 24 hour period when exposed to the same amount of chloride. At a chloride concentration of 20 ppm the onset potential of the Pt oxide formation increased ~ 200 mV compared to an electrode in a chloride free solution. The degradation of nanoparticles thus appears to be much more significant than for electrodeposited platinum electrodes. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|R
