6000|$|Of a Beatrice glorious, bright-- [...] Of a sainted, {{ethereal}} maid, [...] Whose blue <b>eyes</b> {{are deep}} <b>fountains</b> of light, [...] Cheering the poet that broodeth apart, [...] Filling with gladness his desolate heart, [...] Like the moon when she shines thro' a cloudless night [...] On {{a world of}} silence and shade.|$|R
60|$|It {{was this}} heart which God wished to breed in these rebellious Jews. A heart like Isaiah's heart, when he said, after having seen God's glory, 'Woe is me, for I {{am a man}} of unclean lips, and dwell among a people of unclean lips.' A heart like Jeremiah's heart, when he said, 'Oh, that my head were waters, and mine <b>eyes</b> a <b>fountain</b> of tears, that I might weep {{day and night for}} the slain of the {{daughter}} of my people.' A heart like Daniel's heart, when he confessed before God that, to him and all his people belonged shame and confusion of face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{sweet and}} {{faithful}} friend, my very sister! I am overpowered with feelings to which I have hitherto been a stranger. There {{is a cause}} for all this contest of my passions. It must out. My being has changed. The scales have fallen from my sealed <b>eyes,</b> and the <b>fountain</b> of my heart o'erflows. Life {{seems to have a}} new purpose, and existence a new cause. Listen to me, listen; and if you can, May, comfort me!' ...|$|R
50|$|Fifteen years later, on Christmas Eve, Billy, now 35, {{escapes from}} his cell and heads {{off to his}} former home, now a {{sorority}} house. At the Delta Alpha Kappa, Clair Crosby is killed in her bedroom being suffocated with a plastic bag before being stabbed in the <b>eye</b> with a <b>fountain</b> pen. Meanwhile, Megan Helms begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate. Upon finding Clair's body in a rocking chair, Megan is attacked and killed, suffocated with a plastic bag before her eyes are ripped out. In the living room, the other sorority girls receive {{a call from a}} rambling man, who ends the call threatening to kill them.|$|R
50|$|They had {{a united}} {{interest}} in books, and writing. The Library Club, that included shelving books, shelf reading, mending books, and others, evolved from {{just being a}} way to earn service hours but a place for young minds to explore, learn, and come to love writing. The Young Authors' Club was born; its job is to publish student work under a number of conditions. Thus, The Ninety-fives {{became one of the}} first in the YAC club, penning the book that would take many lunch hours, recess, and months to complete, with the careful <b>eye</b> of Ms. <b>Fountain,</b> one of the Librarians, checking and reading over their work, they were on their way.|$|R
60|$|O {{that they}} that read me could but feel me! for {{my heart is}} {{affected}} with this merciful visitation of the Father of lights and spirits to this poor nation, {{and the whole world}} through the same testimony. Why should the inhabitants thereof reject it? Why should they lose the blessed benefit of it? Why should they not turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and say from the heart, Speak Lord, for now thy poor servants hear: O that thy will may be done, thy great, thy good, and holy will, in earth as it is in heaven! do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us; for we are thine, and desire to glorify thee our Creator, both for that, and because thou art our Redeemer; for thou art redeeming us from the earth, from the vanities and pollutions of it, to be a peculiar people unto thee. O! this were a brave day for England, if so she could say in truth! but alas, the case is otherwise! for which some of thine inhabitants, O land of my nativity! have mourned over thee with bitter wailing and lamentation. Their heads have been, indeed, as waters, and their <b>eyes</b> as <b>fountains</b> of tears, because of thy transgression and stiffneckedness; because thou wilt not hear, and fear, and return to the Rock, even thy Rock, O England! from whence thou art hewn. But be thou warned, O land of great profession, to receive him into thy heart. Behold, at that door it is he hath stood so long knocking; but thou wilt yet have none of him. O! be thou awakened! lest Jerusalem's judgments do swiftly overtake thee, because of Jerusalem's sins that abound in thee. For she abounded in formality, but made void the weighty things of God's law, as thou daily dost.|$|R
60|$|The folding-doors swung quickly back, {{and left}} him {{standing}} behind the pillar, in the solitude of the outer hall. There Eurylochus waited until he was quite weary, and listened eagerly to every sound, but without hearing anything that could help him to guess {{what had become of}} his friends. Footsteps, it is true, seemed to be passing and repassing {{in other parts of the}} palace. Then there was a clatter of silver dishes, or golden ones, which made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting-hall. But by and by he heard a tremendous grunting and squealing, and then a sudden scampering, like that of small, hard hoofs over a marble floor, while the voices of the mistress and her four handmaidens were screaming all together, in tones of anger and derision. Eurylochus could not conceive what had happened, unless a drove of swine had broken into the palace, attracted by the smell of the feast. Chancing to cast his <b>eyes</b> at the <b>fountain,</b> he saw that it did not shift its shape, as formerly, nor looked either like a long-robed man, or a lion, a tiger, a wolf, or an ass. It looked like nothing but a hog, which lay wallowing in the marble basin, and filled it from brim to brim.|$|R
60|$|It was high-noon when Melchior de Willading and his venerable friend led the {{way across}} the foaming Rhone, at the celebrated bridge of St Maurice. Here the country of the Valais, then like Geneva, an ally, and not a confederate of the Swiss cantons, was entered, and all objects, both animate and inanimate, began to assume that mixture of the grand, the sterile, the luxuriant, and the revolting, for which this region is so {{generally}} known. Adelheid gave an involuntary shudder, her imagination having been prepared by rumor for even more than the truth would have given reason to expect, when the gate of St. Maurice swung back upon its hinges, literally inclosing the party in this wild, desolate, and yet romantic region. As they proceeded along the Rhone, however, she and those of her companions to whom the scene was new, were constantly wondering at some unlooked-for discrepancy, that drove them from admiration to disgust--from the exclamations of delight to the chill of disappointment. The mountains on every side were dreary, and without the rich relief of the pastured eminences, but most of the valley was rich and generous. In one spot a sac d'eau, one of those reservoirs of water which form among the glaciers on the summits of the rocks, had broken, and, descending like a water-spout, it had swept before it every vestige of cultivation, covering wide breadths of the meadows with a débris that resembled chaos. A frightful barrenness, and the most smiling fertility, were in absolute contact: patches of green, that had been accidentally favored by some lucky formation of the ground, sometimes appearing like oases of the desert, in the very centre of a sterility that would put the labor and the art of man at defiance for a century. In the midst of this terrific picture of want sat a crétin, with his semi-human attributes, the lolling tongue, the blunted faculties, and the degraded appetites, to complete the desolation. Issuing from this belt of annihilated vegetation, the scene became again as pleasant as the fancy could desire, or the <b>eye</b> crave. <b>Fountains</b> leaped from rock to rock in the sun's rays; the valley was green and gentle; the mountains began to show varied and pleasing forms; and happy smiling faces appeared, whose freshness and regularity were perhaps of a cast superior to that of most of the Swiss. In short, the Valais was then; as now, a country of opposite extremes, but in which, perhaps, there is a predominance of the repulsive and inhospitable.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{hope you}} {{received}} my last in which I spoke of Dear little Lydia [...] being unwell. Now with deep sorrow I {{must tell you}} that yesterday I [...] assisted in laying her dear remains in the lonely grave. She died at [...] 7 o’clock on Wednesday evening, I suppose by the time you had got the [...] letter. The Dr. did not think it was croup till late on Tuesday [...] night, and all that Medical aid could prescribe was done, but the Dr. [...] had no hope after he saw that the croup was confirmed, and hard [...] indeed would the heart have been that would not have melted at seeing [...] what the dear little creature suffered all Wednesday until the feeble [...] frame was quite worn out. She was quite sensible till within 2 hours [...] of her death, and then she sunk quite low till the vital spark fled, [...] and all medicine that she got she took with the greatest readiness, [...] as if apprehensive they would make her well. I cannot well describe [...] my feelings on the occasion. I thought that the fountain-head of my [...] tears had now been dried up, but I have been mistaken, for I must [...] confess that the briny rivulets descended fast on my furrowed cheeks, [...] she was such a winning Child, and had such a regard for me and always [...] came and told me all her little things, and as she was now speaking, [...] some of her little prattle was very taking, and the lively images of [...] these things intrude themselves more into my mind than they should [...] do, but there is allowance for moderate grief on such occasions. But [...] when I am telling you of my own grief and sorrow, I know not what to [...] say of the bereaved Mother, she hath not met with anything in this [...] world before that hath gone so near the quick with her. She had no [...] handling of the last one as she was not able at the time, for she [...] only had her once in her arms, and her affections had not time to be [...] so fairly entwined around her. I am much afraid that she will not [...] soon if ever get over this trial. Although she was weakly before, [...] yet she was pretty well recovered, but this hath not only affected [...] her mind, but her body is so much affected that she is not well able [...] to sit so long as her bed is making and hath scarcely tasted meat [...] [i.e. food] since Monday night, and till some time is elapsed we [...] cannot say how she may be. There is none that is not a Parent [...] themselves that can fully sympathise with one in such a state. David [...] is much affected also, but it is not so well known on him, and the [...] younger branches of the family are affected but it will be only [...] momentary. But alas in all this vast ado, there is only the sorrow [...] of the world which worketh death. O how gladdening would it be if we [...] were in as great bitterness for sin as for the loss of a first-born. [...] O how unfitted persons or families is for trials who knows not the [...] divine art of casting all their cares upon the Lord, and what [...] multitudes are there that when earthly comforts is taken away, may [...] well say What have I more? all their delight is placed in some one [...] thing or another in the world, and who can blame them for unwillingly [...] parting with what they esteem their chief good? O that we were wise [...] to lay up treasure for the time of need, for it is truly a solemn [...] affair to enter the lists with the king of terrors. It is strange [...] that the living lay the things so little to heart until they have to [...] engage in that war where there is no discharge. O that my head were [...] waters and mine <b>eyes</b> a <b>fountain</b> of tears that I might weep day and [...] night for my own and others’ stupidity in this great matter. O for [...] grace to do every day work in its proper time and to live above the [...] tempting cheating train of earthly things. The rest of the family [...] are moderately well. I have been for some days worse than I have [...] been for 8 months past, but I may soon get better. I am in the same [...] way I have often been in before, but there is no security for it [...] always being so, for I know that it cannot be far from the time when [...] I will be one of those that once were. I have no other news to send [...] you, and as little heart for them. I hope you will take the earliest [...] opportunity of writing that you can, and be particular as regards [...] Margaret, for she requires consolation.’ ...|$|R
