The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the <b>Earth</b> <b>Summit</b> in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 <b>Earth</b> <b>Summit</b> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E

25|$|Desertification, another {{important}} environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, {{also known as}} the <b>Earth</b> <b>Summit,</b> held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid caatinga ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.|$|E
25|$|For major mining {{companies}} and any company seeking international financing, {{there are a}} number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles, IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing. Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry self-regulation. In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio <b>Earth</b> <b>Summit</b> by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.|$|E

The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 <b>Earth</b> <b>Summits</b> were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission.

CNN aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to Rio de Janeiro for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (<b>Earth</b> <b>Summit).</b> The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she {{not be allowed to}} speak at the summit.

In addition, it depicts the cyclical patterns of political activity dealing with sustainability and identiﬁ es the main sustainability goals and targets endorsed by several political initiatives.

It is concluded that global sustainability governance followed an intermittent path characterized by two periods of signiﬁ cant accomplishments (until 1979; 1987 – 1995) and by two others less suc- cessful (1980 – 1986; 1995 onwards, interrupted by a peak around 2000). Peaks in political activity coincide with the decennial <b>Earth</b> <b>Summits,</b> suggesting their major inﬂ uence as catalysts of more profound societal and political action.
