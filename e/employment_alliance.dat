40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was special {{education}} teachers, who remained in the teaching field 5 or more years. Through the use of qualitative mixed-methods study, variables contributing to their longevity were explored. Research indicates that 50 % of special education teachers leave the field within five years of <b>employment</b> (<b>Alliance</b> for Education, 2004). For the study, 22 teachers from different school districts, as well as different geographical parts of the U. S., were interviewed. One man and 21 women, all with more than five years of experience were interviewed. Data obtained from these interviews was organized into six themes. Themes identified were: Children and How They Contribute to Longevity, Administrative Support, Opportunity to Collaborate and Network, They Felt it Was A Special Calling, What They Do is Appreciated, and The Freedom to Teach What Students Need. Each theme is explored in depth to determine its contribution to the understanding of longevity for special education teachers. Implications for the retention of special education teachers are presented. ...|$|E

50|$|Testimony of the {{plaintiff}} occupied {{most of the}} second week. She described mentoring Wen Hsieh and recalled hearing about three administrative assistants who were harassed by Nazre. When questioned about this, Pao knew only {{that one of their}} first names was Tina, inviting theories that the women had settled with Kleiner Perkins and signed non-disclosure agreements. On cross-examination, Hermle found an inconsistency with Pao's deposition video {{on the question of whether}} she asked to see an Equal Opportunity Employment policy. She also sought to show evidence of plotting in 2011 and 2012 by bringing up emails in which Pao discussed her options with friend and Google engineer Lori Park. These revealed that Pao had applied for jobs at YouTube and Menlo Ventures and was considering starting her own firm. Some issues with how Pao responded to termination were also raised. Pao said that it made sense for her to break the news to the CEOs of the three companies in her immediate network but revealed that Ted Schlein chastised her for doing so. On the stand, Pao objected to the way <b>Employment</b> Law <b>Alliance</b> investigator Stephen Hirschfeld responded to the discrimination complaints by Trae Vassallo and herself. She alleged that the reports used biased language, softened the airplane incident by changing the name of a pornographic show to Entourage and focused on eliminating KPCB's liability rather than addressing the concerns of employees. When Hirschfeld was questioned by Lawless, he revealed that his reports did not include a matrix which Vassallo used to tabulate discrepancies between male and female partners. This criticism was repeated by Allison West of Employment Practices Specialists who testified that the firm's investigation of gender issues was insufficient. She also commented that it was circular for the defendant to rely heavily on performance reviews to discredit Pao's allegations against the people writing them.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the historical influences and chronological development of foreign investors on Malaysian Bumiputera (indigenous) new technology-based small firms (NTBSFs). Design/methodology/approach: Weick&# 039;s (1989) conceptual theory building approach is used to conduct a critical historical documentary analysis of the international, local, academic and government inward foreign investments literature from prior Malaysia&# 039;s independence (1957) through to 2016. Findings: Increased foreign investment between 1957 and 2016 proved to be effective for Malaysia to transform its economy from a reliance on primary production to a focus on innovation and value-added industries such as the biotechnology and the information and communication and technology sectors. Research limitations/implications: Local and international literature addressing inward foreign investments towards host countries yielded four key research implications: <b>employment</b> effects, strategic <b>alliances,</b> technology transfer and knowledge transfer. Creation of firm-specific resources in addition to government assistance, particularly through grants and advisory services, significantly contribute to the sustainability of Bumiputera NTBSFs. Practical implications: Inward foreign investment through subsidiary multi-national companies (MNCs) leads to the formation of strategic alliances between MNCs and Bumiputera NTBSFs, generating employment opportunities, contributing to Malaysia&# 039;s development aims. Social implications: Charting the chronological development and historical influence of foreign investment from a Malay-Bumiputera perspective provides an in-depth understanding of the evolution of what is now a multi-cultural Malaysian society. Originality/value: This study provides a chronological development and discussion of the historical influences and implications of foreign investment towards the evolution and sustainability of Malaysi...|$|R

This project was completed {{as part of the}} 2016 - 2017 Resilient Communities Project (rcp. umn. edu) partnership with the City of Brooklyn Park. Unemployment rates in Brooklyn Park and Brooklyn Center are higher than those for Minnesota as a whole. The Brooklyn Bridge Alliance for Youth works with young people in both cities, and one aspect of their work is preparing students for college and careers. The goal of this project was to define youth employment, determine benchmarks to measure youth readiness for college, and create an assessment tool {{to determine whether or not}} youth in the Brooklyns are on a career and education path to <b>employment.</b> Brooklyn Bridge <b>Alliance</b> for Youth staff member Ivan Lui worked with a team of students in for students in PA 5251 : Strategic Planning and Management, to develop recommendations for the Brooklyns to better measure youth employment and more fully understand the career and employment needs of young people in the two cities. The students' final report {{and presentation}} are available. This project was supported by the Resilient Communities Project (RCP), a program at the University of Minnesota whose mission is to connect communities in Minnesota with U of MN faculty and students to advance local sustainability and resilience through collaborative, course-based projects.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the dynamic capabilities view has essentially extended the resource-based view, while also providing an integrated framework for {{an understanding of how}} firms evolve and how they secure competitive advantage in rapidly changing environments. While much research into dynamic capabilities has been developed in the theoretical and qualitative arenas, there has of yet been limited empirical support for its core assumptions. Such a limitation, authors have noted, may be due to its equivocal framework and the lack of a model with specified antecedents. This research conducts both conceptual and empirical works to address this gap. The primary goal of the research is to clarify the conceptual structure of dynamic capabilities, while also investigating potential micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities and their influences on firm performance. These micro-foundations, as the research traces back to the origins of dynamic capability from much firm capability and strategic management literature, could potentially include innovation, processual formalisation, social integration platforms (i. e. employee training and education) and the application of information technology. Alternatively, the research also looks into a possible extension of the dynamic capabilities view by extending inter-firm activities. In this part, the exploratory focus is on the relationship between a firm’s intended actions and its <b>employment</b> of <b>alliance</b> portfolios for capability and resource development. Using a subsample in the Australian manufacturing SME sector (from the Business Longitudinal Survey), the research finds a significant mediating effect of market transformation on the inter-relationships within the nexus of dynamic capabilities and firm performance. The empirical evidence of the research suggests that a firm’s dynamic capabilities are able to be viewed as a driver of competitive performance of firms insofar as they become evident in marketplaces. In other words, a firm’s development of dynamic capabilities confers upon the firm an adaptive capability in response to, or indeed perceiving, market dynamics, which in turn leads to superior performance. For the issue of inter-firm capability development, the research also finds that a firm’s capability development is indeed able to be achieved through some potential inter-firm specific activities. The empirical findings suggest that, for a purpose of capability development, alliance portfolios employed by a firm are able to be viewed as an approach to filling its resource stock or exploiting a perceived opportunity in its operational and strategic environments. In addition to the provision of empirical evidence, the research also extends the discussion of capability development by utilising a contextual case discussion in Taiwan’s ICT industry. Comparing strategy adoptions between OBM and OEM/ODM from Taiwan’s ICT businesses, the research reveals that many firms’ long-term and successful path dependencies that are absent the mediating arrangements discussed above may in fact form an obstacle to financial performance and growth into new business locales.
