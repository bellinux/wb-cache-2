40|$|Callus {{cultures}} of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L. cv Valencia Tennessee Red) cotyledons grown on Linsmaier and Skoog medium containing normal levels of auxin and cytokinin do not synthesize either 4 -methyl-eneglutamic acid or 4 -methyleneglutamine, which nonprotein amino acids are normally found in significant amounts in peanut plants. If mature peanut embryos (with cotyledons removed) are germinated and grown {{on a similar}} medium containing no added phytohormone, normal levels of these two amino acids accumulate. The addition of an auxin, however, prevents formation of 4 -methyleneglutamic acid and 4 -methyleneglutamine; typical levels of other free amino acids are seen and excised embryos so cultured develop into apparently otherwise normal plants.

40|$|The {{first report}} of {{replication}} of Riley's plasma enzyme-elevating virus (Riley virus) in tissue culture was by Yaffe (1), 2 {{years after the}} discovery of the virus in 1960 (2).

However, when an infected culture was serially trypsinized and replated, infective Riley virus was lost after the 2 nd passage, and the passaged cultures were insusceptible to a 2 nd infection. Similarly, passaged uninfected cultures also became insusceptible to infection. Subsequently, preliminary experiments were reported by Plagemann et al.
