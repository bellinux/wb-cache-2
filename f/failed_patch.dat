40|$|A {{model of}} a ductile fault zone is {{incorporated}} into a forward 3 -D earthquake model to better constrain fault-zone hydraulics. The conceptual framework of the model fault zone was chosen such that two distinct parts are recognized. The fault core, characterized by a relatively low permeability, is composed of a coseismic fault surface embedded in a visco-elastic volume that can creep and compact. The fault core is surrounded by, and mostly sealed from, a high permeability damaged zone. The model fault properties correspond explicitly {{to those of the}} coseismic fault core. Porosity and pore pressure evolve to account for the viscous compaction of the fault core, while stresses evolve in response to the applied tectonic loading and to shear creep of the fault itself. A small diffusive leakage is allowed {{in and out of the}} fault zone. Coseismically, porosity is created to account for frictional dilatancy. We show in the case of a 3 -D fault model with no in-plane flow and constant fluid compressibility, pore pressures do not drop to hydrostatic levels after a seismic rupture, leading to an overpressured weak fault. Since pore pressure plays a key role in the fault behaviour, we investigate coseismic hydraulic property changes. In the full 3 -D model, pore pressures vary instantaneously by the poroelastic effect during the propagation of the rupture. Once the stress state stabilizes, pore pressures are incrementally redistributed in the <b>failed</b> <b>patch.</b> We show that the significant effect of pressure-dependent fluid compressibility in the no in-plane flow case becomes a secondary effect when the other spatial dimensions are considered because in-plane flow with a near-lithostatically pressured neighbourhood equilibrates at a pressure much higher than hydrostatic levels, forming persistent high-pressure fluid compartments. If the observed faults are not all overpressured and weak, other mechanisms, not included in this model, must be at work in nature, which need to be investigated. Significant leakage perpendicular to the fault strike (in the case of a young fault), or cracks hydraulically linking the fault core to the damaged zone (for a mature fault) are probable mechanisms for keeping the faults strong and might play a significant role in modulating fault pore pressures. Therefore, fault-normal hydraulic properties of fault zones should be a future focus of field and numerical experiment...|$|E

Considering that there exist {{a host of}} IoT devices (e.g., smart meters, smart inverters) similar in each of networked microgrids, a dedicated database can be configured as a blockchain for keeping track of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the corresponding patches. When a cybersecurity vulnerability is discovered and cured in a microgrid, all the other microgrids will also patch the vulnerability. Each microgrid monitors and validates the integrity and effectiveness of new patches which will ultimately be stored on the blockchain and made available automatically to networked microgrids. If a microgrid <b>fails</b> to <b>patch</b> the vulnerability, it will be marked as a potential target for lowing its credit score by a penalty, and eventually excluded from the transactive energy system if necessary.

40|$|In the In the h-type {{adaptive}} analysis, when {{an element}} is refined or subdivided, new nodes are added. Among {{them are the}} transition nodes which are the corner nodes of the new elements formed by subdivision and, simultaneously, the mid-side nodes of the adjacent non-subdivided elements. To secure displacement compatibility, the slave-node approach in which the DOFs of a transition node are constrained by those of the adjacent nodes had been used. Alternatively, transition elements which possess the transition nodes as active mid-side/-face nodes can be used. For C 0 plate analyses, the conventional slave-node constraints and the previously derived ANS transition elements are implemented. In both implementations, the four-node element is the ANS element. With reference to the predictions of the transition elements, the slave-node approach not only delivers erroneous results but also <b>fails</b> the <b>patch</b> test. In this paper, the patch test failure is resolved by developing a set of new constraints with which the slave-node approach surpasses the transition-element approach. The accuracy of the slave-node approach is further improved by developing a hybrid four-node element in which the assumed moment and shear force modes are in strict equilibrium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three novel hybrid-stress six-node prismatic elements. Starting {{from the}} element displacement interpolation, the equilibrating non-constant stress modes {{for the first}} element are identified and orthogonalized {{with respect to the}} constant stress modes for higher computational efficiency. For the second element, the non-constant stress modes are non-equilibrating and chosen for the sake of stabilizing the reduced-integrated element. The first two elements are intended for three-dimensional continuum analysis with both passing the patch test for three-dimensional continuum elements. The third element is primarily intended for plate/shell analysis. Shear locking is alleviated by a new assumed strain scheme which preserves the element accuracy with respect to the twisting load. Furthermore, the Poisson's locking along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions is overcome by using the hybrid-stress modes of the first element. The third element passes the patch test for plate/shell elements. Unless the element assumes the right prismatic geometry, it <b>fails</b> the <b>patch</b> test for three-dimensional continuum elements. It will be seen that all the proposed elements are markedly more accurate than the conventional fully integrated element. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} is a {{key technology}} for self-healing systems designed to prevent or manage damage caused by security threats. Protecting web server-based applications using intrusion detection is challenging, especially when autonomy is required (i. e., without signature updates or extensive administrative overhead).

Anomaly-based intrusion detection has been proposed as a strategy to meet these requirements. This paper describes how DFA induction {{can be used to}} detect malicious web requests. The method is used in combination with rules for reducing variability among requests and heuristics for filtering and grouping anomalies.

40|$|Introduction In January 2006, the Renal Dialysis Unit at Geelong Hospital {{appointed}} a Vascular Access Nurse. A Transonic Flow Qc HDO 2 Ultrasound Dilution Monitor was purchased to monitor access flow and recirculation in arteriovenous fistulae {{in an attempt}} to predict AVF stenoses requiring early surgical correction. Methods A bi-monthly monitoring program tested all facility-based patients. 82 patients were assessed for access flow and recirculation between February and December 2006. Results 18 (22 %) had poor AVF function; 13 with access flows 25 % over a four month period. Of the 18 patients shown to have poor access flow, 2 died within one month of measurement while 5 were too frail to attempt corrective surgery. The remaining 11 proceeded to ultrasound or fistulography. A > 50 % stenosis was detected in all 11 cases. Of these, 4 had successful vein patch surgery and one had PTFE grafting, each with marked improvement in access flow. One had <b>failed</b> vein <b>patch</b> surgery requiring creation of a femoral AVF, one patient required cvc insertion to await AVF creation, and one had failed stenting requiring a permanent cvc. 3 died before planned surgery. Conclusion 5 of the 82 patients that had access flow assessment, and needed further evaluation, proceeded to successful pre-emptive surgical intervention. We believe the Transonic is a useful adjunct to routine clinical AVF surveillance, in providing early evidence of AVF failure that can be avoided by pre-emptive surgery. <br /...|$|R

Herein, we identify the transcription factor IRF 4 as a T-cell intrinsic precondition for TFH cell differentiation and GC formation. After immunization with protein or infection with the protozoon Leishmania major, draining lymph nodes (LNs) of IFN-regulatory factor- 4 (Irf 4 −/−) mice lacked GCs and GC B cells despite developing normal initial hyperplasia.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focus on}} automorphy lifting theorems and related questions. There are two primary components. The first deals with residually dihedral Galois representations. Namely, fix an odd prime p, and consider a continuous geometric representation ρ: G_F →_n(O), where F {{is either a}} totally real field if n= 2, or a CM field if n> 2, and O is the integer ring of a finite extension of Q_p. The goal is to prove the automorphy of representations whose residual representation ρ̅ has the property that the restriction to G_F(ζ_p) is reducible, where ζ_p denotes a primitive p-th root of unity. This means the classical Taylor-Wiles hypothesis <b>fails</b> and classical <b>patching</b> techniques do not suffice to prove the automorphy of ρ. Building off the work of Thorne, we prove an automorphy theorem in the n= 2 case and apply the result to elliptic curves. The case n> 2 is examined briefly as well. The second component deals with the generic unobstructedness of compatible systems of adjoint representations. Namely, given a compatible system of representations, one can consider the adjoints of the residual representations and determine whether the second Galois cohomology group with the adjoints as coefficients vanishes for infinitely many primes. Such a question relates to classical problems such as Leopoldt's conjecture. While theorems are hard to prove, we discuss heuristics and provide computational evidence...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{temperature}} anomalies that develop in the shallow subsurface {{as a result of}} localized deforestation in combination with shallow horizontal groundwater flow. Model results show how a patch-wise pattern of deforestation at the surface induces significant lateral temperature gradients in the subsurface. Results also indicate that lateral heat transport by advection via horizontal groundwater flow becomes significant above flow rates of about 10 − 8 m/s. In a steady state situation, reached 1750 a after deforestation, an anomaly of 0. 1 K is still present at a distance of ∼ 2. 5 km downstream of the deforested patch at depths between 200 and 575 m for horizontal groundwater flow velocities between 10 − 7 m/s and 10 − 8 m/s, respectively. We carried out transient simulations to examine the impact of deforestation on subsurface temperatures during the last century. These experiments include a study of the effects of regional surface warming on the thermal regime of the subsurface. In these scenarios, 100 a after localized deforestation, significant temperature anomalies occur hundreds of meters downstream of the deforested areas. Results show that ground surface temperature history reconstructions based upon synthetic temperature versus depth profiles up- and downstream of the deforested <b>patches</b> <b>fail</b> to recover the timing and magnitude of the warming event imposed at the surface.

Improving vision in adult amblyopia by perceptual learning. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101 (17), 6692 – 6697]. Between blocks, children played a computer game to engage and maintain their attention in order to increase compliance. Each child received two treatment sessions a week, with a total of not more than 40 sessions. Each session lasted for about 1 h and included a total practice time of about 30 min. The age of the children (n= 5) was between 7 and 8 years (mean 7. 3 years). For the whole group, the average improvement in visual acuity was 1. 5 Snellen lines or 2. 12 ETDRS lines.

40|$|Submersed aquatic {{vegetation}} (SAV) {{is sensitive}} to changes in environmental conditions and {{plays an important role}} as a long-term indictor for the trophic state of freshwater lakes. Variations in water level height, nutrient condition, light availability and water temperature affect the growth and species composition of SAV. Detailed information about seasonal variations in littoral bottom coverage are still unknown, although these effects are expected to mask climate change-related long-term changes, as derived by snapshots of standard monitoring methods included in the European Water Framework Directive. Remote sensing offers concepts to map SAV quickly, within large areas, and at short intervals. This study analyses the potential of a semi-empirical method to map littoral bottom coverage by a multi-seasonal approach. Depth-invariant indices were calculated for four Atmospheric & Topographic Correction (ATCOR 2) atmospheric corrected RapidEye data sets acquired at Lake Kummerow, Germany, between June and August 2015. RapidEye data evaluation was supported by in situ measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the water column and bottom reflectance. The processing chain was able to differentiate between SAV and sandy sediment. The successive increase of SAV coverage from June to August was correctly monitored. Comparisons with in situ and Google Earth imagery revealed medium accuracies (kappa coefficient = 0. 61, overall accuracy = 72. 2 %). The analysed time series further revealed how water constituents and temporary surface phenomena such as sun glint or algal blooms influence the identification success of lake bottom substrates. An abundant algal bloom biased the interpretability of shallow water substrate such that a differentiation of sediments and SAV <b>patches</b> <b>failed</b> completely.

40|$|Abstract. Proof {{critics are}} a {{technology}} from the proof planning paradigm. They examine failed proof attempts {{in order to}} extract information {{which can be used}} to generate a patch which will allow the proof to go through. We consider the proof of the &quot;whisky problem&quot;, a challenge problem from the domain of temporal logic. The proof requires a generalisation of the original conjecture and we examine two proof critics which can be used to create this generalisation. Using these critics we believe we have produced the first automatic proofs of this challenge problem. We use this example to motivate a comparison of the two critics and propose that there is a place for specialist critics as well as powerful general critics. In particular we advocate the development of critics that do not use meta-variables. 1 Introduction Proof planning is an AI-search based technique for automated proof. It has been applied with particular success to proofs by mathematical induction. A significant component of proof planning is the use of critics to <b>patch</b> <b>failed</b> proof attempts based upon {{the way in which the}} proof is proceeding. Proof critics exist which provide generalisations, speculate missing lemmas and revise induction schemes. The &quot;whisky problem &quot; is a challenge problem from the domain of first order temporal logic. Its proof requires induction and a generalisation of the original conjecture. Proof critics appeared to be an obvious technology to use in an attempt to provide an automated proof of this theorem. We use the whisky problem here as a basis for the examination of two generalisation critics. The first of these uses meta-variables which are gradually instantiated as a proof progresses. The second is a more specialised equivalent which did not use such meta-variables. The second critic proved more robust to slight changes to the context in which the proof attempt was performed and illustrated that it is sometimes beneficial to favour a less general solution (if one is available) ...|$|R

The effects of drugs targeting the BK channels in neuronal and smooth muscle tissues in the human SH-SY 5 Y cell and mouse Neuro 2 A undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells have never been investigated. The expression/activity of BK channel subunits and the effects of the BK channel openers: acetazolamide (ACTZ) (10 - 7 - 2 × 10 - 4 M), resveratrol (RESV) (10 - 7 - 2 × 10 - 4 M), dichlorphenamide (DCP) (10 - 12 - 2 × 10 - 4 M), bendroflumethiazide (BFT) (10 - 9 - 10 - 5 M) and riluzole (RIL) (10 - 6 - 10 - 4 M) were evaluated by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) /patch-clamp experiments in SH-SY 5 Y cells and Neuro 2 a. Cell proliferation was evaluated by cell-dehydrogenase activity (CCK 8 -assay), cell impedentiometric (Scepter-counter) and clonogenic assays. An elevated expression/activity of the hslo 1 -BK channel subunit was observed in the SH-SY 5 Y, while a low expression/activity of this subunit was found in the Neuro 2 a. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) (1 - 5 x 10 - 3) and iberiotoxin (IbTX) (10 - 9 - 6 × 10 - 7 M) caused a marked inhibition of the whole-cell K+-currents in SH-SY 5 Y. A mild inhibition of the K+-currents was found in Neuro 2 a with these compounds. The application of ACTZ, DCP, RESV and BFT to the <b>patches</b> <b>failed</b> to activate the K+-currents but rather reduced it. The rank order of efficacy of the drugs as K+-current inhibitors at + 30 mV (Vm) was: TEA > RESV ≥ IbTX > DCP > ACTZ > BFT. RESV and IbTX irreversibly reduced the K+-currents and the cell number in the enzymatic, clonogenic and impedentiometric assays with RESV being more effective than IbTX. TEA reversibly reduced the K+-currents without affecting cell proliferation. Whereas, RIL potentiated the BK current and reduced cell-dehydrogenases activity with no changes in the cell morphology and number. The observed irreversible BK channel-blocking action exerted by RESV and IbTX can be associated with anti-proliferative effects in cells overexpressing hslo 1 -BK channel subunit. This can be an additional mechanism contributing to the cytotoxic action of RESV in SH-SY 5 Y cells...|$|R
40|$|The early {{version of}} the Internet was {{designed}} for connectivity only, without the consideration of security, and the Internet is consequently an open structure. Networked systems are vulnerable {{for a number of}} reasons; design error, implementation, and management. A vulnerability is a hole or weak point that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. Operating systems and applications are often vulnerable because of design errors. Software vendors release patches for discovered vulnerabilities, and rely upon system administrators to accept and install patches on their systems. Many system administrators <b>fail</b> to install <b>patches</b> on time, and consequently leave their systems vulnerable to exploitation by hackers. This exploitation can result in various security breaches, including website defacement, denial of service, or malware attacks. The overall problem is significant with an average of 115 vulnerabilities per week being documented during 2005. This thesis considers the problem of vulnerabilities in IT networked systems, and maps the vulnerability types into a technical taxonomy. The thesis presents a thorough analysis of the existing methods of vulnerability management which determine that these methods have failed to mange the problem in a comprehensive way, and show the need for a comprehensive management system, capable of addressing the awareness and patch deploymentp roblems. A critical examination of vulnerability databasess tatistics {{over the past few years}} is provided, together with a benchmarking of the problem in a reference environment with a discussion of why a new approach is needed. The research examined and compared different vulnerability advisories, and proposed a generic vulnerability format towards automating the notification process. The thesis identifies the standard process of addressing vulnerabilities and the over reliance upon the manual method. An automated management system must take into account new vulnerabilities and patch deploymentt o provide a comprehensives olution. The overall aim of the research has therefore been to design a new framework to address these flaws in the networked systems harmonised with the standard system administrator process. The approach, known as AVMS (Automated Vulnerability Management System), is capable of filtering and prioritising the relevant messages, and then downloading the associated patches and deploying them to the required machines. The framework is validated through a proof-of-concept prototype system. A series of tests involving different advisories are used to illustrate how AVMS would behave. This helped to prove that the automated vulnerability management system prototype is indeed viable, and that the research has provided a suitable contribution to knowledge in this important domain.
