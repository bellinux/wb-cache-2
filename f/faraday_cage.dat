5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a <b>faraday</b> <b>cage</b> effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
5|$|The burglar Lady Christina de Souza steals a gold chalice once {{belonging}} to King Æthelstan from a London museum, {{replacing it with}} a maneki neko model, and hops on a 200 bus. The Doctor later joins her and the other passengers, just before the bus passes through a wormhole and ends up on the sands of the planet San Helios. The Doctor studies the wormhole and determines that the bus protected them from its effects like a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage,</b> and is too late from stopping the driver from stepping back through. When the driver's skeleton appears on Earth, UNIT forces are alerted, led by Captain Erisa Magambo and aided by scientific adviser Malcolm Taylor.|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} the visa in August 1939 and sailed out of Norway on 19 August on the SS Stavangerfjord, the last ship {{to leave for}} the United States before the war began on 3 September. He began teaching at The New School, where he remained until May 1941, living first at 7502 Kessel Street, Forest Hills, Queens, where he conducted experiments on mice with cancer, injecting them with bions. He built a small <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage</b> to examine the vapors and lights he said the bions were producing. In October 1939 his secretary Gertrud Gaasland introduced him to Ilse Ollendorf, 29 years old at the time. Reich was still in love with Lindenberg, but Ollendorf started organizing his life for him, becoming his bookkeeper and laboratory assistant. They began living together in the Kessel Street house on Christmas Day 1939. She was eight weeks pregnant, but according to Turner he insisted that she have an abortion. Five years later, in 1944, they had a son, Peter, and were married in 1946.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} on static electricity, Faraday's ice pail {{experiment}} demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. This shielding effect is used {{in what is now}} known as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage.</b>|$|E
25|$|He was hit {{again in}} July 1969. Unusually, {{he was hit}} while in his truck, driving on a {{mountain}} road—the metal body of a vehicle normally protects people in cases such as this by acting as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage.</b> The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into the open window of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious and burned off his eyebrows and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a cliff edge.|$|E

50|$|<b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> are <b>Faraday</b> shields {{which have}} {{holes in the}} {{conductor}} and are more complex to analyze. Whereas continuous shields essentially attenuate all frequencies above the skin depth, the holes in a cage can permit higher frequencies to diffract through them or set up evanescent waves a short distance inside the surface. The higher the frequencies, the better they pass through a mesh of given size. Thus to work well at high frequencies {{the holes in the}} cage must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident EM wave, and <b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> may be thought of as band block devices.|$|R
25|$|Many guests {{visit the}} quiet stalls {{to use their}} mobile phones. For this reason, there were plans in 2005 to install a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage</b> around the toilets or to use Mobile phone jammers to prevent telephoning with those devices. Jamming devices are, however, illegal in Germany, and Faraday cages made of copper {{would have been too}} expensive, so these ambitious plans were dropped, and signs were placed instead, warning toilet users not to use {{cellular}} phones in the stalls. More recently, amplifying live music in the toilets has led to them no longer representing a quiet retreat for telephoning.|$|E
25|$|As the {{particle}} bunch {{passes through the}} tube it is unaffected (the tube acts as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage),</b> while {{the frequency of the}} driving signal and the spacing of the gaps between electrodes are designed so that the maximum voltage differential appears as {{the particle}} crosses the gap. This accelerates the particle, imparting energy to it in the form of increased velocity. At speeds near the speed of light, the incremental velocity increase will be small, with the energy appearing as an increase in the mass of the particles. In portions of the accelerator where this occurs, the tubular electrode lengths will be almost constant.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking chamber}} {{is similar to}} a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage</b> to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E
50|$|The {{connector}} {{operates in}} the frequency spectrum between 600 MHz to 5 GHz with shielded twisted pair and twinax cables. ARJ45 utilizes an internal system of <b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> to reduce cross talk to 35 dB or better at 5 GHz. Its performance up to 1000 MHz corresponds to category 7A connecting hardware.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} PET system prototype {{consists of}} 16 PET detector modules within <b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> in a 32 cm inner diameter ring pattern with small gaps between modules.

50|$|Because the Atari 400/800 8-bit {{computers}} {{included an}} RF modulator, stringent FCC regulations limiting radio emissions {{applied to the}} Ataris. Consequently, the Atari 400/800 systems internal construction used large metal frames as <b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> to prevent emissions. At this time most other computers used plug-in internal cards to add connections for peripherals. The Atari computers' internal structure made this impractical.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage,</b> are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{the beam}} {{is able to}} be {{minimized}} in other ways. On the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a <b>Faraday</b> <b>Cage),</b> which will intercept the microwaves. Other aircraft (balloons, ultralight, etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. The microwave beam intensity at ground level {{in the center of}} the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.|$|E
25|$|Many inventors {{lived in}} Salem. Moses Farmer {{was the first}} to light his home by {{electricity}} and sold his lightbulb to Thomas Edison. Edison also used his arc lighting in his demonstrations. Farmer provided Tesla with his lightbulbs for Westinghouse after Edison refused to sell them his to light the Columbian Exposition World Fair of 1893. Farmer would die at the fair. Charles Grafton Page made an electromagnet that could lift 1,000 pounds, electric train, an early telegraph, and worked in the US patent office. He was a precursor to what would befall Tesla for his laboratory had burned down during the Civil War and the section of the Smithsonian which housed his magnet also burned at a later date. Joseph Dixon the inventor of high temperature graphite crucibles, the Single Reflex Lens, and the Dixon-Ticonderoga #2 pencil lived in Salem. Packard Electric were making electric cars in the nineteenth century up to the 1914 fire which destroyed their factory. Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone in Salem and held the first public demonstration at the Salem Lyceum Hall. Also Nicola Tesla would create a power plant for Pequot Mills. He was in the area after Mark Twain introduced him to John Hammond Sr.. Tesla would give his son, John Hammond Jr. the patents for remote control which Hammond used to develop guided missiles and boats for the military during WWII. Tesla would conduct tests on ESP at Hammond Castle using a <b>Faraday</b> <b>Cage</b> to prove ESP did not transmit through electromagnetic waves, for a psychic received a message from a woman in the cage a few miles away. It was John Hammond Sr. who helped destroy Tesla's plans for free wireless electricity since he just invested heavily in a copper mine that was going to create electrical lines for transmission. Also Elihu Thomson had his Thomson-Houston Electric Company in the bordering town of Lynn and lived in the other border town Swampscott. This company will be merged with Edison Electric Company to make General Electric. Many of these Salem inventors' inventions are still displayed in the Smithsonian in the electricity display room.|$|E

50|$|Although {{it rarely}} happens, a glider can {{be struck by}} lightning. Metal {{sailplanes}} are <b>Faraday</b> <b>cages</b> and thus should not be destroyed by a lightning strike. However, gliders made of wood or fibreglass can be destroyed. Moreover, modern sailplanes are filled with electronic devices that can be damaged by lightning. Also, any winch launch must be prohibited when a thunderstorm is less than 20 km away. Indeed, the air is electrified, and the cable will act as a lightning rod.|$|R
500|$|The entire {{transmitter}} {{was surrounded}} by a [...] high clutter fence located [...] away from the antenna, which reflected the signal away from local objects on the ground that would otherwise create false returns. The ZAR was so powerful that the microwave energy at close range was far beyond the mandated safety limits and potentially lethal within [...] In order to allow for maintenance while the radar was operating, the equipment areas were shielded in a partial <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage</b> of metal foil, and a metal tunnel was run from the outside of the clutter fence, which blocked the signal outside the fence line. The other radars completing the system featured similar protection.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{was much}} {{encouraged}} by the meeting and hoped he would be invited to join Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. During their next meeting, he gave Einstein a small accumulator, {{and over the next}} 10 days Einstein performed experiments with it in his basement, which involved taking the temperature above, inside and near the device, and stripping it down to its <b>Faraday</b> <b>cage</b> to compare temperatures. He observed an increase of temperature, which Reich argued was caused by orgone. One of Einstein's assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling. Einstein concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room. [...] "Through these experiments I regard the matter as completely solved," [...] he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of lightning protection systems {{in use today}} are of the traditional Franklin design.
