Using patents developed by Science Dynamics Corporation, TelVue began providing cable companies with a method of processing their customers’ orders by telephone for individually viewed and billed Pay Per View (PPV) movies and events, {{without the need for}} a live operator or the technical requirement for a two-way <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the channel}} comes from the first five cent movie theaters called nickelodeons. Nickelodeon's history dates back to December 1, 1977, when Warner Cable Communications {{launched}} the first two-way <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>system,</b> QUBE, in Columbus, Ohio. Its C-3 cable channel carried Pinwheel daily from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Nickelodeon launched on April 1, 1979, initially distributed to Warner Cable systems via satellite on the RCA Satcom-1 transponder. Originally commercial-free, advertising was introduced in January 1984.|$|E
50|$|Elektra, {{along with}} its Nonesuch Records subsidiary, was {{acquired}} by Kinney National Services in 1970, which change its name to Warner Communications in 1972. Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with Asylum Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, David Geffen, would head the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed {{senior vice president and}} chief technologist for Warner — ushering the company into home video and the first <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>system.</b> Holzman also went on to acquire Discovery Records. In 1975, Geffen stepped down due to health problems. He would be replaced by Joe Smith, who later went on to become CEO of Capitol Records.|$|E

50|$|Even {{after the}} FCC {{repealed}} the minimum requirement, allowing stations carrying subscription television services to encrypt their signals for their entire broadcast day, WBTI continued to air The 700 Club at 10:00 a.m. on weekdays {{as well as}} a couple of religious programs on Sunday mornings outside of ONTV content. Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment expanded its <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>system</b> QUBE into the Cincinnati area in 1984; QUBE's 60-channel service, which provided a variety of programming from various local and cable-originated channels, made interest in ONTV slow to a halt. In January 1985, WBTI restored a general entertainment schedule, with ONTV programming being relegated to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. each weekday and from 5:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. ONTV ceased operations on June 1, 1985, at which time WBTI converted into a full-time general entertainment independent station as WIII.|$|E
50|$|While helping WCI win cable franchises in {{additional}} cities, Sherman {{was part of}} WCI's experimental QUBE system in Columbus, Ohio: the nation's first <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>system,</b> enabling QUBE customers to individually order film and other content direct from home on a pay-per-view basis. Sherman recognized its marketing and revenue potential for sports programming. He created cable's first sports subscription package with Ohio State University Chancellor Gordon Gee. To provide special content for its Pittsburgh system, Sherman negotiated the purchase of minority ownership of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He managed WCI's position and built a similar Pirates subscription package for WCI cable customers. In each WCI cable system, in big cities like Dallas and Chicago, Sherman continued to acquire college and professional sports rights, and then built regional sports networks to exhibit the games and specially created related programming. Eventually they were all purchased, and are known today as the Fox Sports Networks. Sherman positioned WCI's growing cable systems {{as an integral part}} of the sales and marketing of national pay-per-view events, especially high-priced championship fights. He negotiated special rights deals with impresarios and friends Don King and Bob Arum.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, with the introduction of cable television, the government initiated an experimental multi-channel and multi-purpose cable television service. In addition, Korea launched its first broadcasting/communication satellite, Mugungwha, to 36,000 km above the equator in 1995. The development of an integrated broadband network is expected to take the form of B-ISDN immediately {{after the turn of the}} century. This decade is a period of great technological change in the Korean broadcasting industry, which will make broadcasting media even more important than in the past. In this decade the Korean broadcasting industry will maximize the service with new technological developments such as DBS, satellites, and <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> <b>systems,</b> all of which will allow Korea to participate fully in the information society.|$|R

5000|$|Nickelodeon's history {{dates back}} to December 1, 1977, when QUBE, the first two-way major market <b>interactive</b> <b>cable</b> {{television}} <b>system</b> was launched in Columbus, Ohio by Warner Cable (owned by Warner Communications, now known as Time Warner, and predecessor to Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment). One of the ten [...] "community" [...] channels that were offered at no additional charge to QUBE subscribers was C-3, which exclusively carried Pinwheel each day from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The channel was developed by Dr. Vivian Horner, who worked as director {{of research on the}} PBS series The Electric Company and included Pinwheel (one of Nickelodeon's earliest series, which spun off from the C-3 service). Nickelodeon was originally used as a loss leader for then-parent company Warner Cable. As the company saw it, having a commercial-free children's channel would prove useful in franchising its <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> across the country, with that advantage putting them over rival companies such as HBO.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the third}} in a four part series of {{articles}} highlighting funding sources that help bridge the digital divide. The web site, The Digital Divide Network (1), highlights three primary categories of funding sources that can be accessed by those seeking to bridge the digital divide: funding from corporate sources, private sources, and government sources. In this column I will examine the AOL Time Warner Foundation (2), a corporate funding source that seeks to bridge the digital divide through, media, communications, and information technology.
