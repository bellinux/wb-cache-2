5000|$|By <b>executing</b> <b>commanders</b> {{guilty of}} retreating, Yan succeeded in {{improving}} the morale of his forces. During the Battle of Pingxingguan Shanxi troops successfully resisted numerous Japanese assaults while the Eighth Route Army harassed the Japanese from the rear and along their flanks. Other units of Yan's army successfully defended other nearby passes. After the Japanese successfully broke into the Taiyan Basin, they continued to encounter ferocious resistance. At Yuanping, a single brigade of Yan's troops held out against the entire Japanese advance for over a week, allowing reinforcements sent by the central government to take up defensive positions at Xinkou. The Communist generals Zhu De and Peng Dehuai criticized Yan for what they called [...] "suicidal tactics", but Yan was confident that the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese would eventually demoralize them, forcing them to abandon their effort to take Shanxi.|$|R
50|$|June 22, 1943, Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party {{received}} {{orders in}} Moscow to destroy Armia Krajowa in Belarus. Since then, {{the number of}} conflicts between Soviet and non-communist Polish partisans intensified. One Polish unit was arrested December 1, 1943, some Polish officers were <b>executed,</b> the <b>commander</b> major Wacław Pełka transported to Moscow.|$|R
50|$|Antigonus soon {{broke up}} the corps, finding it too {{turbulent}} to manage, also <b>executing</b> their <b>commander,</b> Antigenes. He sent them to Sibyrtius, the Macedonian satrap of Arachosia, with the order to dispatch them by small groups {{of two or three}} to dangerous missions, so that their numbers would rapidly dwindle. However, others may have been retired to live in Macedonian settlements in Asia.|$|R

50|$|On 3 March, rebels seized an {{artillery}} battalion in Jalma village near the Israeli Armistice line. Eight rebels {{were killed in}} the fighting, and SOHR stated that the rebels summarily <b>executed</b> the battalion <b>commander.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most of the Germans {{responsible}} for {{the operation of the}} camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and <b>executed.</b> Camp <b>commander</b> Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in West Germany and Austria, respectively, though Enge never served any time given his old age and poor health.|$|R
50|$|During {{the papacy}} of Pope John XVIII, the Copts were persecuted by the Ottoman rulers. The Jizya was {{increased}} to unprecedent amounts of money, {{and those who}} could not pay it had to convert to Islam or be <b>executed.</b> The <b>commander</b> of the Ottoman army stationed in Egypt seized the treasury of the Patriarchate and confiscated all its funds. Pope John XVIII had to go into hiding for some time.|$|R

50|$|All cockpit {{communication}} was strictly {{related to the}} flight and proper crew resource management was <b>executed.</b> The <b>commander</b> stated that he believed the aircraft had sufficiently low speed {{that it would have}} stopped had the runway been 50 to 100 m longer. The first officer estimated the speed at the overrun time at 5 to 10 km/h and that the aircraft would have stopped had the runway been 10 to 15 m longer.|$|R
25|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned, but {{before it could}} be <b>executed</b> the <b>commander</b> of the operation, Lieutenant-Colonel Splendorelli, was ambushed and killed between Bud Bud and Bula Barde. Italian morale hit rock bottom, and Hobyo seemed a lost cause as Omar stood poised to reconquer Hobyo itself. In an attempt to salvage the situation, {{governor}} De Vecchi requested two battalions from Eritrea and assumed personal command. The rebellion soon spilled over the borders into the Benadir and Western Somaliland, and Omar grew increasingly powerful.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{negotiation}} between Mayor of Kauswagan and Commander Tagoranao James Bond {{not to put}} himself to Justice but instead to submit and surrender the four (4) trigger men to MILF Lanao Del Norte.

50|$|Álzaga was arrested, {{tried and}} {{condemned}} to death {{along with other}} people. The executions started on July 4, two days after his arrest which raises the suspicion that the trial outcome was previously decided. More than 30 men were <b>executed,</b> including military <b>commanders,</b> merchants and clerics.|$|R
50|$|On 23 November the Partisans {{captured}} and <b>executed</b> several Chetnik <b>commanders</b> near Nova Varoš. This action compromised the Partisans {{in the eyes}} of many Serbs from Sjenica who developed animosity toward them. As a result, many Serbs from Sjenica joined forces of the town's militsiya to defend the town from the Partisans.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile the Missagiri {{campaign}} had bone badly. The army had been badly defeated there, and retreated in disarray. Furious, the king sent Yanda Pyissi, the younger son of Yazathingyan, {{to the front}} with an order to <b>execute</b> the <b>commander,</b> Thray Pyissapate. Yazathingyan {{was on his way}} back to Pagan, intercepted his son en route near Salin, and stopped him from carrying out the order. At Pagan, he presented the king with the rebel lord of Martaban and prisoners of war. When the king was in a better mood, he persuaded the king to rescind the execution order of Pyissapate.|$|R
50|$|Jalal ud din Firuz Khilji was {{accepted}} as sultan by a faction of Muslim amirs of Turkic, Persian, Arabic factions and Indian-Muslim aristocrats. However, Jalal-ud-din in his old age was unpopular and not universally accepted. During his six-year reign (1290-96), some of Balban's officers revolted due to his assumption {{of power and the}} subsequent sidelining of nobility and commanders serving the Mamluk dynasty. Jalal-ud-din suppressed the revolt and <b>executed</b> some <b>commanders,</b> then led an unsuccessful expedition against Ranthambhor and repelled a Mongol force {{on the banks of the}} Sind River in central India with the help of his nephew Juna Khan.|$|R
50|$|Choe-Yeong (or Choi-Yong) {{is named}} after General Choe Yong, Premier and Commander-in Chief {{of the armed forces}} during the 14th century Goryeo Dynasty. Choi Yong was greatly {{respected}} for his loyalty, patriotism, and humility.

50|$|On 13 May, ISIS {{reportedly}} {{gained control}} of at least five villages in the northern countryside of Raqqa province after battles with rebels; 14 rebel fighters were reported killed in the clashes. ISIS {{was said to have}} <b>executed</b> the military <b>commander</b> of the Raqqa rebel brigade and his nephew near Ayn Issa in Raqqa province.|$|R
5000|$|In Rampart, {{the player}} {{is in control}} {{of a set of}} castles, which they must defend, by {{alternately}} shooting at attacking ships (or other players), and repairing any damage done to them within a time limit. Surrounding this castle is a wall, made up of small blocks, completely surrounding a region of the board. This area is considered the player's territory, and it may contain one or more castles, and any number of cannons. The maintenance of this territory is the primary focus of the game. Once the player defeats the opponent, the player can <b>execute</b> the <b>commander,</b> by walking the plank or beheading. Music by: Jas C. Brooke, Mark Cooksey ...|$|R
25|$|Between 10 and 13 May, ISIL {{gained control}} of {{important}} parts of Eastern Deir ez-Zor province and districts of Deir ez-Zor city from rival rebel forces. and {{gained control of}} at least five villages in the northern countryside of Al-Raqqa province. ISIL also <b>executed</b> the military <b>commander</b> of the Al-Raqqa rebel brigade and his nephew near Ayn Issa in Al-Raqqa province.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1863, a Christian {{movement}} of [...] "big revivals" [...] developed among the Army of Tennessee, along {{with a great deal}} of dissension against Gen. Braxton Bragg. Bragg was a fairly good military strategist, but his personality was strongly detested by his commanders and ranks. Thus, his campaigns tended to be well planned, but poorly <b>executed</b> by his <b>commanders.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1004, the Khitans {{defeated}} the Chinese Song Dynasty and forced its emperor {{to pay tribute}} to the Khitan. With Song defeated, the only threat remaining against the Khitans was Goryeo. Also in 1009, General Gang Jo of Goryeo led a coup against the government; he deposed and murdered King Mokjong and began a military rule, and broke the peaceful relationship with the Khitans. The Khitans saw this as their reason to attack Goryeo, and in 1010, Emperor Shengzong of Liao led a massive invasion with a contingent of 400,000 soldiers, commanding the troops himself. Suffering heavy casualties in five major engagements, the Khitans finally {{defeated the}} Goryeo army and <b>executed</b> their <b>commander</b> General Gang Jo.|$|R
50|$|He was {{returned}} to rule in Iași upon {{the outbreak of the}} Austro-Turkish War, given his image as an enemy of the Habsburg Monarchy. When the Habsburg troops entered Moldavia, Racoviță suffered heavy losses, and called on help from the Nogai Tatars in Yedisan. Subsequently, he was able to defeat the infiltrating forces, and had the Habsburg <b>commander</b> <b>executed</b> together with those boyars who had risen against him.|$|R
50|$|In spring 926, Ma {{arrived in}} Chengdu. By that point, Li Jiji and Guo were making final {{preparations}} to depart Chengdu, when Ma delivered to Li Jiji Empress Liu's orders to kill Guo. Li Jiji hesitated, believing {{that it would}} be wrong to <b>execute</b> the <b>commander</b> of the army, particularly without an imperial edict. However, Li Congxi and the others argued to him that if the news leaked, all of them would be in danger. Li Jiji reluctantly agreed. He summoned Guo, ostensibly for a meeting, and when Guo arrived, had his guard Li Huan (李環) kill Guo with a hammer. Guo's sons Guo Tinghui and Guo Tingxin (郭廷信) were also killed. After Guo's death, Li Jiji departed Chengdu with the army.|$|R
50|$|To {{check the}} {{increasing}} {{power of the}} three brothers, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognised by the Mongol emperor Temür Khan as viceroy of Pagan on 20 March 1297. The brothers resented the new arrangement as a Mongol vassalage as it directly reduced their power. On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. The Mongols {{did not know about}} the dethronement until June-July 1298. In response, the Mongols launched another invasion, reaching Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government at Yunnan <b>executed</b> their <b>commanders</b> but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303.|$|R
5000|$|Renovated by a three months’ stay, {{occasionally}} in port, {{where they were}} strengthened by additional numbers, the undaunted remnants {{from time to time}} returned to their task; and in 1837, gave to the world a knowledge of those singular groups which heretofore “though within 150 miles of our coasts" [...] had been a mystery hidden within the dangers that environed them. The beautiful maps of the Red Sea, drafted by the late Commodore Carless, then a lieutenant, will ever remain permanent monuments of Indian Naval Science, and the daring of its officers and men. Those of the Maldive and Chagos groups, <b>executed</b> by <b>Commander</b> then Acting Lieutenant Felix Jones, were, we hear, of such a high order, that they were deemed worthy of special inspection by the Queen.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the siege}} of Misrata in May 2011, Amnesty International {{reported}} [...] "horrifying" [...] tactics such as [...] "indiscriminate attacks {{that have led to}} massive civilian casualties, including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents." [...] Gaddafi's military <b>commanders</b> also reportedly <b>executed</b> soldiers who refused to fire on protesters. The International Federation for Human Rights reported a case where 130 soldiers were executed. Some of the soldiers <b>executed</b> by their <b>commanders</b> were reportedly burned alive.|$|R
5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid <b>execute</b> field <b>commander</b> Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.|$|R
50|$|On 10 April, ISIS {{launched}} a three-pronged assault on rebel positions in {{and near the}} border town of Abu Kamal and reportedly took control of parts of the town. This {{marked the beginning of}} a two-month offensive that ended when, on 14 July, ISIS held all rebel-controlled neighborhoods in the provincial capital after expelling Nusra and other rebel groups. One day later, ISIS <b>executed</b> the rebel <b>commander</b> of al-Nusra in Deir ez-Zor. ISIS also wrested away all rebel-held towns and villages across the province, assuming control of between 95% and 98% of Deir Ez-Zor province.|$|R
5|$|Most of the Germans {{who were}} {{responsible}} for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Many of those who had been prominent German officials during the occupation of Serbia, including Turner, Fuchs and Meyszner, were extradited to Yugoslavia by the Allies after the war, where they were <b>executed.</b> Camp <b>commander</b> Andorfer managed to escape {{with the assistance of the}} Roman Catholic Church, which helped him flee to South America. He returned to Austria from Venezuela in the 1960s, and was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder—for which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy, Enge, was apprehended in the 1960s, and sentenced to one-and-a-half years imprisonment. His sentence was never carried out due to his old age and poor health. German guards suspected of executing Serbian prisoners were never tried, although they served as witnesses in several trials in West Germany.|$|R
50|$|On March 5, 1918, {{unaware of}} the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed only two days before, the unit {{commanded}} by Bułak-Bałachowicz got engaged in a skirmish against a German unit {{near the village of}} Smolova. Although the enemy unit was severely defeated, forced to retreat and abandon its staff behind, Bułak-Bałachowicz was seriously wounded after being shot in the left lung. Transported to Saint Petersburg, Bułak-Bałachowicz quickly recovered and rejoined with his brother, Józef Bułak-Bałachowicz. The latter got involved {{in the creation of a}} Polish cavalry detachment commanded by ensign Przysiecki. The Bolsheviks disbanded the unit soon after its formation, <b>executed</b> its <b>commander</b> and started to persecute its members. However, with a help of French military mission a Polish cavalry detachment was finally created and Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz became its commander. The new unit received Leon Trotsky's recognition and was soon reinforced with non-Polish volunteers from all over Russia and was planned as a cavalry division of the Red Army.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December 1297, {{the three}} {{brothers}} overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. At Pagan, Kyawswa's son Sawhnit was elected king by the dowager Queen Saw but {{soon became a}} governor {{under the authority of}} Myinsaing. Another of Kyawswa's sons, Kumara Kassapa, escaped to China. The Mongols did not know about the dethronement until June-July 1298. In 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinkhaya attacked the Mongol garrisons north of Mandalay named Nga Singu and Male. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in an army from Yunnan. The invasion force reached Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government at Yunnan <b>executed</b> their <b>commanders</b> but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303.|$|R
5000|$|The year 1576 {{marked the}} height of Ivan's campaign, and another 30,000 Russian forces crossed into Livonia in 1577. Magnus had fallen into disgrace when he {{defected}} from Ivan IV during the same year, and started to subordinate castles without consulting the tsar. When Kokenhusen (Koknese) submitted to Magnus {{in the hope of}} avoiding Ivan IV's army, the tsar sacked it and <b>executed</b> its German <b>commanders.</b> The campaign then focussed on Wenden (Cēsis, Võnnu), [...] "the heart of Livonia", which as the former capital of the Livonian Order was not only of strategic importance, but also a symbol for Livonia itself.|$|R
