Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that through tragedy something good will come.

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E
500|$|Of the {{remaining}} songs, Rachel and Finn's performance of [...] "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" [...] attracted praise for Monteith's vocals, which Stack and Yahr commented [...] "sounded better than ever". [...] "Le Jazz Hot!" [...] received a split response. Burns wrote that Kurt [...] "pulled it off flawlessly", and Fallon called the performance [...] "far more moving and rousing" [...] {{than any of}} the songs in [...] "Grilled Cheesus". Stack and Benigno both graded it [...] "B+"; the latter deemed it [...] "very good" [...] but [...] "not transcendent". Reiter felt that the costumes and choreography overpowered the emotion of the piece, and Futterman found the number [...] "too self-indulgent and reminiscent of previous performances like 'Rose's Turn'." [...] Berk rated it two stars out of five, and commented, [...] "I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> and the execution is commendable, but it still kind of sucked." [...] Rachel and Finn's deliberately offensive version of [...] "With You I'm Born Again" [...] received a [...] "C" [...] and [...] "C+" [...] from Benigno and Stack respectively. Both conceded that it was acceptable vocally, but as Stack acknowledged, [...] "the point of this song was to hate it, and I gotta say, Glee: you played me like a fiddle." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances. Regardless of being a send-up, Respers France found the number [...] "oddly endearing".|$|E

2500|$|The {{new head}} office was commended at the time. It {{featured}} in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads be any different from private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that we are here to do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E

2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
