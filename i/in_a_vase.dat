5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

25|$|This ritual {{assemblies}} lay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> {{that had}} a very anomalous shape to the Precucuteni style and were full of soil and straw. The cultic objects were put on display and worshiped during magic-religious ceremonies. The repeated use of them is proven {{by the presence of}} some chipping from wear. When not in motion, they were probably stored in this special container. The presence of soil under some statuettes kept in the vase, and the evidence of cariossids on the surface of two figurines and four stools, led some researchers to hypothesize that the pieces had been deposited in soil and straw for magical purposes: they had been left to bud.|$|E
25|$|Sunflowers (original title, in French: Tournesols) is {{the name}} of two series of still life {{paintings}} by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, executed a year later in Arles, shows a bouquet of sunflowers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vase.</b> In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit.|$|E

500|$|Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, {{including}} roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some {{reflect his}} {{interests in the}} language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles, and is of bouquets <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the [...] "texture of the seed-heads".|$|E
2500|$|The Gladiolus, plural Gladioli, {{was one of}} Van Gogh's {{favorite}} flower. [...] He especially enjoyed {{how they}} opened up like a fan after having been placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vase.</b> Because of their height, Van Gogh liked to use Gladioli to create triangular-structured compositions, such as Vase with Gladioli and Carnation (F237) or an inverted triangle as in Vase with Gladioli and China Asters (F248a).|$|E

2500|$|He was {{a gifted}} flower painter. [...] As {{in the work}} of other Antwerp {{painters}} of his generation such as Jan Brueghel the Younger and Philips de Marlier, some of the flower paintings of van den Hecke were dedicated to the presentation of a single variety of flowers: tulips and wallflowers. [...] Some of his flower still lifes, such as the Flowers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vase</b> with the Siege of Gravelingen (Kunsthistorisches Museum), include a view onto a landscape or a battle scene, two genres in which van Hecke was skilled.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} he said, [...] "People ask why I don't paint flowers, butterflies and landscapes? I {{tell them that}} I seek the truth and I am after reality.

What inspires me is a person who has gone hungry for hours and is struggling for survival.
