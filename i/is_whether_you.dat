2500|$|On November 6, 2007, Pickens {{offered a}} million dollars to anyone able to dispute any claims made in {{political}} ads by the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth (SVPT), a group he had supported during the 2004 presidential election. John Kerry, whose military record and anti-war activism during Vietnam was the target of the group's book and media campaign, sent Pickens a letter on November16, 2007, accepting the challenge, requesting that Pickens donate the money to the Paralyzed Veterans of America should he succeed in disproving any of the SVPT claims. In response to Kerry's acceptance of the challenge, Pickens issued a letter the same day, narrowing the original challenge to the SVPT ads, and requiring Kerry to provide his Vietnam journal, all of his military records, specifically those covering the years after his active duty service, and copies of all movies and tapes made during his service. Pickens' letter also challenged Kerry to agree to donate $1 million to the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, if Kerry [...] "cannot prove anything in the Swift Boat ads to be untrue." [...] Kerry later accused Pickens of [...] "parsing and backtracking" [...] on his initial offer and wrote that [...] "I am prepared to prove the lie and marshal all the evidence, the question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are prepared to fulfill your obligation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is," [...] said he, speaking {{between his}} teeth, and hardly pronouncing his words, [...] "the question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> care for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you know}} our object without our telling it, the only {{question}} that remains <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{have the power to}} relieve my sister's anxiety?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This is a {{job where}} … <b>you</b> have to <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> like it or not, a certain member of the space family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, what {{we wanted}} to ask <b>you</b> specially, Johnson, <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> can tell us what the {{servants}} at the Hall thought about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I shall," [...] said he. [...] "I am like that. I {{will fight}} to save you, from {{yourself}} if need <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> forgive me or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you will. You {{are just}} the sort of man who will succeed with the House. What I doubt <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will do as well in office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't the point, Celia, and {{you know}} it. The point <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> believe the chances are for or against her in such a marriage. Do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've power {{enough for}} {{anything}} in the world," [...] said the Waters. [...] "The only question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> could stand the strain if we came down on you full head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can {{you know}} of it?" [...] he muttered thickly. [...] "It is not for such as you.... What I meant to ask <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{believed}} in the efficacy of remorse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not, Mr. Coulson," [...] he answered. [...] "At any rate, my {{question}} {{had nothing to}} do with your other very interesting avocation. What I wanted to ask <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> could tell me anything about a compatriot of yours--a Mr. Hamilton Fynes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not, indeed!" [...] {{the page}} exclaimed. [...] "Who {{would have thought}} of seeing you dressed as a sailor boy? The prince will be glad to see you; for the first {{question}} he asked when he crossed the threshold this afternoon <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> had returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir," [...] said Sir James, impatiently, [...] "that {{is neither}} here nor there. The {{question}} <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> don't see {{with me the}} propriety of sending young Ladislaw away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir; I hope my mode of {{life may}} not require it; {{but that is}} not exactly to the point: what I wish to know <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will speak to Mr. Robarts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is our business. The {{question}} for you to decide, and to decide immediately, <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are ready to end this, in some respects, constrained situation, and give your word to place that document in our hands." ...|$|E
60|$|VENABLES. We {{know that}} a {{division}} on your Bill can have no serious significance; we shall see to that. And so the test <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> had the pluck to divide the House. Had you been intending to talk big in this speech, and then hedge, through fear of the Government, {{they would have had}} no further use for you.|$|R
50|$|If in this Case {{there be}} no other (as the Proverb is) then Hobson's choice...which <b>is,</b> chuse <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will have this or none.|$|R
5000|$|Do {{not care}} {{if there is}} a purpose to your life on Earth. If there is, it will <b>be</b> {{fulfilled}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> care or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{appeal to}} me, Mr Lynch," [...] said Lord Ballindine, [...] "and I must say I most firmly believe {{you to be}} guilty. My only doubt <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> should not at once be {{committed}} for trial at the next assizes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] she objected. [...] "We are both of us much too serious. The only {{question}} we are considering <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> would object to my dining with Mr. Borden and lunching with Mr. Hyde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That can be {{done only}} in the proper manner. The {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> have any witnesses to prove that this boy was not really fighting, {{and that he had}} sufficient provocation to excuse his trying to thrash the other one." ...|$|E
60|$|Farewell, Monsieur du Miroir. Of you, perhaps, as of many men, it may <b>be</b> doubted <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the wiser, {{though your}} whole {{business}} is REFLECTION.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{thinking}} of your duty; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> thinking <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> can bring yourself {{to make a}} clean breast of it, and break the promises which you have made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What could I say? Of course I said I did not know. I {{suppose he}} <b>was</b> meditating <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> would live here {{and ask him}} to dinner on Sundays!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only {{difficulty}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> can see. But we must try. You've set me whirling round, {{but we must}} go step by step. Oh, but it's all in your germ!"--I {{kept that}} up. [...] "If she isn't now beastly unhappy----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not particularly," [...] said Sir Henry. [...] "Of course one can't get a {{house in}} London for nothing. I shall have rather a bargain of that if I can pay the money down. The great thing <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good many}} people know of it; and such things are hard to keep. It may come out--some rumor of it--in the morning papers. The {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> want to stay till they know it here; {{whether it would be}} wise, or useful." ...|$|E
5000|$|U.S. Attorney Ortiz {{asserted}} {{after the}} 2011 indictment that [...] "stealing <b>is</b> stealing, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{use a computer}} command or a crowbar, and <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> sell what you have stolen or give it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your worship {{should know}} better than I,' said Dick Gardener; 'nevertheless, I have a notion you are going where all you Scotsmen should <b>be</b> sent, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will or no.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>was</b> {{wondering}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> would lend {{her to me}} for to-morrow night,” said Clovis, {{with the}} careless solicitude of one who borrows a collar stud or a tennis racquet.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father and}} mother, I mean," [...] I {{explained}} in some confusion, [...] "were just of the com--of the ordinary size. And what I was wondering <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> yourself would be sorry--in quite a general way, of course--if you found your practice going down like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact of your knowing or {{not knowing}} makes no difference," [...] the Prince answered. [...] "You {{are no longer}} a free agent. The only {{question}} for you to decide <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> remain here willingly or whether you will force me to remind you of our bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now the {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will join me?" [...] {{he said in}} conclusion. [...] "Having studied the matter so long I feel warranted in {{saying that it is}} not an unusually dangerous venture, and, if we are successful, the amount of wealth we can carry away must be enormous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{generally}} {{avoid any}} discussions of that kind. They never lead to anything," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>was</b> wondering <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> {{could learn to}} like London as well as Montreal?" ...|$|R
50|$|Others {{take the}} view that in {{invariance}} mechanics it should <b>be</b> irrelevant <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> view the fundamental constituents as particles or strings or membranes and a more formal approach is called for.|$|R
6000|$|The {{man made}} a little rueful gesture. [...] "I don't know. Chop trees again for some rancher, most probably--in fact, I <b>was</b> {{wondering}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> would have me back as a ranch-hand." ...|$|R
