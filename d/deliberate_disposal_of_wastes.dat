Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate {{at the center of}} gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. <b>Deliberate</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.|$|E
5000|$|The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping <b>of</b> <b>Wastes</b> and Other Matter 1972, {{commonly}} called the [...] "London Convention" [...] or [...] "LC '72" [...] and also abbreviated as Marine Dumping, is {{an agreement to}} control pollution of the sea by dumping and to encourage regional agreements supplementary to the Convention. It covers the <b>deliberate</b> <b>disposal</b> at sea <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the Convention. It entered into force in 1975. As of September 2016, there were 89 Parties to the Convention.|$|R

In the study, I have investigated the following in order to demonstrate conditions for promoting appropriate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition. 1) The interview for grasping the actual conditions <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition and exhibition hall, 2) The investigation of the sense of the people concerned in an Exhibition to present their basic attitude and specific method for <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> 3) The investigation into the actual conditions of an Exhibition in Asian Nations to demonstrate the relation between <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and institution or social condition because the view and method <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> differ from each country. As a result, I could obtain the following; 1) A related contractor are actually concerned in <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> consider more seriously than the organizer and exhibitor, 2) more people realize that <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> is the serious problem in the exhibiting world, 3) drawing out the flow <b>of</b> discharge from <b>waste</b> in an Exhibition to grasp roughly the whole waste, 4) the necessity of estimating the quantity <b>of</b> discharge from <b>waste</b> based on the investigation into the actual conditions, 5) the difference between Asian Nations and Japan in <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Key words: exhibition, booth display, waste assessment 1...|$|R

Inasmuch as they contain all of the excretions {{of the body and}} also garbage and refuse, and inasmuch as they may contain infections material, the safe and proper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> is one <b>of</b> the first necessities of hygienic living.
