40|$|Needle-free liquid <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> {{were invented}} > 50 {{years ago for}} the {{delivery}} of proteins and vaccines. Despite their long history, needle-free liquid <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> are not commonly used {{as a result of}} frequent pain and bruising. We hypothesized that pain and bruising originate from the deep penetration of the jets and can potentially be addressed by minimizing the penetration depth of jets into the skin. However, current <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> are not designed to maintain shallow dermal penetration depths. Using a new strategy of jet injection, pulsed microjets, we report on delivery of protein drugs into the skin without deep penetration. The high velocity (v > 100 m/s) of microjets allows their entry into the skin, whereas the small jet diameters (50 – 100 μm) and extremely small volumes (2 – 15 nanoliters) limit the penetration depth (≈ 200 μm). In vitro experiments confirmed quantitative delivery of molecules into human skin and in vivo experiments with rats confirmed the ability of pulsed microjets to deliver therapeutic doses of insulin across the skin. Pulsed microjet injectors could be used to deliver drugs for local as well as systemic applications without using needles...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} and compare seven types of injection devices for their risks of iatrogenic transmission of bloodborne pathogens and their economic costs in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Risk assumptions for each device and cost models were constructed {{to estimate the}} number of new hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections resulting from patient-to-patient, patient-to-health care worker, and patient-to-community transmission. Costs of device purchase and usage were derived from the literature, while costs of direct medical care and lost productivity from HBV and HIV disease were based on data collected in 1999 in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Uganda. Multivariate sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation characterized uncertainties in model parameters. Costs were summed from both the societal and health care system payer's perspectives. FINDINGS: Resterilizable and disposable needles and syringes had the highest overall costs for device purchase, usage, and iatrogenic disease: median US dollars 26. 77 and US dollars 25. 29, respectively, per injection from the societal perspective. Disposable-cartridge <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> and automatic needle-shielding syringes had the lowest costs, US dollars 0. 36 and US dollars 0. 80, respectively. Reusable-nozzle <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> and auto-disable needle and syringes were intermediate, at US dollars 0. 80 and US dollars 0. 91, respectively, per injection. CONCLUSION: Despite their nominal purchase and usage costs, conventional needles and syringes carry a hidden but huge burden of iatrogenic disease. Alternative injection devices for the millions of injections administered annually in sub-Saharan Africa would be of value and should be considered by policy-makers in procurement decisions...|$|R
50|$|The hypospray has a {{real world}} {{counterpart}} called a <b>jet</b> <b>injector,</b> invented four years before the first Star Trek series debuted. It uses compressed air to inject the medication through the skin. However, unlike the hypospray, it carries the risk of cross-contamination, {{which has led to}} the <b>jet</b> <b>injector</b> falling into disuse. It also has limits for adjusting and controlling the exact dosage levels. The mechanisms used, particularly in spring-loaded designs, are one shot releases, with a coil that ejects the same amount of drug to the same depth every time, which limits the application to certain drugs or patient populations.|$|E

40|$|In a {{joint effort}} between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the NASA Lewis Research Center, a new {{technology}} was demonstrated to identify and control rotating stall and surge in a single-stage, high-speed compressor. Through the use of highvelocity, high-frequency <b>jet</b> <b>injectors,</b> the instabilities of surge and stall were controlled in a high-speed compressor rig. Through the use of active stall control, modal instabilities that normally occur in the pressure measurements prior to stall were normalized {{and the range of}} the compressor was extended. Normally the events of rotating stall and surge instabilities limit the operation of the aeroengine compressor to a region below the surge line. To enhance the performance of the compressor, the Lewis/MIT team used active stall control methods to extend the normal operation of the compressor beyond the original stall point...|$|R
40|$|Transdermal {{delivery}} of peptides and proteins avoids the disadvantages {{associated with the}} invasive parenteral route of administration and other alternative routes such as the pulmonary and nasal routes. Since proteins have a large size and are hydrophilic in nature, they cannot permeate passively across the skin due to the stratum corneum which allows the transport of only small lipophilic drug molecules. Enhancement techniques such as chemical enhancers, iontophoresis, microneedles, electroporation, sonophoresis, thermal ablation, laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation and noninvasive <b>jet</b> <b>injectors</b> aid in the {{delivery of}} proteins by overcoming the skin barrier in different ways. In this review, these enhancement techniques that can enable the transdermal delivery of proteins are discussed, including a discussion of mechanisms, sterility requirements, and commercial development of products. Combination of enhancement techniques may result in a synergistic effect allowing increased protein delivery and these are also discussed...|$|R
