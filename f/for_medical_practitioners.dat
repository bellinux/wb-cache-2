2500|$|In the {{countries}} that award bachelor's degrees in medicine, however, Doctor of Medicine denotes a holder of a higher doctorate and is reserved <b>for</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> who undertake research and submit a thesis {{in the field of}} medicine. Nevertheless, those holding Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually referred to by the courtesy title of [...] "Doctor" [...] and use the prefix [...] "Dr.", whether or not they also hold a PhD or DSc. In theory the right {{to the use of the}} title [...] "Doctor" [...] is conferred on the medical graduate when he or she is registered as a medical practitioner by the relevant professional body, not by the possession of the MBBS degrees. The reason is found in a parallel tradition for those who are post-graduate specialists in Surgery; on acceptance into a College of Surgeons, they stop styling themselves [...] "Doctor" [...] and revert to [...] "Mister" [...] (Mr), [...] "Miss", [...] "Muz" [...] (Ms.) or [...] "Missus" [...] (Mrs). This curious situation, where an elevation in professional rank is signified by dropping the title of Doctor, came about because historically a [...] "surgeon" [...] was an ordinary worker, usually a barber, not trained in medicine but performing dissections and surgery under the direction of a gowned academic who was the actual [...] "doctor".|$|E
