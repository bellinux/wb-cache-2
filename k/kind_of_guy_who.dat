He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually very exciting, and I'm super thrilled with the way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E

Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful.
