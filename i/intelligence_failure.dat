5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure</b> and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

These positions disclosed themselves by firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and {{the barbed wire}} obstacles.

British Intelligence estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure.</b> The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E

25|$|The {{captured}} British {{ships were}} brought to Cádiz, which was an unusual spectacle since the capture of such a great enemy convoy by any navy was an uncommon event; de Córdova's fleet did this on two occasions. All the ships, including the five East Indiaman, were incorporated into the Spanish navy. This was a major <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure,</b> for the British Admiralty did not learn of the capture of the British convoy until 4 August, and neither did Geary nor Captain John Moutray.|$|E

25|$|In 2015 through 2016 the Foreign Affairs Select Committee {{conducted}} an extensive and highly critical {{inquiry into the}} British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure.</b> By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya {{and the growth of}} ISIL in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, after independence, Sanjeevi Pillai {{took over}} as the first Indian Director of the IB. Having been {{depleted}} of trained manpower by the exit of the British, Pillai tried to run the bureau on MI5 lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence operation, but the Indian debacle in the Sino-Indian war of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. Foreign <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure</b> during the 1962 Sino-Indian War led then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to order a dedicated foreign intelligence agency to be established. After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, Indian Chief of Army Staff General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri also called for more intelligence-gathering. Around the end of 1966 {{the concept of a}} separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape.|$|E
25|$|As rivalries {{continued}} to exist between military and civil authorities, the military intelligence service did not completely fall under the sway of the Sûreté, but it was strongly influenced by the institutionalised cooperation and the Sûreté's style of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial politics: it also benefited from an improved flow of information between the two intelligence agencies. Whether the institutionalised sharing of intelligence and enhanced understanding of anti-colonial organisations would lead to more effective prevention, depended largely on the internal operations of the military intelligence service. The mutiny had exposed flaws in the local and central SRM, the result of both personal and institutional deficiencies. Commandant Le Tacon, who had been responsible for organising the local SRM, {{had been unable to}} understand the graveness of the predicament despite several warnings. The central SRM may have prevented the mutiny if the officer responsible for Yen Bai, Slouchez, had informed his local contact, Tran Uc Sinh, about his leave of absence or if he had taken the required precautions of arranging cover during his absence. These oversights were particular to Yen Bai, whereas planned VNQDD mutinies in many other garrisons, such as Kien An, Phu Lang Thuong, Nam Dinh and Sept-Pagodes, were prevented at the last moment. The <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure</b> at Yen Bai did not reflect weaknesses in the overall organisational hierarchy of the SRM, or failures in the decentralisation measures which had started in early 1929 but which had not yet been finished.|$|E

500|$|In January 2010, ICTS International, a {{security}} firm that provides security services to Schiphol airport, and G4S (Group 4 Securicor Aviation Security B.V.), another security firm, traded blame over the security oversight, as did authorities at Schiphol Airport, the Federal Aviation Authority, and U.S. intelligence officials. [...] According to Haaretz, the failure was twofold: An <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure,</b> as Obama stated, {{in the poor}} handling of information that arrived at the State Department and probably also the CIA from both {{the father of the}} would-be bomber and the British security service; and a failure within the security system, including that of ICTS.|$|E
500|$|For the USAF, {{the loss}} at Phou Pha Thi {{was not a}} result of <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure,</b> {{because it had been}} {{provided}} with accurate information from the very start. Instead, it was clearly a failure of command and control, as the U.S. personnel and their Hmong allies were not permitted to freely organize their own defense to hold the radar facility. The Battle of Lima Site 85 resulted in the largest ground combat loss of USAF personnel during the Vietnam War. A total of 12 U.S. personnel were missing or killed in the fighting on Phou Pha Thi; 11 were killed or missing on the ground and one was shot dead during the evacuation. [...] In addition a USAF officer searching for survivors was shot down and killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and {{there had to be a}} reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure</b> had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E

40|$|Intelligence, like warfare, is not {{a science}} but an art. If a science at all, it is {{certainly}} far from an exact science. It is an intellectual endeavour which requires much training, common sense, experience, team work, technological expertise {{and the ability to}} communicate the product to the user, to name {{but a few of the}} basic requirements. It also requires intellectual bravery to give the result of the intelligence assessments to the user, without the tendency to be vague, so as to excuse faulty intelligence predictions in the future. It remains a human endeavour prone to mistakes. <b>Intelligence</b> <b>failures</b> are thus to be expected, but good tradecraft, and above all sound analysis, can lead to success.

500|$|The same day, Deutch {{publicly}} criticized six former, and one serving, CIA {{officers for}} the [...] "devastating" [...] <b>intelligence</b> <b>failure,</b> {{although he did}} not hold three of his predecessors accountable. He stated that would create an independent, National Intelligence Council-managed Customer Review Process for agent reporting, and said that he had already installed new management, stressed counterintelligence at the CIA, and established new accountability boards, among other reforms. Deutch added that if the 12 CIA officers cited in Hitz's report were still employed, he would have fired two of them. He said that he had reprimanded the only officer still at the Agency, that the two officers he would have fired were [...] "banned from future employment with the Agency," [...] and that four others had been reprimanded or warned. Deutch insisted that efforts to improve counterintelligence would prevent a recurrence of the Ames [...] "catastrophe," [...] and provided the FBI with the damage assessment report so the Bureau could assist in subsequent investigations.|$|E
