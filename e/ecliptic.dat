5|$|<b>Ecliptic</b> {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the <b>ecliptic,</b> and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the <b>ecliptic,</b> moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|Obliquity of the <b>ecliptic</b> is {{the term}} used by astronomers for the {{inclination}} of Earth's equator {{with respect to the}} <b>ecliptic,</b> or of Earth's rotation axis to a perpendicular to the <b>ecliptic.</b> It is about 23.4° and is currently decreasing 0.013 degrees (47 arcseconds) per hundred years due to planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} <b>ecliptic</b> {{longitude}} and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} <b>ecliptic.</b> Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the <b>ecliptic</b> from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the <b>ecliptic,</b> to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the <b>ecliptic,</b> the <b>ecliptic</b> itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north <b>ecliptic</b> pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for <b>ecliptic</b> coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ecliptic</b> forms {{one of the}} two {{fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the celestial equator. Perpendicular to the <b>ecliptic</b> are the <b>ecliptic</b> poles, the north <b>ecliptic</b> pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the {{two fundamental}} planes, the <b>ecliptic</b> is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the celestial equator.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the <b>ecliptic</b> plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the <b>ecliptic.</b> If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the <b>ecliptic</b> at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the <b>ecliptic,</b> crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the <b>ecliptic</b> on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the <b>ecliptic</b> and the Sun is always very near the <b>ecliptic,</b> eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The <b>ecliptic</b> is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's <b>ecliptic</b> comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that <b>ecliptic</b> comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was reported}} at 12.44° declination and 17.163 hours right ascension, and at an <b>ecliptic</b> latitude of 34.9° (the <b>ecliptic</b> latitude changes very slowly), {{placing it in}} the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth on May 21, 2011.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called <b>ecliptic</b> comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly {{isotropic}} comets). <b>Ecliptic</b> comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the <b>ecliptic</b> plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|A curious {{aspect of}} the {{official}} design {{is the absence of}} a segment of the Tropic of Capricorn, between the national shield and the <b>ecliptic</b> arc.|$|E
5|$|Because of the precessional {{motion of}} the equinox, the <b>ecliptic</b> {{coordinates}} of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing. Specifying a position in <b>ecliptic</b> coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to {{the direction of the}} equinox at that date. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and <b>ecliptic</b> of date. This specifies the mean equinox of 4 Jan 2010 0h TT as above, without the addition of nutation.|$|E
5|$|In {{ancient times}} the signs corresponded roughly to 12 of the constellations that {{straddle}} the <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near {{the plane of the}} <b>ecliptic,</b> some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the <b>ecliptic</b> plane.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the <b>ecliptic.</b> The planets {{are very close to}} the <b>ecliptic,</b> whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the <b>ecliptic,</b> is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the <b>ecliptic</b> in the sky. The <b>ecliptic</b> is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the <b>ecliptic</b> is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the <b>ecliptic).</b> Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>ecliptic</b> is the {{circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the <b>ecliptic</b> also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the <b>ecliptic</b> is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the <b>ecliptic</b> and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E
5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the <b>ecliptic</b> with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the <b>ecliptic</b> itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the <b>ecliptic,</b> known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the <b>ecliptic.</b> This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the <b>ecliptic,</b> they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation Taurus during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and <b>ecliptic.</b> A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E
5|$|With {{a visual}} {{magnitude}} of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest {{object in the}} Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane, called the <b>ecliptic.</b> As the region of sky close to the <b>ecliptic</b> became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, {{as well as more}} distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the <b>ecliptic</b> plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the <b>ecliptic</b> by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the <b>ecliptic</b> (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the <b>ecliptic</b> at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards <b>ecliptic</b> coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the <b>Ecliptic</b> J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E
5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the <b>ecliptic.</b> In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the <b>ecliptic</b> (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} {{suggested by}} the Deep <b>Ecliptic</b> Survey team introduces a formal distinction between scattered-near objects (which could be scattered by Neptune) and scattered-extended objects (e.g. 90377 Sedna) using a Tisserand's parameter value of 3.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ecliptic</b> is not {{normally}} noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, carrying the observer through {{the cycles of}} sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion {{against the background of}} fixed stars.|$|E
5|$|The great circles {{represent}} the <b>ecliptic</b> (wider oblique arc), the equator, and two meridians. These last three are positioned {{so that the}} intersections between each two arcs make a right angle; one meridian lies on the flag's plane while the other is perpendicular to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Pallas was {{determined}} by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years {{was similar to the}} period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to the plane of the <b>ecliptic.</b>|$|E
5|$|A scheme {{introduced}} by a 2005 {{report from the}} Deep <b>Ecliptic</b> Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E
5|$|Detached objects {{have also}} been {{referred}} to in the scientific literature as extended scattered disc objects (E-SDO), distant detached objects (DDO), or scattered–extended, as in the formal classification by the Deep <b>Ecliptic</b> Survey. This reflects the dynamical gradation that can exist between the orbital parameters of the scattered disk and the detached population.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the <b>ecliptic,</b> the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt {{the temple}} of Amun-Re at Karnak {{has been the subject}} of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the {{obliquity}} of the <b>ecliptic</b> show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun. The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the <b>ecliptic</b> is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the <b>ecliptic</b> to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the <b>ecliptic</b> plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the <b>ecliptic</b> pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the <b>ecliptic</b> making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E
