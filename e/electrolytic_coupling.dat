40|$|In the {{introduction}} to this Thesis recent progress in the biogenesis of triterpenes is discussed with particular reference to the dammarene diols (XI a and b). This example is also taken to illustrate the techniques now used in the elucidation and determination of such complex structures. There follows {{a survey of the}} methods used in the total synthesis of pentacyclic triterpenes. Because of difficulties presented by both the structure and the stereochemistry of such molecules the approaches have necessarily been limited to three main courses of attack, the acid-catalysed cyclisation of aqualene (XII), the combination of two decalin derivatives to provide rings AB and DE of the pentacyclic system, and the combination of a of a tricyclic ABC moiety with a monocyclic unit to provide ring E. The main body of this Thesis is divided into two sections (A and B). In the first a detailed investigation la made into a previously reported route from elemadienolic acid (I) to a possible ABC tricyclic intermediate (I→IX) with particular emphasis being placed on yields and reproducibility. It is shown that the route has several undesirable features and a superior alternative is offered (X→XI→IX). In connection with this work two potential monocyclic ring E precursors have been synthesised (XIIIa and XIVa) and an attempted <b>electrolytic</b> <b>coupling</b> of (XIIIa) and (IX) has been carried out. The second section represents a continuation of the work of Littlehailes and is devoted to the synthesis of a hydroxylated bicyclic AB unit (XV) which could be utilised in alkylating the decalone (XVI) with the aim of constructing a pentacyclic triterpene of the amyrin series. Section A. The tricyclic intermediate (IX) was first isolated by the route illustrated (I→IX) in quantities sufficient for little more than characterisation purposes. More recently Ryback has made a preliminary investigation into the practical utilisation of such a route with special regard to the isolation of (IX) in large enough quantities for use in further synthetic operations. However his results were not conclusive and it was decided to reinvestigate some of the operations involved. As supplies of tirucallenediol (II) were at hand it was decided to look first at its conversion into isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa). It was found that although diacetylation went in high yield, the yield from the semi-hydrolysis of the diacetate (III) was not reproducible and was often poor necessitating a laborious fractional recrystallisation and recycling procedure in order to obtain quantities of the monoacetate (IV). The formation of the methanesulphonyl derivative (V), its reduction with lithium aluminium hydride to give tirucallenyl acetate (VI) and the subsequent acid isomerisation to isutirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) all went in high yield. Oxidation of (VIIa) with t -butyl chromate gave a reproducible 50 % conversion to the αβ-unsaturated ketone (VIIIa). The cleavage of the &Delta 13 (17) double bond in the unsaturated ketone (VIIIa) was attempted by ozonolysis, osmium tetroxide and lead tetraacetate, alkaline peroxide and the Lemieux periodate/permanganate oxidation. Only ozone caused fission to occur giving the tricyclic keto acid (IX) in poor yield. A summary of the results of these experiments and a discussion of the implications is presented. The demonstration that at least two stages in this route were unsatisfactory, the difficulty of isolating elemadienonic acid (XVII) in a high degree of purity, and the many stages involved in the conversion of elemadienolic acid (I) to the tricyclic intermediate (IX), instigated the search for an alternative source of (IX). This was afforded by the isolation of the epimeric mixture of dammarene diols (XI a and b) and the related ketones (X a and b) from Dammar resin. Reduction of the ketone content of the mixture to alcohol by lithium aluminium hydride followed by acetylation, hydrogenation and acid-catalysed dehydration gave a further mixture which contained isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) and isocuphenyl acetate (VIIb). Oxidation of this mixture with t -butyl chromate followed by ozonolysis of the resultant αβ-unsaturated ketones (VIII a and b) gave the tricyclic intermediate (IX), in the manner already described for isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) alone. The tricyclic intermediate (IX) could now be effectively and efficiently isolated from a natural source as the end product of a route containing only four major operations. Two cyclohexane keto-esters (XIIIb) and (XIVb) were synthesised for the purpose of coupling with the tricyclic intermediate (IX). Each was derived from dimedone. In one case, dimedone was converted into the enol-chloride (XVIII) which was hydrogenated to the cyclohexanone (XIX), and carbethoxylated to give the keto-ester (XIVb). In the second case, dimedone was alkylated first with methyl iodide and then ethyl bromoacetate to give (XXI). Eliminating one of the ketone groups via the thioketal and reduction with Raney nickel gave the keto-ester (XIIIb). It was attempted to electrolytically couple the tricyclic intermediate (IX) with the monocyclic keto-acid (XIIIa) but only the bis -cyclohexyl ethane derivative (XXII) could be isolated. Both isotirucallenyl acetate (VIIa) and isoeuphenyl acetate (VIIb) were converted into the 1, 5 -diketones (XXIIIa) and (XXIIIb) in good yields with osmium tetroxide and lead tetraacetate. Attempts to recyclise the 1, 5 -diketones by a pinacolic reduction succeeded, albeit in poor yield, when the forcing conditions of molten sodium in xylene were employed. An attempted Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the 1, 5 -diketone (XXIIIa), however, was unsuccessful. In anticipation of the products to be obtained from the coupling of the monocyclic and tricyclic intermediates (XIIIa) and (IX) attempts were made to hydroxylate and fission the Δ 13 (18) double bond in δ-amyrin acetate (XXIV), but these proved unsuccessful. The δ-amyrin acetate (XXIV) was obtained from β-amyrin (XXVa) by successive acetylation, selenium dioxide dehydrogenation and partial re-hydrogenation. β-Amyrin (XXVa) was itself isolated as its benzoate from the fractional crystallisation of a mixture of &alpha- and β-amyrin benzoates, (XXVI) and (XXVb). Also included in this section is a discussion of further methods of converting the tricyclic intermediate (IX) into a pentacyclic triterpene. Section B. The base catalysed condensation of ethyl 2 -oxo- 3 -carbethoxy-butyrate and ethyl vinyl ketone gave the 1, 3 -diketone (XXVIII), which after acid-catalysed cyclisation and esterification gave the αβ-unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) in high overall yield. As difficulties were both anticipated and realised in the alkylation of (XXIX), a second monocyclic keto-ester (XXX) was synthesised in order to make comparative studies of their alkylation. The keto-ester (XXX) was synthesised in high yield via the base-catalysed condensation of ethyl α-methyl-β-oxoadipate and methyl vinyl ketone, ring-closure and esterification. Unsuccessful attempts were made to convert the unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) into a bicyclic precursor (XL) for rings A and B by a Robinson ring extension and by a Michael addition with acrylonitrile. However, the discovery (see below) that the substance (XXIX) could be alkylated suggested that the same result might be indirectly achieved by alkylating it with a β-halobutan- 3 -one ketal and then splitting the ketal and cyclising the resultant 1, 5 -diketone. With the object of preparing a β-halobutan- 3 -one ketal several vain attempts were made to add methanol in the presence of mercuric chloride/boron trifluoride etherate catalyst to several related ω-substituted but- 1 -ynes (XXXI a, b and c). Finally the object was realised by converting ethyl acetoacetate into its ketal derivative (XXXIIa), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to the ketal alcohol (XXXIIb), this in turn giving the toluene- p -sulphonate (XXXIIc) and iodide (XXXIId). A wide variety of conditions were employed in attempts to alkylate the monocyclic keto-esters (XXIX and XXX) with both the β-ketal toluene- p -sulphonate (XXXIIc) and iodie (XXXIId) but as no alkylated product was ever isolated it appeared that the β-ketal detivatives (XXXIIc) and (XXXIId) were either too unstable or too inactive to accomplish substitution. However, the monocyclic intermediates (XXIX) and (XXX) were alkylated in several ways. The unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) was alkylated with methyl iodide and potassium t -butoxide, and the homologous keto-ester (XXX) was alkylated by ethyl bromoacetate using sodium triphenylmethide as base. Both (XXIX) and (XXX) were alkylated with 1, 3 -dichlorobut- 2 -ene in the presence of sodium t -amyloxide but no bicyclic ring closure compounds could be obtained on treatment of the chlorocrotyl derivatives (XXXIII) and (XXXIV) with concentrated sulphuric acid. In fact the latter regressed to the keto-ester (XXX) and the former isomerised to give a solid crystalline product which could not be identified. Finally, ring extension was achieved by first reducing the olefinic bond in the monocyclic αβ-unsaturated keto-ester (XXIX) with lithium in liquid ammonia and condensing the resultant saturated keto-ester (XXXV) with the methiodide of 1 -diethylaminobutan- 3 -one using sodamide as base. The octalone (XXXVI) was isolated and a gem -dimethyl group was introduced to give (XXXVII). A description of the continuation of this work is given and also included is a variation involving the preparation of the diester (XXXVIII) by a base-catalysed ring closure of the 1, 5 -diketone (XXXIX), itself derived from the base-catalysed condensation of ethyl β-oxoadipate and methyl vinyl ketone. Ways in which this latter compound can be utilised are also presented. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLightning {{protection}} system elements {{need to be}} selected from materials which are resistant to corrosion and should be protected from fast degradation. However, over the time corrosion {{will take place in}} the presence of galvanically dissimilar metals in the same electrolyte (moisture). Historically, copper, aluminium and copper alloys (including bronze and brass) have been used in lightning protection applications as these materials are highly conductive and abundantly available. Corrosive effects on system components are influenced by the environmental factors such as moisture, soil type and temperature that make the corrosion process highly complex in soil. As per many standards on the installation of lightning {{protection system}}s, combinations of materials that naturally form <b>electrolytic</b> <b>couples</b> shall not be used, for example copper and steel, especially in the presence of moisture, in which corrosion will be accelerated. Similarly, the conditions within soil will have adverse effects on the ground system elements. Down conductors entering corrosive soil must be protected against corrosion by a protective covering.

The results indi-cate that each compound undergoes a one-electron reduction to the anion radical which then undergoes a dimerization reaction.

40|$|Voltage {{fluctuations}} in distribution networks are a power quality disturbance {{that can produce}} a number of undesirable eects, particularly if the level of fluctuation becomes excessive. Utilities and customers have a responsibility of ensuring that levels remain below values that are regarded as acceptable. In order to determine what an acceptable level might be, measurement techniques have been devised {{that are able to}} establish a quantitative measure for voltage fluctuations. The basis of these methods is the effect that voltage fluctuations have on the luminous output of the incandescent lamp. This phenomena is referred to as lamp flicker, or simply flicker. The IEC Technical Reports IEC/TR 61000 - 2 - 2 and 61000 - 2 - 12 define flicker levels that arise in response to voltage fluctuations by using short term and long term flicker severity indices, Pst and Plt, on the basis of human visual sensation which is generated by the traditional incandescent lamp types. The output from new lamp types such as compact flourescent lights are less sensitive to voltage fluctuations as their flicker characteristics are considerably different compared to those of the traditional incandescent lamp. These differences could support the moderation of the present voltage fluctuation and flicker standards and hence the associated limits. However, the severity indices used to quantify flicker do not account for effects that may be observed in the terminal characteristics of electrical equipment connected to the public supply network. Therefore, the potential detrimental effects on electrical equipment which may be caused by relaxation of these flicker limits should be investigated before any changes to the present standards take place. The related investigation presented in this thesis is motivated by this issue in addition to developing a greater insight into the impact of voltage fluctuations on common items of electrical equipment. The impact of voltage fluctuations on a single-phase, full-bridge rectifier with a capacitor filteris investigated. Such a circuit is found in many different types of equipment. By comparing the DC-link capacitor ripple current characteristic between non-fluctuating and regular fluctuating AC power supplies using mathematical analyses, simulation, and experimental verification, the investigation reveals that the DC-link capacitor will accumulate and dissipate increased amounts of charge when the rectifier is subjected to AC source voltage fluctuations. The consequence of this phenomena is that the RMS value of the capacitor current will increase and the magnitude of this increase is related to the modulation frequency and magnitude of the fluctuating voltage. Therefore, an AC supply with a voltage fluctuation component will cause the capacitor filter of the rectifier circuit to sustain increased stress. This stress may accelerate the capacitor ageing process, possibly resulting in premature equipment failure. Using a simple thermal model of an aluminium <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor <b>coupled</b> with the newly determined relationship between supply voltage fluctuations and capacitor RMS current, a lifetime model is developed. This model is used to estimate the reduction in the useful lifetime of the capacitor {{as a function of the}} severity of the voltage fluctuations applied to the rectifier and capacitor-filter combination. As a consequence of the method used for establishing the short term flicker index, Pst, the lifetime model demonstrates that Pst is an ineffective metric. The performance of widely used mains-connected three-phase induction motors heavily depends on power supply quality. Thus, the impact of voltage fluctuations on mains connected induction motors is another effect worthy of investigation. A per- phase equivalent circuit and a dynamic model has been used to analyse the impact of regular voltage fluctuations on the stator and rotor current characteristics of a squirrel cage induction motor. The outcomes of the simulation work and experimental verification indicate that the stator and rotor RMS current magnitudes of are affected significanlty by voltage fluctuations. This effect worsens as the modulation frequency and the modulation depth of the supply voltage increase. Such an increase in the RMS current will increase copper losses in the motor, resulting in winding temperature rise and subsequently accelerating the ageing process. Although the squirrel cage induction motor is a complex device, simple thermal models have been developed by a range of researchers. By applying such a thermal model, coupled with the known relationship between supply voltage fluctuations and stator RMS current, a lifetime model for the induction motor is developed. This model is used to estimate the reduction in the lifetime of the induction motor as a function of the severity of the source voltage fluctuations The short term flicker index, Pst,is shown to be an ineective metric with regard to this phenomenon. The impact of regular voltage fluctuations on an adjustable speed drive (ASD) is also investigated in this thesis. The outcomes of simulation work and experimental verification of an open-loop ASD structure connected to an induction motor coupled to various loading levels indicate that a fluctuating supply voltage will lead to an increase in the three-phase rectifier DC-link capacitor RMS current of the ASD. The magnitude of this increase is related to the modulation frequency and magnitude of the fluctuating voltage. The RMS current is observed to continue to increase as the voltage change and modulation frequency increases. The supply voltage fluctuations are also observed to pass through the rectifier circuit to the inverter and cause induction motor stator-current distortion. This thesis presents a series of impact investigations on common electrical loads and circuits found in electrical equipment. The results reveal that the standard methods of flicker measurement, Pst and Plt, cannot represent the risk to equipment degradation caused by voltage fluctuations. The evidence collected in this thesis will provide useful information to equipment manufacturers, electricity utilities, end- user customers and those involved in the development of relevant electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards...|$|R
