5|$|In Japan, {{a remote}} {{parallel}} was {{the development of}} Shibuya-kei, which also revisited the trend of foregrounding instruments like strings and horns in its arrangements.

This was partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal.
