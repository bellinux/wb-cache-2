5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> more important in determining overall risk. These risk <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting {{the proliferation of}} neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E

Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E

5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E

However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E

5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
