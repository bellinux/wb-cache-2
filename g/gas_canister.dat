5|$|During the Pakistan and Canada warm-up {{match at}} Sir Frank Worrell Memorial Ground, the sight screen was knocked {{down and the}} game was delayed by over 70 minutes and reduced to 48 overs. Additionally, a tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> {{exploded}} at the Trinidad hotel where the Pakistan, South Africa, Canada and Ireland teams were staying. The hotel had to be evacuated but no injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|In Israel, CS gas was {{reported}} to be the cause of death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah on 31 December 2010; other reports suggest that he was killed by the impact of a high-velocity CS <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> to the chest. In Egypt, CS gas {{was reported}} to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, police {{dispersed}} {{a peaceful}} demonstration in Kinshasa. Although organizers had informed local authorities as required, {{the governor of}} Kinshasa had not authorized the demonstration and ordered police to halt it. One civilian lost most of his fingers to a tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> explosion, and another fell into a coma after breathing tear gas.|$|E
25|$|After Pakistan were bowled out for 462, England {{began their}} reply. The next {{incident}} occurred when a <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> exploded within the ground, damaging the boundary hoarding and some spectators nearby. Play was halted for around 15 minutes until authorities determined {{it was safe}} to continue. However, television footage subsequently showed that Shahid Afridi had deliberately scuffed up the wicket during this distraction - an action for which he was subsequently fined, and banned for one Test match and two One Day Internationals.|$|E

25|$|During {{the night}} after Rigby's death, two mosques were attacked. In Braintree, Essex, a man entered a mosque with two knives, {{threatened}} the congregation, and threw an explosive device, which witnesses said was a grenade or <b>gas</b> <b>canister.</b> In Gillingham, Kent, a man ran into a mosque and smashed windows and bookcases, specifically targeting those containing copies of the Quran; two men were arrested {{in connection with the}} attacks. On 26 May, several petrol bombs were thrown into a mosque in Grimsby, but no one was injured and the fires were rapidly extinguished. Two former soldiers were arrested in connection with the attack.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October, the HKFS {{issued an}} open letter to the Chief Secretary Carrie Lam asking for a second round of talks. HKFS set out a {{prerequisite}} for the negotiation, that the government's report to the Chinese government must include a call for the retraction of the NPCSC's decision. The HKFS demanded direct talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang should the Hong Kong Government feel it cannot fulfil this and other terms. The 30th day since the police fired tear gas was marked at 5.57pm exactly, with 87 seconds of silence, one for each tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> that was fired.|$|E
25|$|The {{book for}} which Thompson gained {{most of his}} fame had its genesis during the {{research}} for Strange Rumblings in Aztlan, an exposé for Rolling Stone on the 1970 killing of the Mexican-American television journalist Rubén Salazar. Salazar {{had been shot in}} the head at close range with a tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> fired by officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. One of Thompson's sources for the story was Oscar Zeta Acosta, a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by Sports Illustrated to write a 250-word photograph caption on the Mint 400 motorcycle race held there.|$|E

25|$|In the present, Gareth has {{captured}} most of Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) {{group in a}} train car at Terminus. Rick encourages the group to fashion make-shift weapons as they relate their experiences that led to Terminus. Suddenly, Gareth's men throw a tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> into the car, knocking most of them out. Moments later, Gareth has Rick, Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun), and Bob (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) secured in a butchering room to be bloodlet {{so that they can}} be fed to the Terminus people. Sam (Robin Lord Taylor) (a survivor previously found Rick) and three others are killed but Gareth arrives before Rick, next in line, is killed, asking about a gun bag that he had seen Rick carrying. Rick vows to kill Gareth with one of the weapons from it.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, Tracy seeks {{revenge on}} Carla and {{inadvertently}} starts a massive {{fire in the}} Victoria Court flats. A barely conscious Carla is rescued by Leanne. Leanne went back inside to rescue Amy, followed by Kal. The residents are horrified when they find a <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> on fire. Amy and Leanne make it out safely but Kal is killed after the balcony of the flat explodes. A stray piece from the flaming debris then causes a second explosion at the nearby builders' yard, ignited by a batch of flammable chemicals. This blast hits Maddie as she walks past the yard, and she later dies from her injuries. Carla becomes addicted to a gambling habit and is a mess. She takes Tracy to a cliff and tries to commit suicide but Tracy confesses. As the factory is in tatters, Johnny Connor and son Aidan Connor and sister Kate Connor come to bail her out.|$|E
25|$|During the shootout, police {{continued}} to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying {{to flush out}} the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister.</b> As the house began to burn, two women left {{from the rear of}} the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall came out of the house. Investigators working for their parents would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire. After Hall's body fell to the ground, it was pulled back inside the burning house by Angela Atwood. Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice in the back. Her body remained outside the house.|$|E

25|$|Armed with batons, PAD forces {{surrounded}} Parliament {{and used}} razor wire barricades {{to prevent the}} legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies. The government decided {{to crack down on}} the protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went off in front of the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister.</b> She also stated that there was no need to conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.|$|E
25|$|Meinhof {{had been}} {{approached}} by Gudrun Ensslin, girlfriend of jailed arsonist Andreas Baader, for her help in securing the release of Baader from police custody. A scheme was developed where Meinhof would approach leftist publisher Klaus Wagenbach, seeking to have him hire Meinhof and the imprisoned Baader in writing a book. After securing a contract from Wagenbach (who {{was not aware of}} Meinhof's ulterior motives), Meinhof petitioned authorities to allow Baader to travel from Moabit Prison to an institute for social research in the Dahlem district of Berlin. The plan was for armed guerrillas to enter the institute and secure the release of Baader; it was intended that no shooting was to take place. Meinhof was to stay behind, and have a plausibly deniable explanation that she was not involved in the planning of Baader's escape. Baader arrived with two guards, and set to work with Meinhof in the institute's library. Two women compatriots of Ensslin's, along with a man with a criminal record (hired because of his supposed experience with armed encounters) broke into the institute. The man shot the elderly librarian Georg Linke, severely wounding him in his liver. It was later claimed that the man was holding two weapons, a pistol and a <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> gun, and accidentally fired the wrong weapon in the confusion.|$|E
25|$|In June 1969 an Australian {{tried to}} set fire to Al-Aqsa; on April 11, 1982 a Jew hid in the Dome of the Rock and sprayed gunfire, killing 2 Palestinians and {{wounding}} 44; in 1974, 1977 and 1983 groups led by Yoel Lerner conspired to blow up both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa; on 26 January 1984 Waqf guards detected members of B'nei Yehuda, a messianic cult of former gangsters turned mystics based in Lifta, trying to infiltrate the area to blow it up. On October 8, 1990, Israeli forces patrolling the site blocked worshippers from accessing it. A tear <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> was detonated among the female worshippers, which caused events to escalate. On 12 October 1990 Palestinian Muslims protested violently the intention of some extremist Jews to lay a cornerstone on the site for a New Temple {{as a prelude to}} the destruction of the Muslim mosques. The attempt was blocked by Israeli authorities but demonstrators were widely reported as having stoned Jews at the Western Wall. According to Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi, investigative journalism has shown this allegation to be false. Rocks were eventually thrown, while security forces fired rounds that ended up killing 21 people and injuring 150 more. An Israeli inquiry found Israeli forces at fault, but it also concluded that charges could not be brought against any particular individuals. In December 1997, Israeli security services preempted an attempt by Jewish extremists to throw a pig's head wrapped {{in the pages of the}} Quran into the area, in order to spark a riot and embarrass the government.|$|E

[...] The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry received information that a further three deaths may have been attributable to the use of CS gas. [...] Of these three, one allegedly died from the impact of the canister, and two from the effects of inhaling the gas.|$|E
500|$|Orci came up {{with the}} idea to start the episode in a church's confessional, while the ambered scene on the bus was {{originally}} scripted to take place on a subway; one of the writers felt the bus [...] "let you see more of the city". Early in the show's creation the writers were trying to figure out what Fringe could be, and ultimately chose [...] "big crazy event" [...] at the start of each episode that would catapult its plot and drive its characters. They felt the bus scene essentially achieved this. When creating the scene on the bus when the <b>gas</b> <b>canister</b> is released, the crew sat on a bus that was really driving through the streets of New York City; director Frederick Toye called the shooting [...] "Student film style, run and gun". To shoot the three scenes of the bus in the tunnel, the crew looked at a variety of locations before choosing a tunnel near the United Nations headquarters on the east side of Manhattan. As it was a busy area, they had to shoot at night and then attempt to make it appear to be daytime, as the scenes were set during the day. They had a limited schedule to shoot all three scenes, and despite never having seen the tunnel before, the production crews had 8–9 hours to quickly set up the massive set and leave enough time to shoot the scenes before dawn approached. To simulate being encased in amber, the actors had to pretend they were frozen.|$|E
