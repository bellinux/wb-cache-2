50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame {{is between the}} front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> <b>device</b> for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> <b>device,</b> lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> <b>device</b> cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|E
50|$|For gas appliances, a flame {{supervision}} device (FSD) - alternative name: <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> <b>device</b> (FFD) - is {{a general}} term for any device designed to stop flammable gas going to the burner of a gas appliance if the flame is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room. Causes of flame failure include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the draught from an oven door being opened and closed.|$|E
5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> <b>device</b> for gas hobs and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.|$|E

50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid.

This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot <b>flame</b> <b>failure,</b> but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|R
30|$|Identifying QoS {{bottlenecks}}. Determining QoS bottlenecks {{can help}} to enhance system performance and consequently improving vMOS. However, it is also difficult to identify the QoS bottlenecks since they are often affected by many factors.

There is a challenge in identifying the causality of stalling. In the future, we may apply data-driven approach to identify the reason behind video stalling according to different scenarios.|$|R

30|$|During service execution, service {{disruptions}} {{can happen}} due to faults in the pervasive environment. Shiva Chetan et al. [13] classified the faults {{that occur in}} the pervasive system as service <b>failures,</b> <b>device</b> <b>failures,</b> network failures and application failures. These faults greatly interrupt the service execution and will lead to a situation where service providers are constrained to complete their service requests. During such cases, the Service Selection framework have to invoke once again the service selection methodology to identify the next best service provider and the new service execution has to be re-started. In most cases, multiple services are offered by the service provider. Therefore, during such faults, one or more services will be affected thereby giving rise to higher service delay and service recovery overhead. Though attempts are made to provide best services to the user, executing the service without service disruptions, with minimal service delay and service recovery overhead is an important challenge in the pervasive environment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates two generalized methods, i. e., {{a simple}} universal index and oscillation frequency, for the {{quantitative assessment of}} flame stability at fossil-fuel-fired furnaces. The index is proposed to assess the stability of flame {{in terms of its}} color, geometry, and luminance. It is designed by combining up to seven characteristic parameters extracted from flame images. The oscillation frequency is derived from the spectral analysis of flame radiation signals. The measurements involved in these two methods do not require prior knowledge about fuel property, burner type, and other operation conditions. They can therefore be easily applied to flame stability assessment without costly and complex adaption. Experiments were carried out on a 9 -MW heavy-oil-fired combustion test rig over a wide range of combustion conditions including variations in swirl vane position of the tertiary air, swirl vane position of the secondary air, and the ratio of the primary air to the total air. The impact of these burner parameters on the stability of heavy oil flames is investigated by using the index and oscillation frequency proposed. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and the importance of maintaining a stable flame for reduced NOx emissions. It is envisaged that such methods can be easily transferred to existing flame closed-circuit television systems and <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> detectors in power stations for flame stability monitoring...|$|R
