Ishikawa and Okada reported some cases of the yellow coloured skin after taking much pumpkin. In November of 1937, the author who has investigated during about the 16 years in the islands of Paran and Saipan observed {{for the first}} time a case caused by taking papayas which is the common name of the fruit of caria papaya planted in nearly all the islands of the tropical territories;- A japanese girl aged 16, taking the advice of a certain doctor who had examined her under the diagnosis of beriberi, ate two papayas as large as a baby head every day in October last. At the begining of November, she happened to notice her hands and feet growing yellow. Gmelin 2 ̆ 7 s test for bile pigments in her urine was examined for repeatedly but always was negative not only on the mucous membrane of the eyes and throat, but on other parts of the skin of her face, body and extremities, were scarcely yellow coloured, except the palm of the hands and the soles of the feet. The yellow pigment remained there for over 2 months after she had ceased taking papayas, and neither pains nor itching took place. The hard parts of the palms and soles were remarkably coloured with yellow pigment, especially when finger-pressure was put on them. According to the investigation of Dr. Kariyone the pigment which is contained within papayas is the <b>Kryptoxanthin</b> (C 40 H 56 O), a kind of carotinoid. Therefore the author believes that the cause of this aurantiasis cutis is due to having taken too much papaya. (The Author 2 ̆ 7 s abstract...|$|E
40|$|The pigment of {{the yellow}} flowers of the silk oak (Grevillea robusta, Cunningham) {{does not appear to}} have been {{investigated}} heretofore. If the dried material is extracted with ether, the solution shows typical absorption maxima at 483 and 453 mµ,corresponding to the spectrum of p-carotene. The rather blurred borders of these bands indicate, however, the presence of other polyenic pigments in small quantities. After saponification a photometric analysis of the total extract gave values which would correspond to 270 mg. of β-carotene in 1 kilo of the dry flowers if no other pigments were present. After a chromatographic separation the true β-carotene content was found to be about 215 mg. per kilo. Two-thirds of this amount was isolated as crystals; lycopene or γ- and α-carotene were not present [1]. The non-carotene fraction is a complicated xanthophyll mixture in which no single compound predominates. From this fraction two very small amounts of crystalline material were isolated, one of which was <b>kryptoxanthin</b> and the other a new carotenoid possessing a remarkably short wave-length spectrum. For the separation and study of carotenoids contained in extracts we suggest the systematic use of the ultraviolet lamp which has been so helpful in the chromatography of colorless substances (2). Plant pigments are frequently accompanied by large amounts of colorless material which prevent the formation of sharp pigment zones in the Tswett column and thus a satisfactory separation of the components. Furthermore, the crystallization of some carotenoids may be hindered. Fortunately many such colorless substances show an intense fluorescence (3). An observation made in ultraviolet light during the chromatographic separation of the pigments may furnish a good indication of the best method and optimum extent of developing the chromatogram. The distribution of the fluorescence may also indicate the lines at which it is best to cut the column. By sacrificing small amounts of pigment large portions of colorless associated material may be eliminated in this simple way...|$|E
