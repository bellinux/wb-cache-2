40|$|The astronaut's {{life and}} work is so {{different}} from our own daily experiences that it s {{easy to forget that}} astronauts are people, too. Just like everyone else, astronauts have basic nutritional needs, such as five to nine servings of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables per day, in order to maintain optimal health. Here on Earth, it can be a challenge to incorporate the recommended amount of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>veggies</b> into our diets, despite easy access to fresh produce. In space, it becomes even more difficult, as astronauts must take everything they need with them. And in the harsh conditions of space, many miles from medical assistance, proper nutrition takes on added importance. As NASA makes plans to send astronauts on missions that could take months and even years, the Agency explores new ways to provide astronauts with a daily dose of nutrition equivalent to that provided by fresh produce. These foods are critically important because they provide the essential vitamins, minerals, pigments, and other micronutrients (substances required in small amounts for human health) that promote everything from healthy skin to a strong heart...|$|R
50|$|Today {{the garden}} {{is open to the}} public. It is {{currently}} under the direction of Antoine Jacobsohn., and produces over fifty tons of fruits and thirty tons of vegetables each year, which are sold in Versailles markets and at the school. About 400 varieties of fruit trees and many varieties of vegetables are grown at the Potager, making more exotic <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>veggies</b> available to the French public. In addition to teaching, the school regularly re-introduces historic varieties and carries on an extensive program of experimentation. Students come with at least two years' prior university education, and spend a further four years studying at Versailles, including carrying out studies on their own small plots, and planning and executing a project on a particular terrain.|$|E

50|$|The co-op is a faux Tudor mansion {{built in}} 1906 during the Decorative Art's Movement by John Galen Howard, noted {{architect}} of Doe Library and Sather Tower. Ridge House {{was commissioned by}} the University of California Berkeley for a prospective faculty member, who ultimately turned down the offer and the estate. The land, and historic Ridge House remained in University hands for a time, during which it was the temporary private residence of the Hearst children during their undergraduate years at U.C. Berkeley. Following its use by the Hearst family, the house became a sorority house for the University. As a co-op, Ridge House, purchased by the Berkeley Student Cooperative, (formerly the University Student Cooperative Association) in 1944, was originally all-male, but was later opened to all gender identities. Though now retrofitted {{for the purposes of}} student housing, there are still four working Rumford fireplaces, exposed, half-timber redwood beams, a secret passageways and the remnants of an archaic subterranean speaker system used to pipe chamber music into various rooms of the house. The Second floor of the house has retained most of the original features of the home. This included the Ballroom, which has remained largely intact and now serves as the Dining room for the Ridgelings. The former dining room, found on the same floor was converted into an extension of the kitchen following a remodeling of this space in 1989. This reutilization included the construction of a second door to the kitchen and the concealment of the dining room fireplace behind a false wall. Changes to this floor also included the conversion of the balcony on this floor into an additional room, with the balcony elevated to the third-floor. While the library and drawing room have been both converted into living spaces, Ridge House none-the-less maintains the greatest ratio of common space to numbers of residents, per capita, of houses in the BSC. Ridge currently sits on roughly 1/2 acre of land, all that remains of the original parcel that once span from Euclid Avenue to Scenic. While the land to the east is now occupied by Casa Zimbabwe (formerly known as Ridge Project), the two houses share a common courtyard and Ridge maintains an ample garden, which services both as a respite from urban living and a way of growing fresh <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>veggies</b> for its members.|$|E

40|$|Tackling {{a buffet}} at your Super Bowl gathering? Practice these game rules {{and keep the}} runs on the field. Keep it clean. Before you eat or handle food, {{thoroughly}} wash your hands, food prep tools and surfaces, and all <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>veggies.</b> Cook it well. Measure minimum internal temperatures with a food thermometer. For party faves, like chicken wings and ground beef sliders, {{make sure that they}} reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit and 160 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. Be a winner. Invest in a good food thermometer for you or someone you love. Watch the clock. Follow recommended microwave cooking and standing times (the extra minutes needed for food to cook completely). Track how long foods have been on the buffet. Discard after two hours. Keep it safe. Use chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays to keep hot food at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or more. Keep cold foods, like salsa and dips, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Next serving dishes in bowls of ice or use small trays. Replace ice often. Be aware of the "danger zone" between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit where harmful bacteria grows. Play it safe and refrigerate food within two hours. Protect all "to-gos. " Discard foods that have been on the buffet more than two hours. Divide leftovers into smaller portions, place in shallow containers, and refrigerate. Intercept mix-ups. Separate raw meats from read-to-eat foods, like veggies. Provide serving utensils and small plates to discourage eating directly from bowls with dips and salsa. If you see "double-dippers" (folks who repeatedly eat or dip from a shared food dish), throw the penalty flag before someone is down on the field.
