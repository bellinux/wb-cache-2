5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of {{each part of the}} brain.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes <b>electroencephalography</b> (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, <b>electroencephalography</b> may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. <b>Electroencephalography</b> and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of people, {{but not all}} hyperammonaemia (high ammonia levels) is associated with encephalopathy. A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy, when cerebral oedema may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. <b>Electroencephalography</b> shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{processing}} of the EEG is often named quantitative <b>electroencephalography</b> (qEEG).|$|E
25|$|The normal <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) {{varies by}} age. The {{neonatal}} EEG {{is quite different}} from the adult EEG. The EEG in childhood generally has slower frequency oscillations than the adult EEG.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electroencephalography</b> (EEG) is {{the most}} studied {{non-invasive}} interface, mainly due to its fine temporal resolution, ease of use, portability and low set-up cost. The technology is somewhat susceptible to noise however.|$|E
25|$|Electrophysiology : The use of {{electrophysiological}} measures {{designed to}} measure the activation of the brain by measuring the electrical or magnetic field produced by the nervous system. This may include <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, {{myoclonus}} may {{originate from}} lesions of the cortex, subcortex or spinal cord. The presence of myoclonus above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus; further localisation relies on further investigation with electromyography (EMG) and <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG).|$|E
25|$|Most {{headaches}} can {{be diagnosed}} by the clinical history alone. If the symptoms {{described by the}} person sound dangerous, further testing with neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be necessary. <b>Electroencephalography</b> (EEG) is not useful for headache diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Dictionary {{learning}} {{is used to}} analyse medical signals in detail. Such medical signals include those from <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fuctional MRI (fMRI), and ultrasound computer tomography (USCT), where different assumptions are used to analyze each signal.|$|E
25|$|The scenes {{involving}} Regan's {{medical tests}} were filmed at New York University Medical Center and were performed by actual medical staff that normally {{carry out the}} procedures. In the film Regan first undergoes an <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), then an early type of cerebral angiography and finally a pneumoencephalography.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of triple X women are never diagnosed, unless they undergo tests for other medical reasons later in life. Triple X can be diagnosed by a blood test which is {{able to look at}} a person’s chromosomes (karyotype). Abnormalities on the <b>electroencephalography</b> may be present.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly <b>electroencephalography</b> if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve <b>electroencephalography,</b> electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
25|$|An evoked {{potential}} or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from {{the nervous system}} of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiologic recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|EMOTIV Inc. is {{a privately}} held bio-informatics and {{technology}} company developing and manufacturing wearable EEG (<b>Electroencephalography)</b> technologies including Neuroheadsets, SDK’s, Software, Mobile Apps and Data products. Founded in 2011 by Tan Le and Dr. Geoff Mackellar, {{the company is}} headquartered in San Francisco, U.S.A. with facilities in Sydney, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} brain–computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) starts with Hans Berger's {{discovery of the}} electrical activity {{of the human brain}} and the development of <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG. Berger was able to identify oscillatory activity, such as Berger's wave or the alpha wave (8–13Hz), by analyzing EEG traces.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Fisher and Lowenback first {{demonstrated}} epileptiform spikes. In 1935 Gibbs, Davis and Lennox described interictal spike {{waves and}} the three cycles/s pattern of clinical absence seizures, which began the field of clinical <b>electroencephalography.</b> Subsequently, in 1936 Gibbs and Jasper reported the interictal spike as the focal signature of epilepsy. The same year, the first EEG laboratory opened at Massachusetts General Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Measurement and {{recording}} techniques {{which are not}} primarily designed to produce images, such as <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and others represent other technologies which produce data susceptible to representation as a parameter graph vs. time or maps which contain data about the measurement locations. In a limited comparison these technologies {{can be considered as}} forms of medical imaging in another discipline.|$|E
25|$|Not only do EEGs capture {{dendritic}} currents {{almost exclusively}} {{as opposed to}} axonal currents, they also show a preference for activity on populations of parallel dendrites and transmitting current {{in the same direction}} at the same time. Pyramidal neurons of cortical layers II/III and V extend apical dendrites to layer I. Currents moving up or down these processes underlie most of the signals produced by <b>electroencephalography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newer, {{non-invasive}} techniques {{now include}} brain imaging by {{positron emission tomography}} (PET); {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.|$|E
25|$|MRIs can {{determine}} if the symptoms are caused by certain brain disorders, stroke, and Multiple Sclerosis. Lumbar puncture {{can determine}} if there is Encephalitis. KLS must be differentiated from substance abuse by toxicology tests. The use of <b>Electroencephalography</b> (EEG) can exclude temporal status epilepticus from consideration. EEGs are normal in about 70% of KLS patients, but background slowing may sometimes be detected. In addition, low-frequency high-amplitude waves can be observed during waking hours.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{neurophysiology}} {{is concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include <b>electroencephalography,</b> electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.|$|E
25|$|During a night's sleep, a {{small portion}} is usually spent in a waking state. As {{measured}} by <b>electroencephalography,</b> young females are awake for 0–1% of the larger sleeping period; young males are awake for 0–2%. In adults, wakefulness increases, especially in later cycles. One study found 3% awake time in the first ninety-minute sleep cycle, 8% in the second, 10% in the third, 12% in the fourth, and 13–14% in the fifth. Most of this awake time occurred shortly after REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|With so many {{possible}} symptoms, hysteria was often considered a catchall diagnosis where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned. As diagnostic techniques improved, {{the number of}} ambiguous cases {{that might have been}} attributed to hysteria declined. For instance, before the introduction of <b>electroencephalography,</b> epilepsy was frequently confused with hysteria. Many cases that had previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by Sigmund Freud as anxiety neuroses. As a result, theories relating to hysteria came from pure speculation. Doctors and physicians could not connect symptoms to the disorder, causing it to decline rapidly.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E
25|$|Silver {{chloride}} electrodes {{are also}} used by many applications of biological electrode systems such as biomonitoring sensors as part of electrocardiography (ECG) and <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG), and in {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) to deliver current. Historically, the electrodes were fabricated from solid materials such as silver, brass coated with silver, tin and nickel. In today's applications, most biomonitoring electrodes are silver/silver chloride sensors which are fabricated by coating a thin layer of silver on plastic substrates and the outer layer of silver is converted to silver chloride.|$|E
25|$|Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and {{his student}} Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye {{movement}} and linked it to dreams in 1953 and further described by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet. Many experiments have involved awakening test subjects whenever they begin to enter the REM phase, thereby producing a state known as REM deprivation. Subjects allowed to sleep normally again usually experience a modest REM rebound. Techniques of neurosurgery, chemical injection, <b>electroencephalography,</b> positron emission tomography, and reports of dreamers upon waking, have all been used to study this phase of sleep.|$|E
25|$|The Neurobiology of Language Department, {{headed by}} Peter Hagoort, {{focuses on the}} study of {{language}} production, language comprehension, and language acquisition from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. This includes using neuroimaging, behavioral and virtual reality techniques to investigate the language system and its neural underpinnings. Research facilities at the Max Planck Institute include a high-density <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG) lab, a virtual reality laboratory and several behavioral laboratories. Having a part of the department stationed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, it also has access to a whole-head 275 channel MEG system, MRI-scanners at 1.5, 3 and 7 Tesla, a TMS-lab, and several additional EEG laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Electrocorticography (ECoG) {{measures}} the electrical {{activity of the}} brain taken from beneath the skull {{in a similar way}} to non-invasive <b>electroencephalography</b> (see below), but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the dura mater. ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play Space Invaders using his ECoG implant. This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} throughout {{the central nervous}} system at all levels, and include spike trains, local field potentials and large-scale oscillations which can be measured by <b>electroencephalography</b> (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using time-frequency analysis. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a neural ensemble, also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.|$|E
25|$|Phase {{resetting}} also {{permits the}} study of evoked activity, a term used in <b>electroencephalography</b> and magnetoencephalography for responses in brain activity that {{are directly related to}} stimulus-related activity. Evoked potentials and event-related potentials are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.|$|E
25|$|Eyelid {{fluttering}} {{artifacts of}} a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually {{seen in the}} prefrontal leads, that is, just over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4–7nbsp&Hz) or Alpha (7–14nbsp&Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute {{that it was difficult}} to see. They are in fact noise in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, current usage in <b>electroencephalography</b> refers to the phenomenon as an eyelid fluttering artifact, rather than a Kappa rhythm (or wave).|$|E
25|$|Koji Sato (1905–1971) {{began the}} {{publication}} of the journal, Psychologia: An International Journal of Psychology in the Orient in 1957 with the aim of providing a comparative psychological dialogue between East and West (with contributions from Bruner, Fromm, and Jung). In the 1960s, Kasamatsu and Hirai used <b>Electroencephalography</b> to monitor the brains of Zen meditators. This led to the promotion of various studies covering psychiatry, physiology, and psychology of Zen by the Japanese ministry of education which were carried out in various laboratories. Another important researcher in this field, Prof. Yoshiharu Akishige, promoted Zen Psychology, the idea that the insights of Zen should not just be studied but that they should inform psychological practice. Research in this field continues with the work of Japanese psychologists such as Akira Onda and Osamu Ando.|$|E
