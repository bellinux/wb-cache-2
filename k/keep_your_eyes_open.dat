6000|$|... "Ay--ay--Morganic, you'll {{be remembered}} in proper time. In the mean while, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> people's <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> {{so as not}} to lose sight of the French. We shall have {{something}} to say to them in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a smart boy, Billy. Now do as I tell 'ee, and <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> weather <b>eye</b> <b>open.</b> D'ye {{see that}} bit o' {{floating}} wreck a-head? Well, keep straight {{for that and}} run right against it. I'll trust to 'ee, boy, that ye don't miss it." ...|$|R

Beware of them, whether they bring gifts or thunderbolts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Sam, {{it is up}} to you to give me {{the points}} of the compass," [...] said Dick. [...] "And, Tom you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> for the lights of Sherodburg and Fremville." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We're {{not out of}} {{the woods}} yet, Cato," [...] he said dryly; [...] "nor are they. <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears <b>open,</b> and attend to me. How long can we keep in the cover of these woods, and still push on in the {{direction}} of the quarters?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Ben sat thoughtfully {{for some}} time, and then, {{making all the}} {{preparations}} which Toby knew so well signified a long bit of advice, he said: [...] "Toby, my boy, I've been with a circus, man an' boy, nigh to forty years, an' I've seen lots of youngsters start in just as you re goin' to start in tomorrow; but the most of them petered out, because they got to knowin' more 'n them that learned 'em did. Now, you remember what I say, an' you'll find it good advice: whatever business you get into, don't think you {{know all about it}} before you've begun. Remember that you can always learn somethin', no matter how old you are, an' <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> an' ears <b>open,</b> an' your tongue between your teeth, an' you'll amount to somethin', or my name hain't Ben." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, my son, I've been {{thinking}} about you a considerable bit since I found {{it was no use}} trying to scare you out of the plan, and in a year's time or so, I reckon, between the captain and Walters and me, we can get you in up to headquarters. Now, don't jump so! I didn't mean we allowed you could go there as a recruit; but the captain was saying the other night that we might work it so's you could get some kind of a berth there--sweeping floors, washing windows, and the like of that, which, if you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> ears and <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> would amount to the same as if you went into actual training. You ain't the lad I've got in my eye if you couldn't soon work your way into one of the classes." ...|$|R
