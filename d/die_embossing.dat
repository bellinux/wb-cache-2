50|$|Another method {{produces}} a deep engraving with sloped shoulders. In this method, the metal (usually zinc or magnesium) is held face {{down and a}} mixture of nitric acid and a soap-like oil is splashed onto it. As the acid etches the surface, the oil adheres {{to the edges of}} the exposed area. This progressively reduces the area being etched, resulting in a sloped edge; a single dot will end up as a cone-shaped mound protruding from the etched area. This method is used for printing plates (the shoulder supports the printing surface), foil stamping <b>dies</b> and <b>embossing</b> <b>dies.</b> Decorative engravings made by this method may go through a second process to produce a decorative background. The raised parts and their shoulders are painted with an etchant-resistant material and a pattern of etchant-resistant material is applied to the deep parts of the engraving. The resist for the background may be another photoengraving or may be randomly splashed on. The engraving is etched again for a short time to produce a raised pattern in the background. Decorative engravings of this type may also be spray-painted and sanded as in the previous method.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a {{high speed}} forming {{technique}} {{that can be used}} for embossing fine surface features onto sheet metals.

In the first part of this work high velocity is generated with the Uniform Pressure Actuator (UPA) and impact with a <b>die</b> <b>emboss</b> fine features in a nominally flat component. The primary objective of this work is to develop a modelling facility that guides experimental design nominally flat grooved components. Both shape fidelity and formability aspects are presently considered. In a second short study expansion of a round tube into a square hole is considered. Traditional modelling techniques solve a coupled system of equations with spatially varying electromagnetic fluxes controlling the dynamics of the plastic deformation. Because the magnetic pressure is spatially uniform, the flux equations are obviated from the coupled system rendering them computationally efficient. The calibration of contact mechanics that influence the rebound behaviour of the sheet metal remains as a difficult issue. The interfaces between various sheet metals and the metal die play a critical role in controlling the shape of the final product. The characterization of such an interface using appropriate calibrated friction coefficients is assessed. The role of magnetic pressure in reducing the sheet metal rebound is demonstrated via a comparison between results from mechanical and electromagnetic simulations. The influence of the channel geometry on final shape is illustrated through simulation and experiments...|$|R

50|$|Often used in {{combination}} with foil stamping, embossing alters the surface of paper stock or other substrates by providing a three-dimensional or raised effect on selected areas. The procedure {{requires the use of}} two dies: one that is raised and one that is recessed. The dies fit into each other so that when the paper is pressed between them, the raised die forces the stock into the recessed die and creates the embossed impression. A specific level of pressure is applied to the dies in order to squeeze the fibers of the paper, which results in a permanently raised area in the paper.When the dies are produced, a die maker engraves the desired image into several metal plates, which are the <b>embossing</b> <b>dies</b> for use on an embossing press. A thorough understanding the process will enable a more successful result. Generally, embossing is the process most often employed to attract attention or convey a high quality textural contrast in relation to the surrounding area of the paper stock.|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the novel {{fabrication}} of optically variable watermarks (OVW) in a transparent substrate. The OVW is incorporated into the substrate via an embossing process. The master <b>embossing</b> <b>die</b> is produced {{by a combination of}} electron beam lithography, greytone photolithography, and precision electroplating techniques. The micro-embossing into polypropylene film is performed at 130 °C and 100 kN, a similar pressure to that used in intaglio printing. The optical effect produced by the device corresponds to a switch from one image to another as the device is observed in transmission when held in front of a light source and moved up and down. The image switching mechanism {{is a result of the}} refraction of the incident light through the embossed interlaced rows of micro-prisms, with the two different images corresponding to opposite prism slopes. Specific results reported here include an OVW image switch from a "$" to a " 50 " symbol and a second test image corresponding to an image switch from a portrait to a logo style image. Applications of the OVW technology include anti-counterfeiting protection for polymer banknotes, identity cards with transparent regions and labels attached to brand name products...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for embossing polymer foil substrates (1) for production of components {{in the areas of}} micro fluidics, biotechnology, medicine and chemistry, comprises an embossing roll (3), heat conducting bodies (9, 10) and homogeneous temperable surfaces (11). The foil substrates exhibit the embossing roll and a unit for supplying the foil substrate to the embossing roll. The heat conducting material of the body is metal and/or graphite. Distance of overlapping surfaces of both bodies is five times less than the foil substrate thickness. An embossing or overlapping region of the foil substrate is conductible between the surfaces by the supplying unit. The heat conducting bodies in conveying direction of the foil substrates are directly arranged before the embossing roll. Each of the heat conducting bodies exhibits a heat capacity, which is larger than the heat capacity of the overlapping surface of the embedded foil substrate. The temperable surfaces of both bodies are spaced apart from each other and overlap within a coherent lap region. The overlapping region exhibits a shape and size, which correspond to the shape and size of the embossing regions of the <b>embossing</b> <b>die</b> or the <b>embossing</b> regions of the embossing roll. The temperable surfaces are rectangular and exhibit a counter contour three-dimensional surface contour. The bodies exhibit a metal plate shape with a width, a length and a thickness. The plate thickness is more than 5 mm. A first overlapping surface corresponds to a part of a cylinder outer cover inner surface of a first cylinder with a cylinder diameter D 1. A second overlapping surface corresponds to a part of a cylinder cover inner surface of a second cylinder with a cylinder diameter D 2. The diameter D 1 is less than the diameter D 2. The device is intended a negative pressure system connected with one of the body and the foil substrate is suctionable at the surface of this body by means of negative pressure. Means is provided for the adjustment of predefinable distances between the overlapping surfaces of the body. A tempering system provided with the surfaces is formed {{in such a way that}} the surfaces are temperable at 0 - 250 degreesC with an accuracy of plus minus 0. 1 degreesK respectively. The tempering system is formed in such a way that one of the surfaces is temperable at temperature T 1 greater than Tg and the other surfaces at temperature T 2 less than Tg. The thermal energy of the bodies is supplyable in the form infrared radiation by means of inductive heating, electrical resistive heating or heat exchanger. The foil substrate is a foil laminate composed of two single foils, which exhibit different glass transitions. The device is operated cyclically and/or continuously. USE - Useful for embossing foil substrates for production of components in the field of micro fluidics, biotechnology, medicine and chemistry. ADVANTAGE - The device avoids a small temperature difference between an upper and lower side of foil substrates, thus preventing the default of the foil substrate during the cooling-off of the foil substrate.
