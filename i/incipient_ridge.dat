The Galapagos Microplate is bounded by the Dietz volcanic ridge at 1°10'N, south of the Cocos-Nazca Ridge, and the Northern Galapagos Microplate (NGMP) is bounded by the <b>Incipient</b> <b>Ridge</b> at 2°40'N, north of Cocos-Nazca Ridge. The westward propagating and slowly diverging Cocos-Nazca Ridge cuts between the two sub-plates toward the East Pacific Rise. However, the tip of Cocos-Nazca Ridge does not fully meet the East Pacific Rise and, in fact, the westerly propagating Cocos-Nazca Ridge generates secondary transient rifts by shear stresses. The tip of the Cocos-Nazca ridge has maintained a distance of 50 km from the East Pacifc Rise and slightly moved its position into {{the eastern part of the}} microplate due to clockwise rotation of the GMP.|$|E
40|$|Holocene coastal sand ridge plains, {{also known}} as prograded {{barriers}} or strandplains, occur on many coastlines around the world. During the 20 th century and into the 21 st century, these coastal landforms have been investigated {{in order to understand}} the timing and mode of their emplacement, and their potential as paleoenvironmental records. Radiocarbon dating of coastal sand ridge plains in southeastern Australia has made a significant contribution to our knowledge of the Holocene deposition of these environments. This study examines three coastal sand ridge plains in southeastern Australia: Moruya (Bengello Beach), Wonboyn and Callala Beach. The Holocene depositional history of these sites was investigated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of aeolian sands from individual ridges to construct a chronology of progradation. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to image subsurface structures, and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data provided a detailed picture of the morphology of each site. LiDAR data also enabled the determination of precise ridge heights and the calculation of aeolian sediment volumes. OSL dating at each site demonstrated that progradation proceeded at linear rates from ~ 7500 years ago to present. The OSL chronology of progradation at Moruya was a significant revision to the previously accepted pattern implied by radiocarbon dating. The age of progradation commencement around ~ 7500 years ago at each site corresponds closely with cessation of the post-glacial marine transgression on this coastline. Rates of progradation at Moruya and Wonboyn were ~ 0. 3 m/yr, while Callala Beach prograded at ~ 0. 1 m/yr. The Moruya embayment had the highest average aeolian sediment accumulation rate of the three sites at ~ 3600 m 3 /yr, Wonboyn had a slightly lower value of ~ 1760 m 3 /yr and Callala Beach had the lowest average sediment delivery at ~ 650 m 3 /yr. GPR data collected in shore normal transects across each site demonstrated that each barrier has built seawards in increments with a series of preserved storm beachfaces separated by accumulated material. The process of ridge building indicated by the GPR imaged reflectors appears similar to the process of <b>incipient</b> <b>ridge</b> development observed at Moruya in beach profiling over the past ~ 40 years; where ridge building occurs during post-storm recovery of the beachface. Each site is dominated by a modern foredune which is substantially higher than all other landward ridges. At Moruya, GPR across this foredune reveals a series of landward dipping reflectors indicating the landward cascading of aeolian sediments not observed on any other ridges. These foredunes appear to represent an unprecedented degree of dune development on these barriers. This reconstruction of Holocene deposition at Moruya, Wonboyn and Callala Beach may inform future management of sandy coastlines as it quantifies the volumes of sediment involved in coastal progradation in southeastern Australia...|$|E

Dots and <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges</b> are extracted by tracing valley. Starting points are {{found on the}} valley by analyzing the frequencies present in the fingerprint. Valleys are traced from the starting point using Fast Marching Method (FMM). An intensity based checking method is used for finding these feature points. Delaunay triangle has been constructed using level 2 feature. A novel algorithm of selecting compatible triangle pair from Delaunay triangle is proposed. A novel set of feature parameters are constructed by establishing spatial relation between minutiae and dots-and-incipient. Pore based matching has been performed using Robust Affine Iterative Closest Point algorithm. These extended features (dots, <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges,</b> and pores) are helpful for forensic experts. However, forensic experts deal with full-to-partial print matching of latent fingerprint. Hence, Full-to-partial fingerprint matching has been carried out. Partial print is constructed by cropping a window from a full fingerprint in two ways such as, non-overlapped cropping and random cropping. Form the experiment, {{it has been observed}} that random cropping based fingerprint has better accuracy than non-overlapped cropping. For performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm, two public databases have been used: NIST SD 30 database and IIIT Delhi rural database. All images in SD 30 are taken in constrained environment and images in IIIT database are taken in unconstrained environment. Feature level and score level fusion have been carried out for fusing different levels of feature. It has been observed that score level fusion shows better accuracy than feature level fusion...|$|R
40|$|Personal {{identification}} {{based on}} fingerprints {{is very popular}} compared to identification based on other biometric features like iris, gait and face etc. Performance of automatic fingerprints identification systems depends upon the quality of fingerprints. Extraction of fingerprints features in poor quality fingerprints is challenging task. Accurate measurement of fingerprints feature improves the accuracy of identification systems. Fingerprints consists of ridge and valley structures and offers different types of features, they are categorized as level 1, level 2 and level 3 features. Level 1 features are singular points which are used for fingerprints registration, classification etc. Level 2 features are ridge features like minutiae points, ridge orientation etc., and commercially available fingerprint recognition systems are based on level 2 features. Level 3 features include sweat pores, <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges</b> etc. Among these features ridge orientation is used for fingerprint enhancement, fingerprint classification, indexing and fingerprint segmentation.

40|$|Tristan da Cunha {{is a small}} {{volcanic}} {{island in}} the South Atlantic Ocean close to the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. It {{is part of an}} area, which is characterized by widely scattered seamounts and small islands at the western end of the Walvis Ridge - Tristan/Gough hotspot track. Tristan da Cunha represents the end member of a classical hotspot track with an underlying plume: The active volcanic island Tristan da Cunha at the youngest end of the track is linked to the Cretaceous Etendeka flood basalt province in northwestern Namibia at its oldest end. But the genesis of the island itself has so far been puzzling. It is hotly debated if the island sits actually above a deep-seated mantle plume or if it is caused by shallow plate tectonics. To understand the Tristan da Cunha hotspot, a multi-disciplinary geophysical study has been conducted in 2012 and 2013 on board the German research vessel Maria S. Merian to acquire marine magnetotelluric and seismological data. The aim was to reveal the upper mantle structure with electrical density and velocity perturbations. Within this study I focused on the seismological dataset. At first, I performed a P-wave finite-frequency tomography with cross-correlated travel time residuals of teleseismic earthquakes. This allows to resolve the upper mantle structure beneath the island in terms of velocity perturbations and clarifies the existence of a mantle plume. I also investigated the local seismicity in the Tristan region to identify tectono-magmatic processes at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Close to the islands and seamounts. Moreover, I compared and combined my tomographic results with electromagnetic results to identify zones of partial melt and to understand plume processes in the upper mantle beneath the Tristan da Cunha hotspot. The tomographic results provide evidence for the existence of the Tristan conduit southwest of the archipelago. Its shape is cylindrical with a radius ca. 100 km down to a depth of 250 km. The structure ramifies in narrow veins below that depth. A recent link from the conduit to a seamount chain shows, that melt is channelled towards seamounts and islands in the study area. High seismicity within an oceanic plate segment north of Tristan da Cunha can be related to the internal stresses of the fragment. Differently directed forces act at the northern boundary of this plate. An earthquake free zone coincides spatially with the location of the Tristan mantle plume. This indicates a ductile regime in the lithosphere above the plume. Furthermore, hints for an <b>incipient</b> <b>ridge</b> jump towards a parallel line to the actual location of the Tristan plume were found. Several earthquakes were localised close to the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. The locations of these earthquakes are related to young surface eruptions like small volcanic cones or seamounts...|$|E
40|$|Biometrics {{consists}} of automated methods for identifying and recognizing a person {{which can be}} either {{in the form of}} physiological or behavioral traits. Some of the features being considered are face, fingerprints, hand geometry, handwriting and voice. Fingerprint friction ridge details are hierarchically divided into 3 different levels which ranges from pattern (Level 1) to minutia points (Level 2) and to pores and ridge contours (Level 3). Latent print examiners frequently use Level 3 features for finger print recognition and identification. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) standard for finger print resolution for Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) is 500 pixels per inch which is highly inadequate for capturing level 3 features. Increasing the scan resolution alone does not increase the performance of the system. In the proposed work <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges</b> and scars is extracted using Gabor filter technique which is combined with pores and ridges of Fingerprint. Geometric matching is performed for the level 3 features. Experiments conducted shows that the performance gain is 90 % and error rate is 2. 4571 % for the proposed model which outperforms the existing work with level 3 features: ridges and pores...|$|R

40|$|In Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), {{pre-processing}} of {{the image}} is a crucial process in deciding the quality and performance of the system. Pre-processing is consists many stages as Segmentation, Enhancement, Binarisation, and Thinning. In this segmentation {{is one of the}} steps of pre-processing which differentiate foreground and background region of fingerprint images. Segmentation is the separation of the fingerprint region or extraction of the presence of ridges from the background of the initial image. Segmentation is necessary because it constructs the region of interest from the input image, reduces the processing time, increases the recognition or matching process performance, and reduces the probability of false feature extraction. A 100 % accurate segmentation is always very difficult, especially in the very poor quality image or partial image filled with noise such as the presence of latent. Fingerprints are made of Ridge and Valley structure and their features are classified in three levels as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 Features are singular macro details like ridge pattern and ridge flows. Level 2 is ridge local features like ridge bifurcation and ridge ending or simply minutiae points or ridge orientation. Level 3 is micro details like sweat pores, <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges.</b> This paper provides an overview {{of the state of the}} art techniques of fingerprint image segmentation and contribution of other researchers on segmentation.

40|$|Automatic {{fingerprint}} identification systems (AFIS) {{have for}} a long time used only minutiae for fingerprint matching. But minutiae are only a small subset of fingerprint detail routinely used by latent examiners for fingerprint matching. This has generated {{a lot of interest in}} extended feature set (EFS) with the aim of narrowing down the gap between the performance of AFIS and latent examiners. Level 3 features constitute the most significant subset of extended features. Studies on level 3 features have reported significant improvement in the fingerprint recognition accuracy. However, these studies were based either on live-scan fingerprints or full (rolled or slap) fingerprints. As a result, the conclusions of these studies cannot be extended to latent fingerprints, which are characterized by small size, poor image quality, and severe distortion compared to full fingerprints. In this paper, we study the utility of level 3 features, including pores, dots, <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges,</b> and ridge edge protrusions, for latent matching. Automatic algorithms for extracting and matching these features are proposed. While most existing level 3 feature matching algorithms only consider the locations of features, the proposed method utilizes the topological relationship between level 3 and level 2 features, and is thus robust to nonlinear distortion and has high discriminative capability. Given the proposed algorithms and operational latent fingerprint databases, we identify the challenges in using level 3 features, and show the potential of level 3 features in improving latent matching accuracy. Further, by using simulated partial fingerprints, we highlight that level 3 features can indeed improve latent matching accuracy when i) level 3 features can be reliably extracted in both latent and full fingerprints and ii) latent fingerprints have only a small number of minutiae or the minutiae match scores are low. With the increasing adoption of 1000 ppi fingerprint scanners in law enforcement agencies, it is becoming feasible and desirable to incorporate level 3 features into AFIS. We believe that the proposed algorithms and analysis will be useful in the design and development of next generation AFIS...|$|R

40|$|Migrating and <b>incipient</b> <b>ridges</b> {{and triple}} {{junctions}} sample the heterogeneous mantle created by plate tectonics and crustal stoping. The {{result is a}} yo-yo vertical convection mode that fertilizes, cools, and removes heat from the mantle. This mode of mantle convection {{is similar to the}} operation of a Galileo thermometer (GT). The GT mode of small-scale convection, as applied to the mantle, differs from the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability of a homogeneous fluid in a thermal boundary layer. It involves stoping of over-thickened continental crust and the differences in density and melting behavior of eclogites and peridotites in the mantle. The fates of subducted and delaminated crust, underplated basalt, and peridotite differ because of differences in scale, age, temperature, melting temperature, chemistry, thermal properties, and density. Cold subducted oceanic crust—as eclogite—although denser than ambient mantle at shallow depths, may become less dense or neutrally buoyant somewhere in the upper mantle and transition zone, and may be gravitationally trapped to form mafic eclogite-rich blobs or layers. Detached lower continental crust starts out warmer; it thermally and gravitationally equilibrates at shallower depths than do slabs of cold mature lithosphere. The density jumps at the depths of 400 and 650 km act as barriers. Trapped eclogite is heated by conduction from the surrounding mantle and its own radioactivity. It is displaced, entrained, and melted as it warms up to ambient mantle temperature. Both the foundering and the re-emergence of mafic and ultramafic blobs create midplate magmatism and uplift. Mantle upwellings and partially molten blobs need not be hotter than ambient mantle or from a deep thermal boundary layer. The fertile blobs drift slowly in the opposite direction to plate motions—the counterflow model—thereby maintaining age progressions and small relative motions between hotspots. Large-scale midplate volcanism is due to mantle fertility anomalies, such as large chunks of delaminated crust or subducted seamount chains, or to the release of accumulated underplate when the plate experiences flexure or pre-breakup extension. Eclogite can have lower shear velocities than volatile-free peridotite and will show up in seismic tomograms as low-velocity, or red, regions, even when cold and dense. This model removes the paradoxes associated with deep thermal RT instabilities, propagating cracks and small-scale thermal convection. It explains such observations as relative fixity of melting spots, even though the fertile blobs are shallow...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{compositions}} of the plagioclase-bearing ultramafic tectonites dredged and cored seaward of {{the continental}} slope of the Galicia margin (Leg 103, Site 637) were compared to mineral compositions from onshore low-pressure ultramafic bodies (southeastern Ronda, western Pyrenees, and Lizard Point), {{on the basis of}} standardized (30 -s counting time) probe analyses. The comparison was extended to some plagioclase-free harzburgites related to ophiolites (Santa Elena in Costa Rica, north Oman, and the Humboldt body in New Caledonia) on the basis of new analytical data and data from the literature. The behavior of Cr, Na, Al, Mg, Fe, Ni, and Ti in olivine, pyroxenes, and spinel was examined in order to distinguish between the effects of partial melting and mineral facies change, from the spinel to plagioclase stability fields. The peridotite from the Galicia margin appears slightly depleted in major incompatible elements and experienced a minor partial melting. However, it experienced large scale but heterogeneous recrystallization in the plagioclase field. These features are very similar to those observed in Ronda, whereas in the western Pyrenees the minerals exemplify a very minor partial-melting event (or none at all) and have retained compositions corresponding to those of the relatively high-pressure Seiland sub facies. The minerals from the Lizard Point peridotite have characteristics (low Mg/(Mg + Fe) ratio; high Cr/(Cr + Al) ratio in spinel) more related to cumulate from a differentiated tholeiitic melt than related to ophiolitic tectonite. Diffusion profiles of Al and Cr across pyroxenes and spinel show that recrystallization features occurred at different speeds or temperatures in the different bodies. The pyroxenes from Ronda would have experienced recrystallization about 14 times faster than the peridotite from the Galicia margin. The western Pyrenean lherzolites also experienced rapid recrystallization; nevertheless, because they are of a different mineral facies, the data are not directly comparable to that from Ronda and Galicia. The harzburgite at Santa Elena as well as a xenolith from alkali basalt exemplify rapid cooling characterized by very weak re-equilibration. Recrystallization speed is related to emplacement speed in the present geological environment. The slow-rising Galicia margin peridotite was emplaced by thinning of the lithospheric subcontinental mantle near an <b>incipient</b> mid-oceanic <b>ridge.</b> The fast-rising peridotites from Ronda and the western Pyrenees were hot diapirs emplaced from the asthenosphere along transcurrent faults, possibly related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
