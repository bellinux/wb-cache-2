The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
5|$|The audio dramas were {{originally}} published as three CD albums by 5pb. between March and June 2010, and were later collected {{along with other}} Steins;Gate material in a 2016 box set. They feature voice acting by the cast from the Steins;Gate game, and music and cover art by the game's composer Takeshi Abo and character designer Huke, respectively. The dramas were well received by critics and popular with fans, leading {{to the creation of}} manga and light novel adaptations. They were also used as the base for the Epigraph Trilogy of light novels and the Steins;Gate 0 video game. The trilogy was recorded in Japanese, but the third drama has <b>gotten</b> <b>an</b> English fan translation.|$|E

25|$|When Summitt {{was in high}} school, {{her family}} moved to nearby Henrietta, so she could play {{basketball}} in Cheatham County because Clarksville {{did not have a}} girls team. From there, Summitt went to University of Tennessee at Martin where {{she was a member of}} Chi Omega Sorority and won All-American honors, playing for UT–Martin's first women's basketball coach, Nadine Gearin. In 1970, with the passage of Title IX still two years away, there were no athletic scholarships for women. Each of Summitt's brothers had <b>gotten</b> <b>an</b> athletic scholarship, but her parents had to pay her way to college. She later co-captained the United States women's national basketball team as a player at the inaugural women's tournament in the 1976 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. Eight years later in 1984, she coached the U.S. women's team to an Olympic gold medal, becoming the first U.S. Olympian to win a basketball medal and coach a medal-winning team.|$|E
500|$|The 1948 Detroit Tigers {{season began}} with Houtteman in the {{starting}} rotation. Things started off poorly, however, as Houtteman lost his first eight decisions. Two of the first five losses, though, were by one run, and he had little run support. The 0–8 start and lack of run support led to his being called [...] "Hard Luck Houtteman" [...] in the media. His first victory that year came against the Senators, in which he also drove in the winning run. After winning his next start, he defeated the Philadelphia Athletics allowing only five hits, and avoided another loss. But he then lost eight more games and finished the season at 2–16. His teammates and the media attributed this to bad luck rather than bad pitching, and still regarded him as a prime prospect. Newhouser said, [...] "The kid has had nothing but bad luck since the season opened", while Fred Hutchinson said, [...] "He shouldn't have lost more than three or four games had he <b>gotten</b> <b>an</b> even break". But his 4.66 ERA was only 0.06 higher than the major league average.|$|E

Berger submitted his resignation to the SEC on May 15, 2006 and on June 1, 2006 became a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, where he continues to work.

2500|$|A Buffalo wing, hot wing or wing is {{a chicken}} wing section (drumette or flat) that is {{traditionally}} fried unbreaded and then coated in sauce. Classic Buffalo-style chicken wing sauce {{is composed of}} a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter. They are traditionally served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Buffalo wings get their name from where they were invented, at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York. In 1964, Teresa Bellissimo at the family-owned Anchor Bar, covered [...] chicken wings in her own special sauce and served them with a side of blue cheese and celery. In 1980, Frank Bellissimo, the husband of Teresa, told The New Yorker that her buffalo wings were invented out of necessity because the restaurant had <b>gotten</b> <b>an</b> overstock of chicken wings instead of other chicken parts that the couple didn't {{know what to do}} with. On the other hand, Dominic Bellissimo, the son of Frank and Teresa, disputed this story. Dominic claimed that the wings were an impromptu midnight snack that his mother created on his request while drinking with friends. Whatever the story, all of the Bellissimos have since died as {{there is no way to}} verify how buffalo wings were invented.|$|E
