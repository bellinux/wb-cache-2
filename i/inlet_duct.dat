25|$|The aircraft's most {{distinguishing}} feature is its dorsal-mounted variable-area <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> (VAID). While the VAID {{was at the}} time a system unique to the F-107A, it is now considered to be an early form of variable geometry intake ramp which automatically controlled the amount of air fed to the jet engine. Although the preliminary design of the air intake was originally located in a chin position under the fuselage like the Vought F-8 Crusader, the air intake was eventually mounted in an unconventional position directly above and just behind the cockpit. The VAID system proved to be very efficient and NAA used the design concept on their A-5 Vigilante, XB-70 Valkyrie and XF-108 Rapier designs.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> velocity.|$|E
25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} rigorous {{solutions for}} the problem of sound radiation from various <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts</b> including hyperboloidal (or hyperbolic) <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts</b> and circular ducts with wide flange. The numerical results include the complex conversion (or reflection) coefficients and the radiation directivity for the various incident wave modes - spinning modes as well as axisymmetric modes. The analysis utilizes hyperboloidal wave functions which are defined here as a class of eigensolutions of the wave equation for oblate spheroidal coordinates, and is valid for the whole frequency range including frequencies {{above and below the}} cutoff frequencies of duct modes involved...|$|R
25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central {{shock cone}} {{served as a}} compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|E
500|$|The F100-PW-220/220E was {{the result}} of the USAF's Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program (colloquially known as [...] "the Great Engine War"), which also saw the entry of General Electric as an F-16 engine provider. Its F110-GE-100 {{turbofan}} was limited by the original inlet to thrust of 25,735lbf (114.5kN), the Modular Common <b>Inlet</b> <b>Duct</b> allowed the F110 to achieve its maximum thrust of 28,984lbf (128.9kN). (To distinguish between aircraft equipped with these two engines and inlets, from the Block 30 series on, blocks ending in [...] "0" [...] (e.g., Block 30) are powered by GE, and blocks ending in [...] "2" [...] (e.g., Block 32) are fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines.) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{applications}} which stay relatively in {{the atmosphere}} and require longer durations of lower thrust over a specific speed range the air turborocket can have a weight advantage over the standard solid fuel rocket motor.

50|$|A {{bell-mouth}} <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> {{is a form}} of convergent {{inlet air}} duct used to direct air into the inlet of a gas turbine engine. The area of a convergent duct gets smaller as the air flows into the engine. A bell-mouth <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> is extremely efficient, and is used where there is little ram pressure available to force the air into the engine.

50|$|While the BE.52 was a {{self-contained}} power plant and lighter than Wibault's concept, the BE.52 was still complicated and heavy.

In the BE.53 the Olympus stages were fitted close to the Orpheus stages; thus simplifying the <b>inlet</b> <b>ducting.</b> The Olympus stages now supercharged the Orpheus core, improving the overall pressure ratio, creating what is now considered a conventional turbofan configuration.|$|R

50|$|For the 1964 model year, Ford {{introduced}} the two-door Fairlane 500 sedan-based Thunderbolt. Modified {{to accept a}} 427 high-riser engine, it featured a teardrop-shaped bubble hood to clear the induction system and drivetrain components from the larger Galaxie model. The two inner headlights were eliminated and replaced with air <b>inlets</b> <b>ducted</b> directly to the two four-barrel carbs.

However, the extensive modifications to the car did not meet Ford appearance quality standards.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, VarioRam varies the {{effective}} {{length of the}} <b>inlet</b> <b>ducting</b> depending upon engine load and speed. A long intake length at low rpm provides a better pulse tune because the pulse won't travel {{back and forth as}} many times, which aids low-end torque because the high pressure pulse may otherwise contribute to reversion and thereby decreased volumetric efficiency. At higher engine rpm, the intake length is reduced. The result is a flatter torque curve, with more torque available at low- and mid-range engine speeds compared to a similar non-VarioRam engine.|$|R

50|$|This high {{performance}} {{is due to}} the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine—the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved.

40|$|Direct {{calculation}} of the internal structure of a ducted noise source from farfield pressure measurements is regarded as an initial value problem, where the pressure and pressure gradient (farfield impedance) {{are assumed to be}} known along a line in the farfield. If pressure and impedance are known at the boundary of the farfield, the pressure can be uniquely determined {{in the vicinity of the}} inlet and inside the <b>inlet</b> <b>ducting.</b> A marching procedure is developed which, with this information obtained from measurements, enables a description of a ducted noise source.

40|$|The {{boundary}} layer control (BLC) {{system of the}} quiet short-haul research airplane (QSRA) requires significant amounts of pressurized airflow for successful operation.

40|$|Substantial {{reductions}} in aircraft size are possible if shorter, more aggressive, serpentine <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts</b> {{are used for}} low-observability constrained propulsion installations. To ob-tain this benet, both inlet separation and compressor stall dynamics must be controlled. In this paper the integrated control of this coupled inlet/compression system is consid-ered. Initial results are shown using separation point actu-ation to control both separation and stall dynamics. Calcu-lations show that separation can be substantially reduced with approximately 1. 2 % core flow, based on scaling pre-vious results. Simulation results using a medium delity model show that proportional control of distortion has lit-tle eect on stall behavior. ...|$|R
