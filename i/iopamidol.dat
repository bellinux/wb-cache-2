Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments.

40|$|AbstractA multicenter {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the incidence of adverse reactions to two contrast media with similar low osmolality during cardiac angiography. The study was of a randomized double-blind design comparing ioxaglate (an ionic dimer) and <b>iopamidol</b> (a nonionic compound) and included 500 patients; 250 patients received ioxaglate and 250 <b>iopamidol.</b> There were 58 adverse reactions attributed to the contrast media in the ioxaglate group and 29 in the <b>iopamidol</b> group (p < 0. 001). Chest pain occurred in 11 patients in the ioxaglate group compared with 5 in the <b>iopamidol</b> group (p = 0. 123). Nausea or vomiting was present in 20 and 2 patients, respectively (p < 0. 0003). Allergic adverse reactions, such as bronchospasm, urticaria and itching, occurred in 15 of the ioxaglate group and only 1 of the patients receiving <b>iopamidol</b> (p < 0. 0007). Fifty-two patients in the ioxaglate group had a known allergic history (not to contrast medium) or asthma, whereas 77 receiving <b>iopamidol</b> had a similar history. Seven of the 52 ioxaglate-treated patients developed an allergic adverse reaction compared {{with none of the}} 77 in the <b>iopamidol</b> group (p = 0. 091). Of 41 patients receiving ioxaglate who were premedicated with diphenhydramine, 4 had an allergic adverse event. In the <b>iopamidol</b> group 45 patients received similar premedication and none had an allergic adverse reaction (p < 0. 03). Thus, this multicenter study shows that adverse reactions occur more often with ioxaglate than with <b>iopamidol</b> and that patients with an allergic history have a greater risk with ioxaglate therapy compared with <b>iopamidol...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of <b>iopamidol,</b> a new nonionic radiocontrast agent, {{were evaluated}} in 10 patients undergoing lumbar myelography. The doses of <b>iopamidol</b> administered intrathe-cally were 11 and 15 ml of a 200 -mg iodine per ml solution in one and nine patients, respectively. Radiographs were made within 30 to 40 min and CTs were taken at about 1, 6, and 23 hr after <b>iopamidol</b> administration. The diagnostic quality and {{usefulness of the}} conventional and CT myelograms were considered excellent.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{report that}} <b>iopamidol</b> {{myelography}} can induce status epilepticus (SE) in patients carrying {{the diagnosis of}} symptomatic epilepsy and to estimate the incidence of seizures in patients undergoing <b>iopamidol</b> myelography. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients with seizures/SE associated with 1350 <b>iopamidol</b> myelographies during the last 5 years at our institution. The impact of cervical versus lumbar myelography was analysed. Results: Induced by <b>iopamidol</b> myelography two non-epileptic patients suffered from first generalised tonic-clonic seizures and a 67 -year-old women with symptomatic epilepsy after a remote ischemic stroke developed a generalised tonic-clonic seizure evolving into a dialeptic and right nystagmus SE (i. e. complex focal status) of 5 -hour duration. The incidence of seizures in non-epileptic patients was 0. 15 %. The incidence of seizure induction for lumbar myelography was lower than for myelographies that included the cervical subarachnoid space.

This {{study investigated the}} effects of low- vs iso-osmolar contrast medium (CM) exposure on NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by tubular cells. X-ray attenuation of iohexol, <b>iopamidol,</b> and iodixanol was assessed at equimolar iodine concentrations and their effects on human renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs) were evaluated with equally attenuating solutions of each CM. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis were investigated by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and annexin V/propidium iodide assay, respectively. ROS production was assessed by DCF assay, NADPH oxidase activity by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method, and Nox 4 expression by immunoblot. Yielding the same X-ray attenuation, CM cytotoxicity was assessed in PTCs at equimolar iodine concentrations. More necrosis was present after incubation with iohexol and <b>iopamidol</b> than after incubation with equal concentrations of iodixanol. Iohexol and iodixanol at low iodine concentrations induced less cytotoxicity than <b>iopamidol.</b> Moreover, both iohexol and <b>iopamidol</b> induced more apoptosis than iodixanol, with a dose-dependent effect. ROS generation was significantly higher with <b>iopamidol</b> and iohexol compared to iodixanol. NADPH oxidase activity and Nox 4 protein expression significantly increased after exposure to <b>iopamidol</b> and iohexol, with a dose-dependent effect, compared with iodixanol. CM-induced Nox 4 expression and activity depended upon Src activation. In conclusion, at angiographic concentrations, iodixanol induces fewer cytotoxic effects on cultured tubular cells than iohexol and <b>iopamidol</b> along with a lower induction of Nox 4 -dependent ROS generation. This enzyme may, thus, represent a potential therapeutic target to prevent iodinated CM-related oxidative stress...|$|E

We utilized the iopamidol-induced contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) rat model which was induced by a single dose of <b>iopamidol</b> (2. 9 Â g iodine/kg) and a cell model in which human embryonic proximal tubular (HK 2) cells were treated with <b>iopamidol.</b> The rats were divided into five groups: (1) control rats (CR); (2) atorvastatin (CA); (3) <b>iopamidol</b> (CM); (4) <b>iopamidol</b> and atorvastatin (20 Â mg/kgÂ d) (CMA 2); (5) <b>iopamidol</b> and atorvastatin (40 Â mg/kgÂ d) (CMA 4). On days 1, 2 and 6 after <b>iopamidol</b> injection, the urea nitrogen and cystatin C increased in CM compared with CR but decreased in CMA compared with CM.

We also found that atorvastatin ameliorated the renal tubular necrosis, apoptosis, and the deterioration of renal function in a dose dependent manner (PÂ <Â  0. 05). Furthermore, inÂ vivo, both of SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor) and SB 203580 (p 38 inhibitor) could decrease the expression of Bax and caspase- 3, but increase Bcl- 2 levels in HK 2 cells treated with <b>iopamidol.</b> Our study demonstrates that high-dosage atorvastatin treatment attenuates both the inflammatory processes and apoptosis in contrast-induced acute kidney injury, and that the JNK/p 38 MAPK pathway participates in the contrast-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells.

40|$|The hemodynamic and {{electrophysiologic}} alterations {{induced by}} ionic contrast agents during cardiac angiography are well described. Recently nonionic contrast agents have become available for cardiac angiography. To evaluate {{the safety of}} these new agents, a doubleblind randomized study was performed comparing a new nonionic agent (<b>iopamidol)</b> with a commonly used ionic contrast agent (Renografin- 76). Eighty-one patients undergoing left ventriculography and coronary angiography were included; 41 received <b>iopamidol</b> and 40 received sodium meglumine diatrizoate (Renografin- 76). After left ventriculography, there was {{a decrease in the}} arterial pressure with both contrast agents. However, the severity and the duration of hypotension were both significantly greater with Renografin- 76 compared with the new nonionic agent (p < 0. 001). After selective injections of the coronary arteries, electrocardiographic analysis demonstrated that the increase in the QT interval (p < 0. 0002) and the changes in both the ST segment and T wave amplitude (p < 0. 001) were significantly greater in the Renografin- 76 group compared with the <b>iopamidol</b> group.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the adverse effects of {{iodixanol}} and <b>iopamidol</b> in terms of patient's discomfort in subjects undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of all successful CAS procedures performed in our department during a 15 -year period study. All patients judged to be collaborative were included. From December 2000 to December 2005, we adopted <b>iopamidol</b> as contrast media (CM), thereafter iodixanol. Any transient unpleasant sensation of bitter taste or warmth perceived by the patient after intra-arterial injection of CM was recorded. Injection-associated discomfort was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) score. Comparison between the 2 CMs with regard to the overall discomfort was carried out by using the MannÃ¢ 8 Ì 09 Ì 3 Whitney test. Spearman correlation was performed to assess the correlation among discomfort, age, and CM used. A univariate analysis was performed for slightly bitter taste and warmth sensation to compare these clinical outcomes and CM used; subsequently, a logistic multivariate analysis regression was performed with the Ã¢ 8 Ì 09 Ìcbackward elimination. Ã¢ 8 Ì 09 Ìd Results Data from 1, 633 patients were evaluated. A total of 608 patients underwent CAS procedure using <b>iopamidol,</b> and 1, 025 using iodixanol. The total amount of CM used during a single procedure was 85 ÃÂ ÃÂ±ÃÂ  17 ÃÂ mL/patient (range 60 Ã¢ 8 Ì 09 Ì 3135). The median VAS value was statistically significantly lower in the iodixanol group than in the <b>iopamidol</b> group (PÃÂ <ÃÂ  0. 001). A significant Spearman correlation coefficient was found between age and discomfort for both CMs used (Spearman rho 0. 18 for iodixanol, 0. 17 for <b>iopamidol).</b> The univariate analysis showed that patients undergoing CAS with <b>iopamidol</b> had an odds ratio (OR) of 8. 48 (PÃÂ <ÃÂ  0. 001) to perceive warmth sensation. When adjusted for age and gender, the multivariate analysis still showed an OR of 8. 03. For slightly bitter taste sensation, the crude analysis showed an OR of 1. 31 (PÃÂ =ÃÂ  0. 018); adjusting for age and gender, OR became 1. 15 and the difference was not statistically significant (PÃÂ =ÃÂ  0. 257). Conclusions During CAS, less overall discomfort was reported in patients receiving iodixanol than iopamidol; in terms of warmth sensation, patients undergoing procedure using <b>iopamidol</b> as CM have a higher risk to perceive this clinical symptom than iodixanol.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperattenuated {{cerebral}} {{areas on}} postinterventional CT {{are a common}} finding after endovascular stroke treatment. There is uncertainty {{about the extent to}} which these hyperattenuated areas correspond to hemorrhage or contrast agent that extravasated into infarcted parenchyma during angiography. We evaluated whether it is possible to distinguish contrast extravasation from blood on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the influence of iodinated contrast agents on T 1, T 2, and T 2 * and magnetic susceptibility in a phantom model and an ex vivo animal model. We determined T 1, T 2, and T 2 * relaxation times and magnetic susceptibility of <b>iopamidol</b> and iopromide in dilutions of 1 : 1; 1 : 2; 1 : 4; 1 : 10; and 1 : 100 with physiologic saline solution. We then examined the appearance of intracerebral <b>iopamidol</b> on MR imaging in an ex vivo animal model. To this end, we injected <b>iopamidol</b> into the brain of a deceased swine. RESULTS: <b>Iopamidol</b> and iopromide cause a negative susceptibility shift and T 1, T 2, and T 2 * shortening. The effects, however, become very small in dilutions of 1 : 10 and higher. Undiluted <b>iopamidol,</b> injected directly into the brain parenchyma, did not cause visually distinctive signal changes on T 1 -weighted spin-echo, T 2 -weighted turbo spin-echo, and T 2 *-weighted gradient recalled-echo imaging. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that iodinated contrast agents extravasated into infarcted brain parenchyma cause signal changes that mimic hemorrhage on T 1 WI, T 2 WI, and T 2 *WI.

A total of 20 patients (8. 5 %) had major and 143 (61 %) had minor adverse events with diatrizoate use; 10 patients (4. 8 %) had major and 53 (25 %) had minor adverse events with <b>iopamidol</b> (p = 0. 12 for major events; p < 0. 0001 for total events). Most adverse events were treated fairly easily and inexpensively. The median overall cost was $ 186 higher for patients after <b>iopamidol</b> use compared with diatrizoate (p < 0. 0001), but all costs except the cost of the contrast agent were not significantly different between the two groups. Thus, patients who received <b>iopamidol</b> for cardiac angiography had a significantly lower rate of adverse events than those who received diatrizoate, but this difference was achieved at a considerably high overall cost...|$|E
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{injuries}} {{induced by}} intravascular administration of radiographic contrast agents may be clinically {{relevant to the}} development of thrombosis and platelet activation. In this connection, we investigated the in vitro effects induced by iodamide, <b>iopamidol,</b> and ioxaglate on vascular endothelial ADPase activity and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in bovine aortic endothelium, in order to extend knowledge required to evaluate endothelial compatibility of radiographic contrast media. Undiluted and Tris-diluted contrast agent formulations were employed, and mannitol and sucrose hyperosmolar solutions were used as comparison. Results demonstrated that the high-osmolar ionic contrast agent iodamide, and to a lesser extent, the low-osmolar nonionic agent <b>iopamidol,</b> stimulated endothelial ADPase activity of the aortic endothelium; the low-osmolar ionic agent ioxaglate left endothelial ADPase activity unchanged. Furthermore, the diluted formulations of iodamide and <b>iopamidol,</b> as well as high-osmolar mannitol and sucrose solutions, were devoid of activity in ADPase. This suggests that the endothelial ADPase stimulation induced by both radiographic contrast media was a hyperosmolar-independent pharmacodynamic activity. <b>Iopamidol</b> and ioxaglate reduced endogenous t-PA release from bovine aortic endothelium only in undiluted formulation, while iodamide showed this inhibiting action in both diluted and undiluted formulations. No effect was observed when using mannitol solutions at different osmolarity values. Our in vitro findings agree with published data on the different thrombotic tendency attributed to the contrast agents used, suggesting endothelial enzymatic activities (ADPase and t-PA release) as suitable tools for evaluating endothelial vessel wall compatibility with radiographic contrast media...|$|E
30|$|Patientsâ TBW {{and height}} were {{registered}} in an electronic database. Moreover, a radiologist-driven dose of <b>iopamidol</b> (190 patients over 201) (Iopamiro 370; 370 mgI/mL; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) or iomeprol (11 patients over 201) (Iomeron 400; 400 mgI/mL; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) was administered. While <b>iopamidol</b> {{is the main}} choice in our hospital for routine abdomen and chest CT, iomeprol is used for cardiac CT. Due to practical reasons (storage lack of <b>iopamidol,</b> the necessity of employing an already-open CA bottle, examination acquired during a cardiac session), some patients received iomeprol. A total of eight radiologists {{were responsible for the}} examinations. The general rule established in the department for the CA dose to be administered for multiphasic abdominal CT was to use doses proportional to the TBW, multiplying the patient body weight by a constant, which varied from 1.1 to 1.3 Â mL/kg, with adjustments when the CA dose was considered too high. Radiologists usually adopted their own spontaneous threshold, without any agreement among them. Another heuristic rule used by some professionals was âpatient weight in millilitres plus 10 additional millilitres of CAâ.|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{relationship}} of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) to long-term adverse events (AEs) is controversial. Although an association with AEs {{has been previously}} reported, {{it is unclear whether}} CIN is causally related to these AEs. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We obtained long-term (> 1 yr) follow-up on 294 patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind comparison of two prevention strategies for CIN (<b>iopamidol</b> versus iodixanol). A difference in the incidence of AEs between patients who had developed CIN and those who had not was performed using a 2 test and Poisson regression analysis. A similar statistical approach was used for the differences in AEs between those who received <b>iopamidol</b> or iodixanol. Multiple definitions of CIN were used to strengthen and validate the results and conclusions. Results: The rate of long-term AEs was higher in individuals with CIN (all definitions of CIN). After adjustment for baseline comorbidities and risk factors, the adjusted incidence rate ratio for AEs was twice as high in those with CIN. Randomization to <b>iopamidol</b> reduced both the incidence of CIN and AEs...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of an ionic high osmolar {{contrast}} medium (Ioxitalamate), an ionic low osmolar contrast medium (Ioxaglate) and various nonionic low osmolar contrast media (<b>Iopamidol,</b> Iopromide and Iohexol) on thrombus growth in a rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. Thrombus growth {{was determined by the}} accretion of 125 I-labeled fibrinogen onto autologous preformed thrombi in rabbit jugular veins at various time-intervals from 15 min up to 10 h after infusion of the study solution. The ionic low osmolar contrast medium markedly inhibited thrombus growth whereas all nonionic low osmolar contrast media promoted thrombus growth. The ionic high osmolar, contrast medium inhibited thrombus growth, but less than the ionic low osmolar contrast medium. Within the group of nonionic contrast media, the <b>Iopamidol</b> associated promotion of thrombus growth was significantly higher than the Iopromide or Iohexol associated effects. The simultaneous administration of the apparently most potent thrombus growth promoting contrast medium (i. e. <b>Iopamidol)</b> and heparin resulted in complete abolishment of the increase in thrombus growth. These results support the claims of prothrombotic properties of nonionic as compared to ionic contrast media and could explain the clinically encountered thromboembolic complications after the use of nonionic low osmolar contrast medi...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{diagnostic}} efficacy and the clinical tolerance of iobitridol 300 was evaluated in 68 patients receiving intraarterial injection in 2 monocentric comparative randomized double-blind trials with iopromide 300 (30 patients) and <b>iopamidol</b> 300 (40 patients) as reference. RESULTS; There {{is no significant}} difference in quality of opacification or in {{diagnostic efficacy}} between the products in each trial. No major adverse reactions occurred after the injection of iobitridol 300. Excluding a heat sensation, 5 of the patients who received iobitridol had minor reactions consisting of nausea with vomiting and pain during the injection. Five patients in the reference group also experienced adverse events. CONCLUSION: Iobitridol is well tolerated after intraarterial administration and it has the same diagnostic quality as iopromide and <b>iopamidol.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Preoperative {{identification}} of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in gastric cancer (GC) patients may have great advantages for the minimally invasive treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the possibility of preoperative SLN detection using CT lymphography. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with early GC were enrolled. CT images were obtained before and at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after endoscopic submucosal peritumoral injection of 2 mL <b>iopamidol.</b> For patients with clearly identified SLNs, to make comparisons with the CT lymphography results, intraoperative SLN detection was performed using subserosally injected Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography and ex vivo ICG and <b>iopamidol</b> lymphography using mammography was also performed. Results: CT lymphography clearly visualized draining lymphatics and SLNs in 4 (28. 6 %) out of 14 patients. All clearly visualized SLNs (one to three SLNs per patient) under preoperative imaging were detected in the same location by intraoperative ICG lymphography and ex vivo ICG and <b>iopamidol</b> lymphography using mammography. All preoperative SLN detections were observed with the primary tumors in the lower third of the stomach. Conclusion: Although our study demonstrated a SLN detection rate of less than 30 %, CT lymphography with radio-contrast showed potential {{as a method of}} preoperative SLN detection for GC...|$|E
40|$|This randomised, double-blind, {{parallel}} group {{study was}} to compare the safety, tolerance and diagnostic efficacy of iomeprol and <b>iopamidol,</b> both at an iodine concentration of 150 mgI/ml, in 40 patients with arterial hypertension who required renal intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) for suspected renovascular stenosis. All patients underwent extensive pre- and post-contrast clinical, instrumental and laboratory controls for safety assessments. The tolerance to the test contrast media was evaluated in terms of discomfort associated with the injection of the test compounds. Image quality was prospectively graded by two independent readers according to a five-point scale as follows: 1, insufficient; 2, sufficient; 3, good; 4, excellent; E, excessive. The quality of vascular opacification {{in the region of}} interest was rated as diagnostic in 87. 8 % of radiographs obtained in the iomeprol group and in 84. 5 % in the <b>iopamidol</b> group, without {{significant differences between the two}} study groups. The results of angiography were always useful for subsequent patient management. The procedure was always well tolerated. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG and laboratory parameters during the study in both groups. The results of our study show that iomeprol 150 mgI/ml, and <b>iopamidol</b> 150 mgI/ml are equally effective, well tolerated and safe contrast agents when used for IA-DSA...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} a widely used nontunneled triple-lumen {{central venous catheter}} {{in order to determine}} whether the largest of the three lumina (16 gauge) can tolerate high flow rates, such as those required for computed tomographic angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two catheters were tested in vitro, including 10 new and 32 used catheters (median indwelling time, 5 days). Injection pressures were continuously monitored {{at the site of the}} 16 -gauge central venous catheter hub. Catheters were injected with 300 and 370 mg of iodine per milliliter of <b>iopamidol</b> by using a mechanical injector at increasing flow rates until the catheter failed. The infusion rate, hub pressure, and location were documented for each failure event. The catheter pressures generated during hand injection by five operators were also analyzed. Mean flow rates and pressures at failure were compared by means of two-tailed Student t test, with differences considered significant at P <. 05. RESULTS: Injections of <b>iopamidol</b> with 370 mg of iodine per milliliter generate more pressure than injections of <b>iopamidol</b> with 300 mg of iodine per milliliter at the same injection rate. All catheters failed in the tubing external to the patient. The lowest flow rate at which catheter failure occurred was 9 mL/sec. The lowest hub pressure at failure was 262 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for new and 213 psig for used catheters. Hand injection of <b>iopamidol</b> with 300 mg of iodine per milliliter generated peak hub pressures ranging from 35 to 72 psig, corresponding to flow rates ranging from 2. 5 to 5. 0 mL/sec. CONCLUSION: Indwelling use has an effect on catheter material property, but even for used catheters there is a substantial safety margin for power injection with the particular triple-lumen central venous catheter tested in this study, as the manufacturer's recommendation for maximum pressure is 15 psig...|$|E
40|$|Within 20 months 145 {{ascending}} thoracocervical myelogra-phies and 155 lumbar myelographies {{with the}} non ionic water-soluble contrast medium <b>iopamidol</b> were performed. The iodine concentration given was 250 mg Ilml or 200 mg Ilml respec-tively. The total iodine never exceeded 2. 5 g (8 - 10 ml).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct {{volume and}} {{intracranial}} hemorrhage after reperfusion with nonionic low-osmolar and iso-osmolar iodinated IRCM {{has not been}} previously compared. We postulated that iso-osmolar and low-osmolar iodinated contrast media exert varied effects on cerebral infarct after intra-arterial injection. We compared infarct volume and hemorrhagic changes following intra-arterial infusion of iodixanol, <b>iopamidol,</b> or normal saline in a rat MCA occlusion/reperfusion model. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Infarct was induced in 30 rats by a previously validated method of MCA suture occlusion. Reperfusion was performed after 5 hours with either iodixanol (n 9), <b>iopamidol</b> (n 12), or saline (n 9). MR images were obtained at both 6 and 24 hours after ischemia, followed by sacrifice.
