40|$|As {{radar and}} {{communication}} systems both are RF systems, {{a combination of}} both may be possible. The communication channel between transmitter and receiver is modeled and then adapted to include a rotating narrowbeam antenna, common to radar systems, located at the transmitter side. Assuming an omnidirectional antenna at the receiving station, this channel model can help to understand the similarities, differences and possibilities of the combination of radar and communication. Then the channel capacity is analyzed using this system setup. Whether this channel capacity can be approached or not depends on the channel realization and the possible presence of Doppler. Further, this paper will discuss the effects of Doppler and a possible solution to deal with the resulting reduction in performance. Finally, the <b>effective</b> <b>beamwidth</b> of the narrow beampattern is determined, using the channel model and assuming the receiver deals with the channel (and Doppler shifts) perfectly.

40|$|Tissue Harmonic Imaging (THI) and Pulse Inversion (PI) Harmonic Imaging {{exploit the}} {{harmonics}} generated {{as a result}} of nonlinear propagation through tissue to improve the performance of imaging systems. A 3 D finite difference model, that solves the KZK equation in the frequency domain, is used to investigate the finite amplitude fields produced by rectangular transducers driven with short pulses and their inverses, in water and homogeneous tissue. This enables the characteristic of the fields and the effective PI field to be calculated. The suppression of the fundamental field in PI is monitored, and the suppression of side lobes and a reduction in the <b>effective</b> <b>beamwidth</b> for each field are calculated. In addition, the differences between the pulse and inverse pulse spectra resulting from the use of very short pulses are noted, and the differences in the location of the fundamental and second harmonic spectral peaks observed...|$|E
40|$|Errors in {{binary star}} separations {{estimated}} by model-fitting visibilities {{obtained from a}} two-element interferometer are discussed. It is shown that the rms error on any component of a binary star's separation in the sky is linearly proportional to the rms noise in the observed visibilities, and linear proportional to an <b>effective</b> <b>beamwidth</b> for the observation. It varies inversely with the peak-to-peak variation of the visibility of the binary {{that depends on the}} ratio of the intensities of the two stars and inversely as the square root {{of the total number of}} observed visibilities. It is also shown that, in principle, any visibility data set can be consistent with more than one binary separation and orientation. This leads to alternative solutions for the binary separation vector. The alternative solutions are equally spaced on a straight line in binary separation space. This line, when projected onto the equatorial plane, is parallel to the projection of the physical baseline onto the same plane...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThis paper {{details the}} {{interaction}} of a small satellite with a space network and estimates the number of contacts and duration of contacts between the small, spin-stabilized satellite and a TDRS satellite. The simulations were performed using Satellite Tool Kit (STK) version 3. 0, an orbital analysis software program. STK was configured for the four vehicles representing the spin-stabilized satellite and three TDRS satellites, TDRS East, West, and TDRS Zone of Exclusion. A set of simulations were run in which the spinstabilized satellite was given orbital elements corresponding to an orbital altitude between 600 km and 1200 km. The orbital inclination angle for the set of simulations was also varied from 20 ° through 100 ° along with the antenna cone angle of 10 ° through 40 ° {{to account for the}} <b>effective</b> <b>beamwidths.</b> In each of the simulations, the access to each TDRS satellite in the SN constellation was examined as a function of orbital altitude, orbital inclination angle, and antenna cone angle...|$|R
40|$|The {{cross-range}} resolution of forward-looking phase array radar (PAR) {{is limited by}} the <b>effective</b> antenna <b>beamwidth</b> since the azimuth echo is the convolution of antenna pattern and targets’ backscattering coefficients. Therefore, deconvolution algorithms are proposed to improve the imaging resolution under the limited antenna beamwidth. However, as a typical inverse problem, deconvolution is essentially a highly ill-posed problem which is sensitive to noise and cannot ensure a reliable and robust estimation. In this paper, multi-channel deconvolution is proposed for improving the performance of deconvolution, which intends to considerably alleviate the ill-posed problem of single-channel deconvolution. To depict the performance improvement obtained by multi-channel more effectively, evaluation parameters are generalized to characterize the angular spectrum of antenna pattern or singular value distribution of observation matrix, which are conducted to compare different deconvolution systems. Here we present two multi-channel deconvolution algorithms which improve upon the traditional deconvolution algorithms via combining with multi-channel technique. Extensive simulations and experimental results based on real data are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed imaging methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the radio remnant of SN 1987 A has been followed using the Australia Telescope Compact Array since its first detection in 1990 August. The remnant has been observed at four frequencies, 1. 4, 2. 4, 4. 8 and 8. 6 GHz, at intervals of 4 - 6 weeks since the first detection. These data are combined with the 843 MHz data set of Ball et al. (2001) obtained at Molonglo Observatory to study the spectral and temporal variations of the emission. These observations show that the remnant continues to increase in brightness, with a larger rate of increase at recent times. They also show that the radio spectrum is becoming flatter, with the spectral index changing from - 0. 97 to - 0. 88 over the 11 years. In addition, at roughly yearly intervals since 1992, the remnant has been imaged at 9 GHz using super-resolution techniques to obtain an <b>effective</b> synthesised <b>beamwidth</b> of about 0 ". 5. The imaging observations confirm the shell-morphology of the radio remnant and show that it continues to expand at ~ 3000 km/s. The bright regions of radio emission seen on the limb of the shell {{do not appear to}} be related to the optical hotspots which have subsequently appeared in surrounding circumstellar material.

40|$|To make {{a double}} CubeSat with limited power {{resources}} capable of transmitting {{large amounts of}} data to Earth a high gain antenna is needed. In this thesis a switched beam MSA array operating at 5. 84 GHz {{has been designed to}} operate on a double CubeSat. The array has 5 beams and uses a switched-line phase shifter to switch between beams. Three different array geometries has been proposed. Computer simulations suggest that the array should be capable of an <b>effective</b> <b>beamwidth</b> of over 60 degrees with a directivity of over 11 dBi. A feed network has been designed to fit the best suited geometry. A ground plane will separate the feed network from the antenna elements. Along with the full array solution all the sub parts has been realized as test circuits. This allows for an evaluation of their characteristics. A TRL calibration kit has also been designed so that the sub parts could be more accurately evaluated. When sending the circuits to fabrication it appeared to be a problem with the selected substrate used for the antenna elements. A redesign using the same substrate for the feed network and antennas was done and production commenced. As it turns out, the TRL calibration kit was not good enough so the S-parameters had to be measured with regular SOLT calibration. Significant problems with connection to ground and mismatches due to a poor SMA-to-microstrip transition was encountered. This caused large deviations between measured and simulated results. It was also discovered that the wrong dielectric constant had been used. This error caused the antenna elements to be dimensioned for operation at 5. 70 GHz instead of 5. 84 GHz. Problems was also encountered in the switched line phase shifter design. Beam-lead PIN-diodes has been used and due to their small size, a sufficient quality of the soldering was not achieved. This lead to different losses through the phase shifter which again caused the different beam directions to vary from simulations. Only one beam had characteristics similar to simulations. Measurements on the array without phase shifters showed good correspondence with simulation results (adjusted for the correct dielectric constant). It is concluded that by making a better SMA-to-microstrip transition, improve the soldering work and do a redesign with the correct dielectric constant, the array configuration should work as outlined in the design process. </p...|$|E
