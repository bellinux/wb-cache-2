2500|$|Nutcracker esophagus, or {{hypertensive}} peristalsis, is {{a disorder}} {{of the movement}} of the esophagus characterized by contractions in the smooth muscle of the esophagus in a normal sequence but at an excessive amplitude or duration. Nutcracker esophagus is one of several motility disorders of the esophagus, including achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm. [...] It causes difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, to both solid and liquid foods, and can cause significant chest pain; it may also be asymptomatic. [...] Nutcracker esophagus can affect people of any age, but is more common in the sixth and seventh decades of life. [...] The diagnosis is made by an esophageal motility study (<b>esophageal</b> <b>manometry),</b> which evaluates the pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length.

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine their frequency and their cause. Among 77 consecutive <b>esophageal</b> <b>manometries</b> (group 1), 17 cases (22 %) of ‘esophageal high pressure zones’ (EHPZs) were recorded. Thirty-three additional patients (group 2) were evaluated and 18 other cases of EHPZ were found; in the latter group, a miniature sound microphone was positioned on a carotid artery. When a high pressure zone was identified, the manometric catheter was immobilized; the patient underwent a chest x-ray, with the radiopaque marker imbedded in the catheter used to locate the thoracic structures adjacent to EHPZs. In both groups, indentations (pressure spikes) over the high pressure zones occurred synchronously with the patients’ radial or carotid pulse. Results suggest that EHPZs are caused by the compression and pulsations of vascular or cardiac periesophageal structures; the aortic arch is responsible for the manometric EHPZ when it is found between 10 and 14 [*]cm above the lower esophageal sphincter whereas the left auricle is the cause of the EHPZ if it is located between 4 and 7 [*]cm above the lower esophageal sphincter...|$|R

2500|$|Nutcracker {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} as a motility disorder of the esophagus, meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement, or peristalsis of the esophagus. Patients with motility disorders present with two key symptoms: either with chest pain (typically reported as non-cardiac chest pain as it is esophageal in origin), which is usually found in disorders of spasm, or with dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing). Nutcracker esophagus can present with either of these, but chest pain is the more common presentation. The chest pain is very severe and intense, and mimics cardiac chest pain. It may spread into the arm and back. The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent, and may occur with or without food. [...] Rarely, patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food (termed a food bolus obstruction, or the 'steakhouse syndrome') requiring urgent treatment.

Methods: 16 healthy volunteers without history of digestive complaints or esophageal symptoms were included. 22 -channel water-perfused high-resolution manometry was performed. Results: Normal values were calculated as 5 th- 95 th percentile ranges for the following parameters; upper esophageal sphincter resting pressure (UESRP) (40 - 195 mmHg); upper esophageal sphincter residual pressure (UESResP) (30 - 115 mmHg), contractile front velocity (CFV) (2. 4 - 7. 1 cm/s), distal contractile integral (DCI) (285 - 2820 mmHg. s. cm), distal contraction latency (DL) (6. 1 - 10. 9 s), intrabolus pressure (IBP) (7 - 19 mmHg), integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4 s) (2 - 20 mmHg), lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure (LESRP) (5 - 54 mmHg), esophageal shortening (Es) (0. 3 - 1. 3 cm) and lower esophageal sphincter lift (LESL) (0, 1 - 1, 2 cm).

40|$|Background/Aims: Nutcracker {{esophagus}} and non-specific motility {{disorders are}} the main causes of non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP), with gastroesophageal reflux in 60 % of cases. Achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm are the most frequent anomalies described in patients with dysphagia. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the occurrence of esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter motor abnormalities in patients with dysphagia, NCCP, or both. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of 716 patients with NCCP and/or dysphagia tested between January 1994 and December 2010. 1023 functional studies were performed, 707 of which were <b>esophageal</b> <b>manometries,</b> 225 <b>esophageal</b> pH-meters, and 44 bilimetries. We divided the patients into three groups: group 1 was composed of patients affected with dysphagia, group 2 with NCCP and group 3 with NCCP and dysphagia. Results: Manometric anomalies were detected in 84. 4 % of cases (p< 0. 001). The most frequent esophageal motility alteration was achalasia (36 %). The lower esophageal sphincter was normal in 45. 9 % of patients (p< 0. 001). In all 3 groups, 80. 9 %, 98. 8 %, and 93. 8, respectively, of patients showed normal upper esophageal sphincter (p= 0. 005). Conclusion: Our data differs from those of other studies because they were collected from and analyzed by a single tertiary level referral center by a single examiner.

Criteria for tLESRs were defined by characterizing spontaneous LES relaxation associated with common cavity, and then applied to all spontaneous LES relaxations.

40|$|Copyright Summary © 2008 We JCBN {{reviewed}} the recent literature concerning investigations of esophageal peristaltic function. The {{gold standard for}} the assessment of esophageal peristaltic function is manometry with pH monitoring. Even with this investigation modality, however, we are in fact doing no more than estimating esophageal peristaltic function from the manometry and pH results. With esophageal fluoroscopy and scintigraphy, where we observe esophageal motility, there are problems with radiation exposure and handling of radioactive agents that make widespread use difficult. In recent years, the development of multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) manometry has allowed simultaneous measurement of intraesophageal pressure and assessment of esophageal peristalsis. Using MII it is also possible to distinguish whether gas or liquid is passing down the esophagus. When manometry is performed in conjunction with transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy, with this unique combination it is possible to measure the intraesophageal pressure while actually observing the swallowing motion at the same time. Assessment of esophageal peristaltic function is now moving from simple measurement of intraesophageal pressure to simultaneous impedance manometry and endoscopic observation of esophageal peristalsis itself.

The study found that children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, {{the disappearance of the}} parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high or slow EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula/pressure transducer system and/or <b>esophageal</b> <b>manometry,</b> which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement.|$|E

METHODS: The study included 111 patients (54 % male) with recurrent angina-like chest pain, non-responsive to therapy with proton pump inhibitors. Sixty-five (59 %) had non-obstructive lesions in coronary artery angiography, and in 46 (41 %) significant coronary artery narrowing was found. In all patients, 24 -h <b>esophageal</b> pH-metry and <b>manometry,</b> and treadmill stress tests with simultaneous <b>esophageal</b> pH-metry and <b>manometry</b> monitoring were performed. During a 24 -h examination the percentage of spontaneous chest pain (sCP) episodes associated with acid reflux or dysmotility (symptom index, SI) was calculated. Patients with SI > 50 % for acid gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were classified as having GER-related sCP. The remaining symptomatic individuals were determined as having non-GER-related sCP. During the stress test, the occurrence of chest pain, episodes of esophageal acidification (pH < 4 for 10 s) and esophageal spasm with more than 55 % of simultaneous contractions (exercise-provoked esophageal spasm or EPES) were noted. RESULTS: Sixty-eight (61 %) individuals reported sCP during 24 -h esophageal function monitoring. Eleven of these (16 %) were classified as having GER-related sCP and 53 / 68 (84 %) as having non-GER-related sCP. The exercise-provoked chest pain during a stress test occurred in 13 / 111 (12 %) subjects. In order to compare the clinical usefulness of 24 -h esophageal function monitoring and its examination limited only to the treadmill stress test, the standard parameters of diagnostic test evaluation were determined. The occurrence of GER-related or non-GER-related sCP was assumed as a “gold standard”. Afterwards, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. These parameters expressed a prediction of GER-related or non-GER-related sCP occurrence {{by the presence of}} chest pain, esophageal acidification and EPES. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of chest pain during the stress test predicting any sCP occurrence were 28 %, 35 % and 80 %, respectively, predicting GER-related sCP were 42 %, 0 % and 83 %, respectively, and predicting non-GER-related sCP were 57 %, 36 % and 83 %, respectively. Similar values were obtained for exercise-related acidification with pH < 4 longer than 10 s in the prediction of GER-related sCP (44 %, 36 % and 92 %, respectively) and EPES in relation to non-GER-related sCP (48 %, 23 % and 84 %, respectively).

Materials and methods: twelve healthy volunteers (5 males; 32. 6 ± 2. 0 years) underwent three <b>esophageal</b> sleeve <b>manometry</b> studies after 3 days premedication with itopride 50 mg, itopride 100 mg or placebo t. i. d. Drug was administered after 30 minutes and a standardized meal was administered after 90 minutes, with measurements continuing to 120 minutes postprandially. Throughout the study, 10 wet swallows were administered at 30 -minute intervals, and gastrointestinal symptoms were scored on 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS) at 15 -minute intervals. Results: LES resting pressures, swallow-induced relaxations and the amplitude or duration of peristaltic contractions were not altered by both doses of itopride, at all time points. Itopride pretreatment inhibited the meal-induced rise of transient LES relaxations (TLESRs). Conclusions: Itopride inhibits TLESRs without significantly affecting esophageal peristaltic function or LES pressure. These observations support further studies with itopride in GERD...|$|R
