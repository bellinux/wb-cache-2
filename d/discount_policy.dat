50|$|<b>Discount</b> <b>policy</b> is policy {{taken by}} the central bank to {{increase}} and decrease the money circulation by raising or lowering bank rates. If the Central Bank raised bank rates, its aim {{to reduce the amount}} of money. With the high rates, people are expected to save their money in bank. Therefore, the amount of money will be reduced. Policy to raise bank rates is used to press inflation. Meanwhile, if the central bank lowers bank rates, its aim to increase the amount of money. With the low rates, people are expected to save their money in bank. Thus, the amount of money circulating in the society will increase. The decline in bank rates made by the Central Bank if the economy goes into a recession or if the economy is run into deflation.|$|E

30|$|Monahan (1984) {{demonstrated}} that the quantity discount offered by a vendor is able to induce the buyer to increase his order quantity. Recent researches, by considering this fact, have shown that this incentive tool {{could be used to}} coordinate SC decisions. Weng (1995) investigated a supplier–buyer system faced with the deterministic demand. It has been shown that a quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy</b> regardless of its form (incremental or all-unit <b>discount</b> <b>policy)</b> is an effective plan to induce the buyer to align its decision variables with the joint decision-making plan. Qi et al. (2004) investigated a supplier–retailer SC faced with the demand disruption during the planning horizon. They showed that a wholesale quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy</b> is able to revise the production plan and coordinate the SC. Li and Liu (2006) designed a wholesale quantity discount scheme under demand uncertainty to induce the retailer to increase its order quantity in a one-supplier one-retailer supply chain. They showed there is feasible solution that the supplier and retailer accept to participate in the joint decision making. Further, the authors designed a method to divide the increased profit raised from joint decision making between both sides of SC.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to deal with the supply chain {{management}} (SCM) with quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy</b> under the complex fuzzy environment, which is characterized as the bi-fuzzy variables. By taking into account the strategy and the process of decision making, a bi-fuzzy nonlinear multiple objective decision making (MODM) model is presented to solve the proposed problem. Design/methodology/approach: The bi-fuzzy variables in the MODM model are transformed into the trapezoidal fuzzy variables by the DMs's degree of optimism ? 1 and ? 2, which are de-fuzzified by the expected value index subsequently. For solving the complex nonlinear model, a multi-objective adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm (MO-APSO) is designed as the solution method. Findings: The proposed model and algorithm are applied to a typical example of SCM problem to illustrate the effectiveness. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the results, the bi-fuzzy nonlinear MODM SCM model is proved to be sensitive to the possibility level ? 1. Practical implications: The study focuses on the SCM under complex fuzzy environment in SCM, which has a great practical significance. Therefore, the bi-fuzzy MODM model and MO-APSO can be further applied in SCM problem with quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy.</b> Originality/value: The bi-fuzzy variable is employed in the nonlinear MODM model of SCM to characterize the hybrid uncertain environment, and this work is original. In addition, the hybrid crisp approach is proposed to transferred to model to an equivalent crisp one by the DMs's degree of optimism and the expected value index. Since the MODM model consider the bi-fuzzy environment and quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy,</b> so this paper has a great practical significance. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} analyzing the impact of joint decision policies on channel coordination in a system consisting of a supplier {{and a group of}} homogeneous buyers. The joint decision policy characterized by the unit selling price and the order quantity is coordinated through quantity discounts and franchise fees. Both the annual demand rate and the operating cost [...] -including the purchase, ordering, and inventory holding costs [...] -depend on the joint decision policy employed. This paper contributes by integrating work addressing quantity discounts on inventory and ordering policies and work focusing on the control mechanism provided by quantity discounts in channel coordination. It is shown that the optimal all-unit quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy</b> is equivalent to the optimal incremental quantity <b>discount</b> <b>policy</b> in achieving channel coordination. Furthermore, it is shown that quantity discounts alone are not sufficient to guarantee joint profit maximization. The analyses of the general models are illustrated by specific analytical results obtained for a given demand function. production/inventory, policies, pricing, deterministic models, marketing, pricing, price-sensitivity, purchasing...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} some extensions over a recent work in Won (2011) which investigates {{properties of the}} static newsvendor problem under a schedule involving progressive multiple discounts {{under the assumption that}} demand is given exogenously. Khouja (1995, 1996) formulated the extended versions over the classical newsvendor model with various <b>discount</b> <b>policies</b> including all-units <b>discount</b> and/or multiple discounts and found that the extended newsvendor models with discount schedules yield higher optimal expected profits than the classical newsvendor model with no-discounts. In this study, we establish a robust conjecture as a stronger statement than Khouja’s findings with regard to the general relationship among the expected profits of newsvendor models {{in the sense that the}} con-jecture holds for every order quantity as well as the optimal order quantity. The conjecture encourages the newsvendor facing quantity discounts to safely implement her own <b>discounts</b> <b>policy</b> to customer or accept quantity discounts offered by the supplier even if the optimal order quantity cannot be ordered due to additional restrictions such as budget or warehouse capacity constraints because the newsvendor models with quantity discounts always yield higher expected profit than the classic newsvendor model without quantity discounts regardless of the order quantity.
