5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
5|$|That summer Garfield {{suffered}} from jaundice and significant weight loss. He {{was forced to}} return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, {{and by the end}} of it, Garfield <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans.|$|E

In a letter dated 15 June 1194, Pope Celestine III {{laid out the}} foundational rights of the Norwegian Church supporting Eirik on every point. Empowered by this letter, Eirik could take the step of excommunicating Sverre and order the Norwegian bishops {{to join him in}} exile in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The {{huge success}} of the capture of Breda without barely a {{casualty}} was widely celebrated in the United Provinces. After years of defensive strategy combined with Spanish forces distracted with the Protestant forces in France, the Dutch and English forces <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> achieved a decisive offensive success. The strategic value of the city led to patriotic celebrations {{and a number of}} commemorative coins were minted.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning of}} June 24, the Roman troops marched eastward {{along the road}} running near the {{northern}} edge of the lake. Eager for battle, Flaminius pushed his men hard and hurried up the column in the rear. Hannibal then sent a small skirmish force to draw the vanguard away {{from the front of the}} line, in order to split the Roman forces. Once all the Romans <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> marched through the foggy, narrow defile and entered the plains skirting the lake, trumpets were blown, signalling the general attack.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March, Hopton had {{undergone}} a severe defeat at Cheriton, near New Alresford. In the preliminary manoeuvres, and in the opening stages of the battle, the advantage lay with the Royalists. The Patrick, Earl of Forth, who was present, was satisfied with what had been achieved, and tried to break off the action. But Royalist indiscipline ruined everything. A young cavalry colonel, charged in defiance of orders. A fresh engagement opened, and at the last moment, Waller snatched a victory out of defeat. Worse than this was the news from Yorkshire and Scotland. Charles <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> assented to Montrose's plan and promised him a marquessate. The first attempt to raise the Royalist standard in Scotland, however, gave no omen of its later triumphs.|$|E
25|$|King Edward III (1327–1377) succeeded {{his father}} {{at the age of}} 14. His reign was a period of {{conflict}} with Scotland and France, which is reflected in his coins. In the first part of Edwards' reign only a small quantity of pennies was produced, in a similar style to those of his father. New gold coins – the noble, half noble, and the quarter noble – were introduced, followed later by the silver groat or fourpence which became very popular and eventually superseded the penny in importance, together with the half groat which was also popular. Together with the production of half pennies and farthings, England <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> an adequate supply of varying denominations which benefited both internal trade and trade with other countries in Europe where English coins were readily acceptable.|$|E
25|$|For now, Maryland {{remained}} a slave state, but {{the tide was}} turning. In 1863 and 1864 growing numbers of Maryland slaves simply left their plantations to join the Union Army, accepting the promise of military service in return for freedom. One effect of this was to bring slave auctions to an end, as any slave could avoid sale, and win their freedom, by simply offering to join the army. In 1863 Crisfield was defeated in local elections by the abolitionist candidate John Cresswell, amid allegations of vote-rigging by the army. In Somerset County, Maryland, Cresswell outpolled Crisfield {{by a margin of}} 6,742 votes to 5,482, with Union soldiers effectively deciding the vote in favor of Cresswell. The Civil War was not yet over, but slavery in Maryland <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> run its course. The abolitionists had almost won.|$|E

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1930, Tombaugh's search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching {{for nearly a year}} and examining nearly 2million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement. Upon confirmation, Tombaugh walked into Slipher's office and declared, [...] "Doctor Slipher, I have found your PlanetX." [...] The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for PlanetX [...] Lowell had suggested; thus it seemed he <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> been vindicated. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. The new object was later precovered on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915. The decision to name the object Pluto was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell, as his initials made up the word's first two letters. After discovering Pluto, Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects. He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids, as well as two comets, but no further planets.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} the Empire to provide an {{effective}} siege train had, up to this point, robbed the Allies of victory– neither Munich nor Ulm could be taken, and the Elector had neither been defeated nor compelled to change allegiance. Prince Eugene had become increasingly worried that no decisive action had followed the victory on the Schellenberg, writing to the Duke of Savoy, [...] "...I cannot admire their performances. They have been counting on the Elector coming to terms... they have amused themselves with... burning a few villages instead of... marching straight upon the enemy." [...] Tallard arrived in Augsburg with French reinforcements on 5 August. Eugene, shadowing Tallard, was also heading south with 18,000 men, {{but he had been}} forced to leave behind 12,000 troops guarding the Lines of Stollhofen with which to prevent Villeroi bringing further French reinforcements to the Danube. Moreover, the Elector <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> sent orders to the large Bavarian contingents on the Tyrolese border to rejoin the main army. For the Allies, therefore, time was short: they must defeat the French and their allies at once, or all south Germany would be lost.|$|E
500|$|Cardigan's {{overwhelming}} {{enthusiasm for}} the army remained and the meticulous standards of dress and parade that he had required of his earlier commands he now applied to the whole cavalry. He was made Colonel of the Regiment of the 5th Dragoon Guards in 1859, but he derived more satisfaction when, after his formal retirement in 1860, and its accompanying promotion to Lieutenant-General, he became colonel of his favourite regiment, the 11th Hussars, which he had first commanded in 1836. He remained in royal favour and early in 1861 he was selected to accompany the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, to inspect Prussian cavalry manoeuvres. He was possibly an unwise choice as his arrogant behaviour towards his hosts, themselves no strangers to high self-esteem among military officers, resulted in numerous challenges to duel; he was quickly sent home. The Queen, however, blocked his colonelcy {{of one of the}} Household regiments because of his dalliance with Adeline while still married to Elizabeth. His last military function was a mounted review of the 11th Hussars before their embarkation for India in May 1866. He was joined by Colonel John Reynolds, who had been Cardigan's adversary in the [...] "black bottle affair", but the men <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> settled their differences in the previous year.|$|E

500|$|After its release, Evita {{garnered}} critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, [...] "It's {{a relief}} to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has {{more than just a}} bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." [...] Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role. She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: [...] "Now 38 years old, Madonna <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public." [...] Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997; she declared that they were [...] "better off as best friends." ...|$|E

Pope Leo XIII wrote, [...] "In the presence of so much suffering, the condition of slavery, in which a considerable part of the great human family has been sunk in squalor and affliction now for many centuries, is deeply to be deplored; for the system is one which is wholly opposed to that which was originally ordained by God and by nature" ...|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{accomplishment}} of Andriantsitakatrandriana's reign was the initial {{transformation of the}} vast Betsimitatatra swamps surrounding the hill of Analamanga into fertile rice paddies {{through the construction of}} dikes. Until his time, only zozoro (an indigenous sedge), rushes, and clusters of trees grew in the marshy lands around the capital city of Antananarivo, which his father <b>had</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> wrested from its Vazimba occupants several decades before. After clear-cutting the marshes, Andriantsitakatrandriana ordered the construction of a dike {{at the southern end of}} the swamp near Andriantany. The marshes to the west of Antananarivo were the first to be planted as rice paddies. Successive sovereigns would continue this work and progressively transform the entire Betsimitatatra into a continuous patchwork of rice paddies.|$|E
