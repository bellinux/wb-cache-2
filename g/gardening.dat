5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned <b>gardening,</b> which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in <b>gardening</b> at the time. Modern <b>gardening</b> practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult.

Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E

5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are <b>gardening,</b> so taking extra caution or avoiding <b>gardening</b> altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
