40|$|Abstract — Hybrid {{electrical}} energy storage (HEES) systems {{are composed of}} multiple banks of heterogeneous {{electrical energy}} storage (EES) elements with distinctive properties. Charge replacement in a HEES system (i. e., dynamic assignment of load demands to EES banks) {{is one of the}} key operations in the system. This paper formally describes the global charge replacement (GCR) optimization problem and provides an algorithm to find the near-optimal GCR control policy. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, where the objective function is the charge replacement efficiency. The constraints account for the energy conservation law, efficiency of the charger/converter, the rate capacity effect, and self-discharge rates plus internal resistances of the EES <b>element</b> <b>arrays.</b> The near-optimal solution to this problem is obtained while considering the state of charges (SoCs) of the EES <b>element</b> <b>arrays,</b> characteristics of the load devices, and estimates of energy contributions by the EES <b>element</b> <b>arrays.</b> Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the charge replacement efficiency in an example HEES system comprised of banks of battery and supercapacitor elements with a high-power pulsed military radio transceiver as the load device.

The estimation technique employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate unknown system parameters, utilizing a novel, multi-dimensional, Bayesian, global optimization strategy for initializing a Metropolis-Hastings proposal distribution. The technique enables the design of a high performance multi-user GPS receiver, capable of overcoming the near-far problem when the relative signal power is on the order of 5 dB (single antenna element) and 20 dB (4 antenna <b>element</b> <b>array)</b> and providing dramatically improved performance over conventional matched filter techniques against interference and jamming when the relative jammer and satellite signal power is on the order of 20 dB (4 antenna <b>element</b> <b>array)</b> ...|$|R
