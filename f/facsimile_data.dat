The CSM scheme first partitions the data into run-length regions and symbol regions. The run-length regions are then coded by a modified Interline Coding technique, while the data within the symbol region is further subpartitioned into regions defined as symbols. A prototype symbol library is maintained, and as each new symbol is encountered, it is compared with each element of the library. These comparisons produce a signature for the new symbol. A tolerance threshold is {{used to evaluate the}} "goodness" of the comparison. If the tolerance threshold indicates a matching symbol, then only the location and the library address need be transmitted. otherwise the new symbol is both transmitted and placed in the library. For finite sized libraries a scoring system determines which elements of the library are to be replaced by new prototypes. Simulation results are demonstrated for both CCITT and Xerox standard documents. In all cases the CSM compression ratio exceeds the best published run-length technique by a factor of at least two, for pages that are predominately test.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{creative}} project was to demonstrate the need for, and the subsequent development of, an anatomy/physiology course model designed in concept and implemented with representative content so as to provide unique curricular and instructional advantages to community college based allied health career students. To accomplish this purpose, three objectives were achieved. They were: 1. to ascertain the nature and form of anatomy/ physiology courses currently offered for students of allied health career programs in community colleges. 2. to develop a curriculum model for an anatomy/ physiology course proposed to more appropriately meet institutional and student needs than courses currently offered in that basic science. 3. to construct a valid evaluative instrument {{which could be used}} to assess the opinion of administrative heads of health career programs regarding the efficacy of the proposed curriculum. In order to achieve the first objective, fifty community colleges were randomly chosen for survey. These colleges represented a sample of all community colleges which hosted from four to twenty programs in nursing and allied health careers and which indicated full time student enrollments of from 2500 to 15, 000. The types of allied health career programs and the form of anatomy/physiology offered by each college was determined by a study of selected college catalogs and national. directories. It was found that, in these colleges, there does exist a wide variety of curricular forms of anatomy/physiology taken by health career programs. Multi-curriculum forms were especially prevalent and where core courses did exist, theywere described in the catalogs of the colleges as a sequence of two interdependent courses. In order to demonstrate that an anatomy/physiology course could be developed which would provide not only commonalities in content but relativeness to the student's career interest area, this creative project formulated in concept and implemented with representative content a unique instructional design for anatomy/physiology which entailed the differentiation of course concepts through core and modular curricular forms. This technique of graded topic complexity was demonstrated within the project model at the total course, course topic and modular level of instruction. This was achieved by considering total course content as typically represented in anatomy/physiology texts and college catalog course descriptions and then differentiating that content into basic and advanced levels of comprehension. In addition to this content differentiation, behavioral objectives were also differentiated into basic and advanced levels for one suggested unit of instruction. Because innovative curriculum forms, when proposed by writers, often do {{not take into account the}} impact of their implementation upon students, faculty or administration, it was also an objective of this project to provide the design of an attitudinal scale which could serve as an evaluative instrument for institutional review of the curriculum. This scale was developed along the lines of a Likert type scale. Scale items were first validated through expert opinion and final items were derived after item analysis, employing a discriminatory power technique. While neither the scale nor the model curriculum itself was distributed to any real sample of individuals for assessment of opinion regarding the curriculum structure, <b>facsimile</b> <b>data</b> was introduced and a statistical technique utilized which demonstrated the manner in which significance of difference of opinion between two hypothetical groups could be determined.

40|$|The system {{requirements}} and hardware implementation for electromagnetic compensation of antenna performance degradations due to thermal effects was investigated. Future commercial space communication antenna systems will utilize the 20 / 30 GHz frequency spectrum and support very narrow multiple beams (0. 3 deg) over wide angle {{field of view}} (15 - 20 beamwidth). On the ground, portable and inexpensive very small aperture terminals (VSAT) for transmitting and receiving video, <b>facsimile</b> and <b>data</b> will be employed. These types of communication system puts a very stringent requirement on spacecraft antenna beam pointing stability (less than. 01 deg), high gain (greater than 50 dB) and very lowside lobes (less than - 25 dB). Thermal analysis performed on the advanced communication technology satellite (ACTS) {{has shown that the}} reflector surfaces, the mechanical supporting structures and metallic surfaces on the spacecraft body will distort due thermal effects from a varying solar flux. The antenna performance characteristics (e. g., pointing stability, gain, side lobe, etc.) will degrade due to thermal distortion in the reflector surface and supporting structures. Specifically, antenna RF radiation analysis has shown that pointing error is the most sensitive antenna performance parameter to thermal distortions. Other antenna parameters like peak gain, cross polarization level (beam isolation), and side lobe level will also degrade with thermal distortions. In order to restore pointing stability and in general antenna performance several compensation methods were proposed. In general these compensation methods can be classified as being either of mechanical or electromagnetic type. This paper will address only the later one. In this approach an adaptive phased array antenna feed is used to compensate for the antenna performance degradation.

In this thesis we devise new or improved schemes for wireless communications using MIMO antenna systems. First, an exact BER expression of MIMO zero-forcing for BPSK and QPSK in flat fading channels is derived.

Both of the schemes have a performance close to optimal maximum likelihood detection (MLD) but with much less complexity than MLD. Three MLSE forms were also generalized to the situation when the channel is a time-varying MIMO channel. They show that the complexity of Ungerboeck is lowest among the three MIMO MLSE forms.

The shift roster {{plays an important role}} in moderating the influence of non standard working hours on the individual and the group though it is well documented that shift work does affect everyone differently. Aspects of shift work that appear to be disadvantageous for many individuals can be considered to be beneficial by others depending upon the work circumstances and the needs of the individual and family. This study is concerned with shift work within a section of the Australian Defence environment - the Defence Integrated Secure Communications Network (DISCON) - Royal Australian Army Corps of Signals component, an area previously untouched by academic or other research. The significance of this study is that whilst it has focussed on a unique work environment the findings are not at variance to other shift working research. The Australian Army, through units of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals, has the responsibility of managing and operating the Switching and Communications Centres throughout the states of Victoria and Queensland, and within the cities of Canberra and Sydney. Shift workers and the shift working rosters operating within these units are the focus of this study. The purpose of this study is to compare the four shift working rosters operating within the four different Army units with DISCON and determine which one is most appropriate in terms of current roster design guidelines and shift worker preference. DISCON was established to support the operations of the Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence for the rest of this century and beyond. DISCON is Defence's first secure, integrated communications system, and will be used for command and control of the Australian Defence Force as well as management and administration of the Defence Organisation. DISCON operates by means of interconnected switching centres which direct all incoming message traffic to its destination and link Defence establishments Australia-wide. DISCON Switching Centres serve a particular region through Communications Centres and decentralised communications terminals. DISCON has brought with it new technology, new equipment and a range of new services to its subscribers. DISCON provides facilities for the passage of voice (secure and insecure telephone), facsimile, telegraph and electronic data and is expected to support the current range of tactical (field) external networks and individual tactical radio communication.

Signals typically arrive at the receiver via a scattering mechanism resulting in multiple propagation paths with different time delays, amplitude, and phases. Therefore, a time delay spread also occurs and this imposes a limit on the maximum transmission rate. This multipath propagation also produces inter-symbol interference (ISI) which leads to the introduction of an irreducible error floor. Recently, a new modulation technique, known as multicode modulation, has been developed for high-speed data transmission over wireless environments. In this method, the incoming high-rate data stream is divided into a number of parallel low-rate bit streams as in multitone modulation. However, each low-rate data stream is then modulated by a code, which is a combination of orthogonal codes and spreading sequences, on a single carrier. The processing gain is properly selected so that the required bandwidth will be the same as that of the original high-rate data stream; thereby, gaining the inherent benefit of multipath rejection without expanding the bandwidth of the original high-rate stream. Potential applications of this method include those that require variable and high transmission rates such as wireless Ethernet connection for multimedia communications. In this thesis, we investigate the use of channel coding, such as convolutional codes and turbo codes, in multicode modulation over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. In addition, we propose various multicode modulation schemes which employ different combination of orthogonal codes and signature sequences. In order to improve the system performance, we also consider the use of antenna diversity. Since the conventional multicode system uses a RAKE receiver in each sub-channel, the complexity of the receiver can be quite high. Hence, we propose a new low-complexity receiver structure for the multicode modulation system which is based on the concept of Fast Walsh Transform or Fast Fourier Transform. There may be one possible disadvantage of multicode modulation; namely, the peak-to-average power ratio can become large when the number of sub-channels is large. Hence, power amplifiers which are linear in a wide range are required for the amplification of these signals. Thereby, reducing the efficiency of the power amplifier. We thus propose a new orthogonal code structure that can reduce the peak-to-average power ratio...|$|R
