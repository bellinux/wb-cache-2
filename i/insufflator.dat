In 1957, Fikentscher, Semm and three other physicians founded of the Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Studium der Fertilität und Sterilität, renamed Deutsche Gesellschaft für Reproduktionsmedizin in 1998. In the 1960s Semm started to use laparoscopy - he named it ‘’pelviscopy’’ - for gynecologic indications, initially as a diagnostic tool, but soon realizing that the laparoscopic approach had potential for interventive surgery. His experience as toolmaker let him to found the WISAP medical instrument company in 1959 allowing him to developed numerous instruments among them an automated electronic CO2 <b>insufflator,</b> uterine manipulators, thermocoagulators to stop bleeding, and extra- and intracorporeal endocopic knotting devices to tie off vessels or remove organs.|$|E
5000|$|Politzer was a {{prolific}} inventor of new medical devices for {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of ear diseases. He developed several surgical instruments which bear his name for the operation of the outer and the inner ear structures, such as an ear perforator, a surgical knife, a grommet for the ventilation of the inner ear after paracentesis, as well as a method to restore permeability to the Eustachian tube by using an <b>insufflator</b> made out of a pear-shaped rubber bag ("politzerisation" [...] or Politzer's method). He also devised methods and apparatuses to examine the outer ear canal and tympanic membrane (Politzer's otoscope), a speculum and a qualitative test for the function of the Eustachian tube. In the field of hearing, Politzer devised an acoumeter for measuring hearing acuity and at least two early acoustical hearing aids.|$|E

Frangenheim later recalled” I {{realized that this}} could mean a new aid for gynecology and began looking into the literature.”Frangenheim improved instrumentation and started to perform laparoscopic procedure {{on a regular basis}} by 1952. In 1955 Frangenheim visited Raoul Palmer in Paris another pioneer in laparoscopy applying it for the investigation of infertility. In 1958 Frangenheim reported his experience when few gynecologist were using the abdominal approach to investigate the pelvis. More popular was at that time the approach pioneered by Albert Decker using culdoscopy. Frangenheim developed an improved <b>insufflator</b> to facilitate the installation of CO2 into the abdomen. [...] He started to teach numerous interested colleagues at the Wuppertal hospital, among them Patrick Steptoe. Frangenheim published the first book about gynecologic laparoscopy in 1959. He pointed out that it was superior to culdoscopy and useful for investigations of infertility and ectopic pregnancy.In 1964 Frangenheim presented the use of “cold light” whereby the light was transmitted through fiberoptics to the laparoscope. Illumination was much better and Frangenheim predicted that this would replace traditional illumination that had the light bulb incorporated {{at the tip of the}} instrument. Frangenheim not only used laparoscopy for diagnostic indications but also started to do operative interventions. Along with Palmer Frangenheim introduced a laparoscopic method to block the fallopian tubes for sterilization.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{procedures}} utilize a pneumoperitoneum to distend {{and separate}} the abdominal wall from the intra-abdominal structures. Carbon dioxide {{is commonly used}} for this purpose, although this study is inclusive of any gas used for abdominal distention. The gas is delivered from cylinders through a gas insufflation delivery system. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if laparoscopic gas delivery systems composed of gas cylinders and <b>insufflators</b> used for laparoscopy have microbes present. Methods: Gas delivery systems were evaluated for the presence of microbial growth using standard techniques. External connection sites, gas cylinders and the internal conduit tubing of <b>insufflators</b> were cultured. Fifty two (52) <b>insufflators</b> and sixty (60) gas cylinders were evaluated. Results: Twelve (12) of the sixty cylinders (20 %) and fifty four (54) of the sixty <b>insufflators</b> (92. 3 %) were culture positive. The organisms identified are significant and a varied spectrum. Conclusions: Recognition that gas cylinders, insufflation attachments and internal components of <b>insufflators</b> quantitatively contain microbes is demonstrated. Reduction of microbial exposure from insufflation apparatus is achieved by cleansing external ports and use of a 0. 3 micron filter for abdominal pneumoperitoneum...|$|R

40|$|Background: Increased intra-abdominal {{pressure}} (IAP) leads to {{adverse effects on}} most organ systems and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in surgical and trauma patients. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on IAP and abdominal perfusion pressure (APP, mean arterial pressure, MAP minus IAP) at normal and increased {{intra-abdominal pressure}}s. Methods: 15 patients requiring a laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included.

Two hundred and forty-four strains out of 446 samples collected at several sites were isolated and bio-chemically characterized as coagulase-positive staphylococcus. Specific chromosome DNA fragment of the species Staphylococcus aureus was amplified to 106 strains and 103 underwent (PFGE).

40|$|Dry powder {{formulations}} for inhalation have to {{be screened}} in animal studies for therapeutic efficacy and safety aspects and both are significantly affected by the dose and the particle size distribution (PSD) of the aerosol that is given. One {{of the most frequently}} used apparatus for pulmonary delivery of dry powder formulations in mice studies is the PennCentury (TM) DP- 4 M Dry Powder <b>Insufflator.</b> To make researchers of future preclinical animal studies with the DP- 4 M <b>insufflator</b> aware of the pitfalls regarding the conclusions to be drawn from their data, we investigated the dispersion behaviour by the DP- 4 M <b>insufflator</b> using two to three different powder preparation techniques for four different compounds. The primary PSDs of the different formulations were determined in duplicate by laser diffraction analysis. To measure the PSDs of the aerosols obtained with the DP- 4 M <b>insufflator,</b> the same diffractometer was used in combination with an in-house constructed adapter for the <b>insufflator.</b> The dispersion efficiency and delivered dose were highly affected by the amount of air available for dispersion; the 200 mu L of air recommended for the type of <b>insufflator</b> used was insufficient for adequate dispersion. In contrast, the weighed dose did not {{have a profound effect on}} the dispersion behaviour and the delivered dose of the DP- 4 M <b>insufflator.</b> Also the physico-chemical powder properties and the applied particle preparation technique influenced the amount and PSD of the delivered aerosol only to a limited extend, with a few exceptions. We advise researchers to investigate the dispersion efficiency and delivered dose from the DP- 4 M <b>insufflator</b> with the formulation under investigation prior to in vivo studies and it may be necessary to optimise the formulation for administration to mice.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Within recent years, the {{insufflation}} {{technique for}} laparoscopy {{has become more}} important with high flow insufflators (� 30 L/min) and high gas turn over (� 800 L/procedure). Increased amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas used can lead to laparoscopic hypothermia. We studied the <b>insufflator</b> with versus insufflators without internal gas heating (inside <b>insufflator)</b> as a sufficient method of hypothermia prevention at different flow rates. Methods: With a computer-based data acquisition model, different standard insufflators with internal gas heating (Snowden Pencer) vs. without (Storz Endoflator, Storz Laparoflator, Richard Wolf, and BEI Medical) were compared regarding CO 2 gas temperature {{at different points in}} the insufflation system (<b>insufflator</b> exit, insufflation hose end). Results: Gas temperature of the Snowden Pencer <b>insufflator,</b> which is flow-rate dependent, increases at the exit (max. 35. 4 °C). However, gas temperature is back to room temperature (- 0. 22 to � 1. 10 °C) {{at the end of the}} insufflation hose (10 ft or 3 m) for all 5 insufflators studied.

40|$|Objective During {{laparoscopic surgery}} distractions often occur and {{multitasking}} between surgery and other tasks, such as technical equipment handling, {{is a necessary}} competence. In psychological research, reduction of adverse effects of distraction is demonstrated when specifically multitasking is trained. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether multitasking and more specifically task-switching can be trained in a virtual-reality (VR) laparoscopic skills simulator. Design After randomization, the control group trained separately with an <b>insufflator</b> simulation module and a laparoscopic skills exercise module on a VR simulator. In the intervention group, <b>insufflator</b> module and VR skills exercises were combined to develop a new integrated training in which multitasking was a required competence. At random moments, problems with the <b>insufflator</b> appeared and forced the trainee to multitask. During several repetitions of a different multitask VR skills exercise as posttest, performance parameters (laparoscopy time, <b>insufflator</b> time, and errors) were measured and compared between both the groups as well with a pretest exercise to establish the learning effect. A face-validity questionnaire was filled afterward. Setting University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. Participants Medical and PhD students (n = 42) from University Medical Centre Utrecht, without previous experience in laparoscopic simulation, were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 21) or control group (n = 21). Results All participants performed better in the posttest exercises without distraction of the <b>insufflator</b> compared with the exercises in which multitasking was necessary to solve the <b>insufflator</b> problems. After training, the intervention group was significantly quicker in solving the <b>insufflator</b> problems (mean = 1. 60 Log(s) vs 1. 70 Log(s), p = 0. 02). No significant differences between both the groups were seen in laparoscopy time and errors. Conclusion Multitasking has negative effects on the laparoscopic performance. This study suggests an additional learning effect of training multitasking in VR laparoscopy simulation, because the trainees are able to handle a secondary task (solving <b>insufflator</b> problems) quicker. These results may aid the development of laparoscopy VR training programs in approximating real-life laparoscopic surgery...|$|E

30|$|While it {{is widely}} {{considered}} that laparoscopy may be less adhesiogenic than laparotomy, there are some inconsistencies when epidemiological data on adhesion-related outcomes are considered [3]. Since laparoscopy is minimally invasive and, thus, associated with less surgical trauma than laparotomy, there is rising concern that the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum {{may be an important}} adhesiogenic factor. This {{may be due to the}} CO 2 inducing local changes such as intraperitoneal acidosis [66 – 68] or, in the absence of moistening, dessication of the mesothelium [69]. The intraperitoneal pressure associated with prolonged pneumoperitoneum may also induce adverse effects on the microcirculation [70, 71], possibly inducing hypoxaemia [72]. This hypoxia, together with other mesothelial insult, may stimulate the expression of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in an increase in adhesion formation [72]. As a result of this animal work, active research for other potential adhesion-reduction strategies involving <b>insufflators</b> has begun [73, 74].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{segmentation}} {{framework for}} a prepless virtual colonoscopy (VC) is presented, which reduces {{the necessity for}} colon cleansing before the CT scan. The patient is injected rectally with a water-soluble iodinated contrast medium using manual <b>insufflators</b> and a small rectal catheter. Compared to the air-based contrast medium, this technique can better preserve the color lumen and reduce the partial volume effect. However, the contrast medium, together with the fecal materials and air, makes colon wall segmentation challenging. Our solution makes no assumptions about the shape, size, and location of the fecal material in the colon. This generality allows us to label the fecal material accurately and extract the colon wall reliably. The accuracy of our technique has been verified on 60 human subjects.

40|$|Purpose. To prepare powder {{formulations}} for brain {{targeting of}} an antiischemic agent by nasal administration. Methods. The microparticles {{have been obtained}} by spray-drying {{in the presence of}} mannitol and lecithin, or chitosan as carriers. The drug content was detected by UV-spectrophotometric analysis; morphology by scanning electronic spectroscopy and particle size by laser diffraction. In vitro drug release studies from microspheres were achieved according to USP 24. Ex vivo mucoadhesive tests were performed on sheep nasal mucosa blowing an air stream over the microsppheres spread onto the mucosa and calculating the detection of drug content by HPLC, upon dissolution in water. The permeability of both free and microencapsulated drug was studied onto sheep nasal mucosa using phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) as receptor solution and measuring drug concentrations by HPLC. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of drug. Its nasal administration was also performed using <b>insufflators</b> Monopowder P® (Valois Dispray, France). After the administrations, blood and liquor samples, the olfactory bulb and ventricular sections of the brain were withdrawn and the related drug amounts analysed by HPLC. Results. The drug influenced the size and morphology of microparticles. The dissolution rate of drug decreased after loading in chitosan microparticles. About 60 % of these microspheres was recovered after mucoadhesive tests. The permeation rate of free drug was higher than the encapsulated drug in chitosan microspheres. The drug was not found in the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous administration, which allowed to obtain blood concentrations in the micromolar range.

The powders have been obtained by spray-drying in the presence either of mannitol and lecithin, or chitosan as carriers. The drug content was detected by UV-spectrophotometric analysis, morphology by scanning electronic spectroscopy and particle size by laser diffraction. In vitro drug release studies from microspheres were carried out according to USP 24. Ex vivo mucoadhesive tests were performed on sheep nasal mucosa blowing an air stream over the microspheres spread onto the mucosa and calculating the detection of drug content by HPLC, upon dissolution in water of microparticles still adhered onto the mucosa. The permeability of both free and microencapsulated drug was studied across sheep nasal mucosa using phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) as receptor solution. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of drug. Nasal administration was also performed using <b>insufflators</b> Monopowder P® (Valois Dispray, France). After the administration, blood and liquor samples, as well as the olfactory bulb and ventricular sections of the brain were withdrawn and the respective drug amounts analysed by HPLC. According to our results, the drug influenced the particle size and morphology in comparison with blank microparticles. The drug dissolution rate increased or decreased after loading in mannitol or chitosan microparticles, respectively. About 60 % of chitosan microspheres was recovered from mucoadhesive tests. The permeation rate of free drug was lower or higher than that of the encapsulated drug in mannitol or chitosan microspheres, respectively. The drug was not found in the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous administration, which led to blood concentrations in the micromolar range. However, after nasal administration of the same dose, the drug was found in the CNS (up to micromolar range in the liquor, up to 0. 2 ng/mg tissue in the brain sections). The CPA amounts detected in rat blood after nasal administration of the powders appeared negligible with respect to the amounts detected after intravenous administration.

40|$|The lung is {{more and}} more of {{interest}} for local as well as for systemic administration of drugs. Nevertheless, the development of modern inhalable medicines is moving forward only slowly. Especially the lack of safety and efficacy data combined with unsatisfactory in vitro models for the investigation of the complex processes on the air-blood barrier decelerates the development of new aerosol medicines. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the transport of peptides with different molecular weight across submersed human alveolar epithelial cells has been investigated. The measured absorption/ secretion rates allow quantifying of permeability and the identification of active or passive transports, but the influence of formulation parameters like size or charge disappears after preparing solutions and adding these in the fluid filled apical compartment of submersed cell culture. However, with the aid of a relatively simple <b>insufflator</b> syringe and air interface cultivated cells, a deposition more close to the in vivo situation was possible. It was found that air interface deposition yielded higher absorption rates and that differences in particle size significantly influenced the absorption rates only after air interface deposition but not after liquid interface deposition. Even if the application with the <b>insufflator</b> syringe offers the opportunity to deposit dry particles on the air interface of cell monolayers the method wasn 2 ̆ 7;t able to simulate in vivo relevant impaction processes. Especially in case of dry powder aerosols composed of large carrier lactose particles and adherent micronized drug crystals, impaction processes during aerosolisation normally accomplish separation of the drug from the carrier. Only the sufficiently small (< 5 µm) drug crystals are deposited in the deeper regions of the lung. As the <b>insufflator</b> fails to separate the drug crystals from the carrier lactose, and as the particle size of the carrier particles significantly influences the dissolution and absorption behaviour, a cell compatible aerosol impingement system was designed. A commercial available MSLI was modified to incorporate cell culture inserts in the relevant stages. Complex powder formulations could be size fractionated and the size fractions which are able to reach in vivo the deep lung were deposited on cell monolayers. Significantly changed absorption behaviour could be detected in dependency of cell culture fluid volume, particle size and deposition mode. Im ersten Teil der Dissertation wurde die Permeation von gelösten Peptiden mit verschiedenem Molekulargewicht durch Monolayer humaner alveolarer Epithelzellen untersucht. Auch wenn das Arbeiten mit Lösungen für die Untersuchung intestinaler Absorptionsvorgänge die in vivo Situation ausreichend genau wiedergibt, stellt diese Methode keine realistische Applikationsart für Aerosole dar, da die menschliche Luft-Blut-Schranke beim gesunden Patienten nur mit einem ausgesprochen dünnen Flüssigkeitsfilm bedeckt ist, der nur den hundertsten Teil der Dicke üblicher Flüssigkeitsschichten in submersen Zellkulturen ausmacht. Realitätsnah lassen sich jedoch Calu- 3 Zellen als Modelle des Bronchialepithels, und primäre humane alveolare Epithelzellen als Modell der alveolaren Bereiche der Lunge, ohne flüssigkeitsgefülltes apikales Kompartiment kultivieren. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wurde mittels solcher an der Luft-Grenzschicht kultivierter zellulärer Modelle untersucht inwiefern die Applikation als Lösung oder in Form eines trockenen Pulveraerosols den Transport von Arzneistoffen beeinflusst. Nach Deposition trockener Aerosolformulierungen auf Luft-Grenzschicht kultivierte Zellen konnten signifikant schnellere Resorptionsvorgänge gemessen werden. Obwohl die angewandte Applikation mittels einer <b>Insufflator</b> Spritze an sich schon eine sinnvolle Verbesserung von Transportexperimenten an Modellen der Luft-Blutschranke darstellt, berücksichtigt die <b>Insufflator</b> Spritze nicht alle Aerosol Charakteristika.

40|$|In the United States, culdoscopy (a vaginal {{approach}} {{to view the}} abdomen) replaced laparoscopy for about 20 years, circa 1950 - 1970. In contrast to many of his colleagues, Hans Frangenheim of Wuppertal, Germany, was not satisfied with culdoscopy and turned to an abdominal approach. Frangenheim began publishing his experiences with gynecological laparoscopy in 1958 and stressed technical improvements. He constructed a CO 2 <b>insufflator,</b> wrote the first book on gynecological endoscopy, and introduced "cold light" into laparoscopy. Frangenheim strongly stimulated the rise of gynecological laparoscopy in Europe in the 1960 s and later...|$|E
30|$|The excess pCO 2 in the CO 2 {{group was}} most likely caused by the {{absorption}} of CO 2 inserted into the abdominal cavity with the laparoscopic <b>insufflator.</b> This effect is already known [14]. All changes in acid-base status occurred despite our attempts to ensure sufficient ventilation, {{as described in the}} 'Materials and methods' section. Base excess was lowered almost equally in both our experimental groups. This could mean that the maximum capacity of metabolic compensation for acidosis was reached in the CO 2 group. In addition, the anuria precluded metabolic compensatory mechanisms that require functioning kidneys.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of totally extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, many surgeons will inevitably face the clinical conundrum of how to simultaneously repair an umbilical hernia and an inguinal hernia via TEP approach. Case Presentation: In this case report, we describe the successful use of the umbilical hernia defect to insert the balloon dissector and gas <b>insufflator</b> in the pre-peritoneal plane without making an additional fascial incision. Conclusions: We suggest that this best preserves the integrity of the umbilical hernia repair by avoiding an additional area of weakness in the rectus sheath. 3 page(s...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{verify the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} compressed air to produce pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery in pigs for a training program of residence. METHODS: Dalland pigs weighing 15 - 17 kg underwent general anethesia and mechanical ventilation. They were divided in 3 groups: A - (38) the pneumoperitnoneum was established with an automatic CO 2 <b>insufflator,</b> B - (7) as in A except the CO 2 gas was changed by compressed air, and C - (11) abdomen insufflation was obtained with compressed air directly from hospital pipe network system. Intra-abdominal pressure in all groups was kept between 12 and 15 mmHg. The laparoscopic procedures performed were distributed proportionally among groups: 20 bilateral nephrectomy, 20 dismembered pyeloplasty and 16 partial nephrectomy. Arterial blood sampling for gasometry was obtained before and 2 h after establishment of pneumoperitoneum in 5 pigs of group C. RESULTS: The cost of 25 4, 5 kg CO 2 container used in group A was R$ 3, 150. 00 (U$ 1, 050. 00). The mean length time of surgeries in groups A, B and C were respectively: 181 ± 30 min, 196 ± 39 min e 210 ± 47 min (p> 0. 05). Respiratory alkalosis occurred in 3 out of 5 pigs of group C. No animal exhibited signs of gas embolism or died during surgery. CONCLUSION: The use of compressed air for laparoscopy in pigs was safe, reduced costs and did not {{require the use of}} an automatic gas <b>insufflator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of the Penn-Century Dry Powder <b>Insufflator</b> for mice (DP- 4 M®) to reproducibly, uniformly, and deeply deliver dry powders for inhalation in the mouse lung. Itraconazole-based dry powder formulations produced by spray-drying were different in terms of composition (different ratios of drug and mannitol, with or without phospholipids), but relatively similar in terms of particle size and mass median aerodynamic diameter. The ability of the dry powder <b>insufflator</b> to disaggregate each formulation was the same, indicated by the absence of a statistically significant difference between the particle size distribution parameters, as measured by laser scattering. The emitted fraction varied in vivo compared to the in vitro condition. Fluorescent particle distribution in the lungs was uniform and reached the alveolar spaces, as visualized by fluorescent microscopy. In terms of drug recovery in lung tissue, a minimum administered powder mass (in this case ∼ 1 mg) was necessary to recover at least 30 % of the emitted dose in the lung and to obtain reproducible pulmonary concentrations. To reduce the dose administered in the lung, it was preferable to dilute the active ingredient within the carrier instead of reducing the dry powder mass inserted in the sampling chamber. Dry powder insufflators are devices usable in dose-dependent preclinical trials but have critical parameters to efficiently deliver reproducible doses depending on the type of formulation.
