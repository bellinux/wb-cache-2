40|$|The Gram {{negative}} obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis has a dichotomous {{existence as}} a commensal bacterium and an opportunistic pathogen. B. fragilis {{is a normal}} resident of the G. I. tract and is thought to aid immune system development. Analysis of the whole genome sequences of B. fragilis NCTC 9343 and 638 R led {{to the discovery of}} the ubb gene, the gene product BfUbb, was detected in outer membrane vesicle (OMV) associated culture supernatant of both NCTC 9343 and 638 R. BfUbb shares 63 % homology with human ubiquitin. Reactivity against human ubiquitin was noted in serum raised against recombinant BfUbb whilst human serum samples from patients with autoimmune disease demonstrated a range of reactivity against rBfUbb, the native BfUbb protein and eukaryotic ubiquitin. Four Taqman qPCR assays with specific gene targets were used to analyse a range of clinical samples. Two of the gene targets were; the bjt gene, the product of which is the B. <b>fragils</b> enterotoxin and the ubb gene. Analysis of a limited number of fresh colonic biopsies found an association between the presence of the ubb and bft genes in adherent B. fjragilis populations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients when compared with healthy controls. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of separate colonic biopsy sections suggested the presence of OMV producing adherent B. fragilis populations in samples from patients with IBD. OMVs have been shown to deliver immunomodulatory NCTC 9343 polysaccharide A to dendritic cells, implying a commensal function. The current study highlights an association between OMVs and putative virulence factors involved in fibrinogen binding and degradation suggesting dual commensal and pathogenic functions. OMVs are also. thought {{to play a role in}} BfUbb secretion. The presence of significant amounts of this bacterial homologue of human ubiquitin could interfere with host ubiquitination and may have profound implications in relation to IBD and autoimmune disease.

40|$|Dugesia is a genus of {{free-living}} flatworms which species inhabit freshwater bodies {{across a}} wide distribution range that includes Africa, Madagascar, Eurasia and Australasia. They do not survive in salt water or under desiccation conditions. All Dugesia species have a characteristic triangular-shaped head with two eyes and an elongated and dorsoventrally flattened body. This general shape makes them recognizable to non-experts that also know them because of their regeneration capabilities. The two first works of this thesis {{are focused on the}} Dugesia historical biogeography. In first place we studied its species on Greece, because of its complex and well-known geological history and the high diversity of species known on the area. The results showed interesting evidences of the diversification of the genus on the area driven by its history of geological breakage since the Neogene, by the contact and severing of ancient freshwater bodies, and probably by changes in the sea level of the Mediterranean. We also observed patterns of dispersion in the Greek mainland and the Peloponnese. In a second work we included the whole Dugesia distribution range. The aim was to test the previous hypotheses on the antiquity and dispersal routes of the genus to its present geographical distribution. The last hypothesis proposed an African origin in a Gondwanan scenario during the Mesozoic period followed by a dispersion in Eurasia through the impact of the Indian subcontinent or through the impact of the Arabian plate. Our results suggest an older origin, being the genus already present on Pangaea before its breakage. Taking into account this old origin and the internal and external homogeneity of the Dugesia genus species, this is probably a case of long-term or extreme morphological stasis. The copulatory apparatus is essential for Dugesia species description and identification. However, fissiparous specimens do not have this organ, making impossible to know which species are we dealing with. In other cases the inner morphology is very similar or identical among different species, hindering the species identification. In these cases the use of molecular species delimitation methods are of major interest {{in order to try to}} overcome these morphology associated drawbacks. In a third work we used one of these methods called General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) together with morphological data in an integrative taxonomy framework in order to describe new species from Greece and to give more support to those already described. We formally described four new Dugesia species and the new genus Recurva containing two species and a putative third one. For those clades delimited by the GMYC method for which we did not have any or incomplete morphological data we proposed two different categories: Unconfirmed or Confirmed Candidate Species. The use of molecular species delimitation methods seems to be very convenient when dealing with freshwater flatworms. At the beginning of this thesis we aimed to obtain more molecular markers by the obtention of complete mitogenomes from different triclad species. Unfortunately, this work was delayed and finally we did not succeed in the obtention of a Dugesia mitogenome but of Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) and Obama sp. (Geoplanidae). We took advantatge of these new free-living flatworm mitogenomes and we carried out an evolutionary analysis comparing them with those of parasitic flatworms in order to test if, as previously thought, the different lifecycles have had a selective effect on the nucleotide composition of the mitogenomes. Surprisingly, our results showed a more relaxed selection in the Geoplanoidea species (Dugesia, Obama and Schmidtea) in comparison with the parasitic platihelminths and Crenobia. Dugesia és un gènere de planàries de vida lliure que habita en les l'aigües dolces d'Àfrica, Madagascar, Eurasia i Australàsia. Són organismes <b>fràgils</b> que no poden sobreviure en aigua salada ni en condicions de dessecació. Les Dugesia tenen un cap triangular amb dos ulls molt característic i un cos allargat i aplanat dorsoventralment. Són conegudes popularment per les seves capacitats de regeneració. Els dos primers treballs d'aquesta tesi s'ha centrat en la biogeografia històrica de les Dugesia. Primerament vam fer un estudi de les espècies que habiten a Grècia, degut a la seva història geològica complexa i ben coneguda. Els resultats mostraren evidències de la diversificació del gènere com a conseqüència de la fragmentació d'aquesta regió, del contacte i aïllament històric dels diferents cossos d'aigua dolça i dels canvis eustàtics. El segon treball de biogeografia històrica inclou tota la distribució de Dugesia, amb el propòsit de testar les hipòtesis prèvies que han volgut explicar l'antiguitat i rutes de dispersió del gènere fins a ocupar la distribució actual. Els nostres resultats descarten un origen sobre Gondwana, com s'havia proposat anteriorment, seguit per una dispersió a Eurasia a través de l'Índia o per la península Aràbiga. Dugesia s'hauria originat al supercontinent Pangea abans del seu trencament. En un tercer treball hem emprat el mètode molecular de delimitació d'espècies General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) sobre Dugesia gregues. Vam combinar-ne els resultats amb els d'anàlisis morfològiques per identificar i descriure diverses espècies. Aquells clades delimitats pel GMYC pels quals no disposavem de dades morfològiques o bé eren incompletes van ser proposats com a espècies candidates confirmades o per confirmar. Vam descriure formalment quatre espècies de Dugesia i el nou gènere Recurva. En un treball diferent vam obtenir els mitogenomes de Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) i Obama sp. (Geoplanidae). Malgrat no aconseguir un mitogenoma de Dugesia vam aprofitar la disponibilitat de les noves molècules per realitzar una anàlisi evolutiva comparant-les amb les de platihelmints paràsits per comprovar si, tal i com s'havia proposat, els diferents tipus de vida tenen un efecte selectiu sobre la composició dels nuclèotids. Sorprenentment els nostres resultats mostren una selecció més relaxada en planàries de vida lliure...|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea, {{the largest}} and deepest {{enclosed}} sea on Earth, is a marine biodiversity hotspot. Its cetacean diversity is also remarkable; although the species with a regular occurrence and resident populations are eleven, a total of twenty-one species of cetaceans occur or have occurred in various degrees. Among the planet’s marine environments, the Mediterranean Sea {{is one of the}} most affected by anthropogenic activities. In such a complex scenario of multiple pressures acting simultaneously certain habitats and species face high risk. As very mobile, long-lived vertebrates, situated at the highest levels in the marine trophic webs and with a very low reproductive rate, cetaceans are among them. Human density and intensity of activities are particularly significant in the coastal zone. Pressure is thus most intense on coastal species, such as the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus and the short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus Delphis. This thesis focuses in these two species, aims to identify the main threats affecting them and discusses the most adequate conservation measures in order to secure their survival in the increasingly fragile waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The study areas used as case-studies in the present work are the Balearic Islands (Spain) and the coastal waters of the Eastern Ionian Sea (including the Gulf of Ambracia and the Inner Ionian Sea Archipelago, in north-western Greece). These areas are remarkably diverse in terms of environmental features and threats caused by human activities, therefore offering opportunities for understanding their links with dolphin status and conservation needs. The studies included in the present PhD thesis involved different research methods. Line-transect based aerial surveys were exclusively conducted in the Balearic Islands, while in all three study areas extensive effort was dedicated to boat-based surveys and photo-identification. A significant part of the research focused on the study of dolphin-fisheries interactions; the methods used in this part of the study differed between areas and included observers on-board of small-scale fishing boats and bottom-trawlers, direct data collection in fishing ports and landing sites on the activity of the fishing fleet and their captures, ecosystem modelling, and fishermen interviews. As this thesis shows, anthropogenic threats faced by coastal dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea are very diverse and differ quite significantly between areas. Therefore, the strategies and management measures required to trigger some effective conservation results should be tailored on a case-by-case basis. For the conservation of bottlenose dolphin population in the Balearic Islands, high priority should be given to produce ecosystem-based management strategies, including: (a) promotion of sustainable fisheries to ensure stable food resources to dolphins; (b) mitigation of adverse dolphin – fishery interactions, particularly eradication of dolphin kills; (c) prevention of marine pollution; and (d) regulation of tourism, with special attention to boat traffic in areas where bottlenose dolphins aggregate and show a higher site-fidelity and where, ideally, marine protected areas could be implemented. The situation on western Greece is quite different between the two study areas. In the Inner Ionian Sea Archipelago, where short-beaked common dolphins have suffered a dramatic decline in recent times, fishery management measures are urgently needed to reduce current over-exploitation and allow for the recovery of endangered marine megafauna. Contrarily, in the neighbouring waters of the semi-enclosed Gulf of Ambracia, which host one of the highest densities of bottlenose dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea, priority should be paid to improve the rapidly deteriorating water and seafloor quality, while ensuring continued ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Meaningful action includes restoring natural hydrology (e. g. freshwater input from rivers), curtailing pollution from various sources, responsible fisheries and aquaculture management, and control of illegal fishing. El Mar Mediterrani es veu altament afectat per activitats antropogèniques. La seva alta densitat de població i la intensitat de les activitats que en resulten són particularment importants a les zones litorals. Espècies de cetacis costaners, com el dofí mular Tursiops truncatus i el dofí comú Delphinus delphis en sufreixen les consecuències. Aquesta tesi té com a finalitat la identificació de les principals amenaces que afecten a aquestes dos espècies i proposa una sèrie de mesures de conservació per tal d'assegurar la seva supervivència en les aigües, cada vegada més <b>fràgils,</b> de la Mediterrània. Les àrees d'estudi utilitzades com a casos pràctics són les Illes Balears i les aigües costaneres del Mar Jònic oriental (incloent-hi el Golf d'Ambracia i l'arxipèlag interior del mar Jònic, al nord-oest de Grècia). Les amenaces antropogèniques a les que s’enfronten els dofins costaners a la Mediterrània són molt diverses i varien de forma significativa entre àrees. En conseqüència, les estratègies i les mesures de gestió necessàries per la seva conservació també ho fan. Per tal de protegir la població dofí mular a les Illes Balears, caldrà donar prioritat a la realització d'estratègies de gestió que tinguin en compte les necessitats dels ecosistemes: (a) promoció de la pesca sostenible; (b) la mitigació d’efectes adversos resultants d’interaccions entre dofins i pesca; (c) la prevenció de la contaminació marina; i (d) la regulació del turisme, amb especial atenció al trànsit d'embarcacions a les zones on els dofins és concentren més sovint i on, idealment, s’hi podrien crear àrees marines protegides. Pel que fa a la Grècia occidental, a l'arxipèlag Interior del Mar Jònic, on la població de dofins comuns ha patit una disminució dramàtica en els últims temps, mesures adequades per la gestió de les activitats pesqueres són necessàries per reduir l'actual sobreexplotació i permetre la recuperació de megafauna marina. D’altra banda, en el Golf d'Ambracia, on trobem una de les majors densitats de dofins mulars del mar Mediterrani, la millora de la qualitat de les seves aigües i el seu fons marí és la principal prioritat per protegir la seva important biodiversitat...|$|R
