The amount by which the actual speed exceeds the balance speed is conveniently expressed via the so-called cant deficiency, i.e., by the amount by which the superelevation {{would need to be}} increased to raise the balance speed to the speed at which the vehicles actually travel. Letting gaugese denote the rail gauge from low rail <b>gauge</b> side <b>corner</b> to high rail field side corner, letting super_el denote the actual superelevation, and letting Vact denote the actual speed, it follows from the definition that the cant deficiency, CD, is given by the formula ...|$|R
40|$|A {{great number}} of {{structures}} are subjected to thermomechanical cyclic loading. For instance, {{it is the case}} of automotive engine: components such as cylinder heads or exhaust manifolds experience cyclic thermal loading. It is also the case of rails: in curve, <b>gauge</b> <b>corners</b> are subjected to high rolling contact stresses inducing cyclic plasticity or even ratchetting. The estimation of the lifetime of such structures under cyclic thermomechanical loading requires, on the one hand, the determination of the response until an asymptotic state is reached, and on the other hand, the use of an appropriate damage criterion. The computation of the whole loading history leads to lenghty and expensive incremental calculations, especially for structures with large number of degrees of freedom. Therefore, it is very useful to develop computational approaches for straightforward calculations of the possible stabilized state under repeated thermomechanical loading. Direct Cyclic Methods offer this alternative. The paper is devoted to Direct Cyclic Methods we propose. These numerical strategies, derived from the Large Time Increment Method are alternative to classical incremental methods or cycle jump techniques. Direct Cyclic Methods permit the direct determination of the asymptotic response of inelastic structures subjected to cyclic thermomechanical loadings. The different versions of the Direct Cyclic Method are presented. They differ from the solution of the global stage which is consuming the most CPU time. The first version of the Direct Cyclic Method uses a classical finite element method to compute the SA and KA response and has been used to studying cyclic response of structures subjected to small oscillatory contact displacements for fretting fatigue applications. The second version uses Fourier expansion in solving the global equations. It is this version which is in Abaqus Sofware. The third version adopts a decomposition in a wavelet basis and the SKA solutions are estimated using only the largest coefficients...|$|R

50|$|Disadvantages include: When trains derail and {{the wheels}} hit the {{sleepers}}, timber sleepers tend {{to absorb the}} blow and remain intact, while concrete sleepers tend to shatter {{and have to be}} replaced. Initial costs are greater, and they are unsuitable for change of gauge, unless this is already taken into account. Concrete sleepers are up to 300 lbs heavier than their wooden counterparts. As a result, larger sized ballast is required to both support and hold in place the sleepers on the roadbed. Additionally, they do not absorb as much vibration from passing trains as wooden sleepers do. This can cause degradation of the sleepers themselves ranging from small cracks to complete failure over time. This problem is most prevalent when the sleepers are located next to joints in the rails. For this reason, most railroads do not use concrete sleepers on turnouts and interlockings.Another potential fault is lateral rigidity which may cause cumulative metal fatigue, particularly on reverse curves where the stresses are accentuated by the abrupt change of lateral forces. This in turn may be the cause of <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> cracking in the rails themselves as well as the steel sleeper reinforcement.German rails have experienced cracking of their sleepers on high speed lines. Damaged concrete sleepers cannot be repaired. Old concrete sleepers can be used for things like retaining walls, else they might be crushed to recycle gravel and the steel reinforcing.|$|E

40|$|In most {{rail wheel}} contact cases, {{especially}} on curved rail tracks, additional stresses {{occur in the}} rail due to potential centrifugal force and cant deficiency. The localised high stress generated on the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the outer rail region could potentially cause fatigue crack initiation. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the outer rail region influenced by the lateral (L) and vertical (V) rail wheel contact loads and the contact position. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail under head radius position are of special interest as tension spikes were found at this location in the field measurements. The study was undertaken by the finite element method (FEM) with a static stress analysis. The analysis revealed that the longitudinal stress at the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the outer rail region is highly dependent on two factors: the offset of the contact patch location from the rail centreline and the L/V ratio. The peak tensile stress is increased, but the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile is reduced when increasing the offset of contact patch location and L/V ratio. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards into transverse defects.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this work}} is to improve {{understanding}} of wheel/rail lubricating mechanisms and propose an approach {{for use in the}} future to evaluate new lubricants suitable for the wheel flange/rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> contact. This work is carried out in the framework of the European research program "Urban Track" (project no FP 6 - 31312). Previous works on wheel-rail contacts have highlighted the presence of a natural third body composed of detached particles from both the wheel and the rail. In the case of the active (i. e. where wheel-rail contact occurs) rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> and the wheel flange contact, this third body is quickly mixed with the active flange lubricant, resulting in a mixture that can be considered as the "real" lubricant of the contact. Tribological tests are performed on a reduced scale simulator in view to investigating the formation of such a mixture and its range of action. Its rheology "in situ" is studied as is the detachment of particles (from rail and wheel specimens). The test conditions reproduced were close to those found in wheel-rail contacts, i. e. high shearing and pressure conditions. The migration and transport of the lubricant by the wheel specimen are highlighted during these tests and a "pasty liquid" is quickly formed. It is assumed that this "liquid" is composed of detached particles mixed with the initial lubricant leading to the formation of a mixture whose flows allow the initialization of a smooth surface. The latter facilitates the actions of oil additives, leading to a low friction coefficient. This sequence may produce an "optimized" mixture formed in situ. This is coherent with analyses performed on site. Hence it is necessary to reconstitute a specific surface of the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner,</b> i. e. the right third body for lubrication...|$|E

40|$|Rail and wheel wear {{are major}} {{components}} of operating costs with all rail operators and infrastructure owners. Wayside lubrication methods {{are used to}} apply grease to the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the rails where it is picked up by train wheels passing through the lubricator site. Different methods and placement locations are currently being used in different rail networks to lubricate rail and wheel. Field investigations show that in many curves effective lubrication ends up within a few meters of wayside lubricator sites. Rail wheel maintenance and replacement costs are huge in most heavy haul networks. Change in placement location, equipment, quality of grease and rail wheel conditions influence the grease carry distance. A limited number of studies are available in literature on the lubrication transport mechanism while a detailed study on modelling of the grease transport mechanism {{and the impact of}} the parameters mentioned above on grease transport has not yet been attempted. Further study is therefore required to clearly understand the grease/lubrication transport mechanism which is the key factor for the success of effective lubrication. Field trials and laboratory tests show wide variations in grease loss and carry distance due to the factors influencing the transport mechanism. Field and laboratory test data is analysed and a mathematical model is developed based on the findings for effective grease transport in this study.

40|$|Highly {{localized}} stresses generated at the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of {{the outer}} rail cause fatigue cracking. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail underhead radius position are of special interest, as tension spikes have been identified at this location during in-track measurements under high axle load conditions. The tension spike {{is a result of}} vertical and lateral head bending on the web. This effect is highly localized and is additional to the stresses generated due to vertical and lateral bending of the whole rail profile (the so-called global bending). This study examined contact and bending stresses by modelling the rail on a discrete foundation using finite elements and by considering the loading to be a fully slipping elliptical Hertzian contact patch. The analysis revealed that the tensile longitudinal stress was highly dependent on several service conditions: the contact patch offset from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and seasonal temperature variations. The tension spike increases, and the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile reduces, as the contact patch offset and/or the L/V ratio increases. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards and become transverse defects. This is because an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can facilitate cracks to turn perpendicular to the tensile stresses once they reach a critical length. Shear traction towards the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> was found to be the most damaging phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of tensile stresses in the underhead {{region as a}} result of localised vertical and lateral head bending on the web is significant, and can potentially contribute to fatigue cracking. Field measurements under heavy haul conditions have shown that these stresses occur as a tension spike when the instrumented location is directly beneath the wheel. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the stress state of the rail underhead region with respect to changes of the rail profile due to wear. The study was undertaken using the finite element method (FEM) involving static stress analysis. The analysis revealed that the longitudinal stress at the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the outer rail in curved track is highly dependent on several operational parameters including the offset of the contact patch location from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads (L/V ratio), the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and the head wear (HW). The magnitude of the tension spike at the surface of the rail in the underhead region is increased, but the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile is reduced when increasing the offset of contact patch location, the L/V ratio, the foundation stiffness and the HW. Both residual (RS) and thermally induced stresses increase the value of the stress in this region. The tensile stresses could potentially cause fatigue crack initiation at the rail underhead region and, in particular, could cause rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks on the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the rail to turn downwards into transverse defects (TDs) ...|$|E

A new EMAT has been designed that allows the low weight and flexible EMAT coil to skim over the sample surface, while the heavier and bulkier magnet behind the coil has a lift-off that can vary over 10 mm whilst still achieving a reasonable SNR.

40|$|The {{probability}} of catastrophic rail failure {{as a result}} of the propagation of surface-initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks to form transverse defects (TDs) is of ongoing concern to the rail industry, especially since the Hatfield incident in the UK in 2000. The heavy haul sector is not immune to such concerns, as the combination of improved rail steels and optimisation of the wheel-rail interface has reduced the extent to which rail wear influences rail life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the growth behaviour of <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> cracking (GCC), and in particular, the tendency for rails to break with a rapid fracture, under the high axle load conditions typical of those that exist in Australian heavy haul operations. Previous work has shown that the occurrence of tension spikes {{as a result of}} localised vertical and lateral head bending on the web were significant in the understanding of this behaviour, which is exacerbated with increasing rail head wear (HW), such that the occurrence of the rapid fracture associated with this behaviour correlates with the extent of rail HW. This behaviour was examined using finite element (FE) modelling, which had previously been validated by comparison with in-track measurements to verify the prediction of the tension spikes. The FE model used a single rail on a discrete elastic foundation to parametrically study the growth behaviour of RCF damage subjected to changes in the rail HW; the contact patch offset (CPO) from the rail centreline, the (UV) ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, foundation stiffness and the thermal stresses. The FE results reveal that existing GCC, when subjected to high tensile stresses at the underhead radius (UHR) and the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> region, can contribute to the development of rapid (unstable) fracture. The results of this work can be used to examine the influence of wheel-rail interaction behaviour and rail HW on the {{probability of}} catastrophic rail failure from RCF damage...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Sound {{pressure}} levels exceeding {{acceptable limits}} are being generated by trains travelling on the 1000 m radius curved railway line past {{the town of}} Elands Bay. Unacceptable sound levels are attributed mainly to top of rail wheel squeal. Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In small radius curves, saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large curve radius and the utilisation of self-steering bogies on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, curve squeal is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m radius curved railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large radius curves are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large radius curves. Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m radius curves at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the large radius curve. The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m radius curve at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in small radius curves. Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal curve squeal, loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband flanging noise. It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The curve squeal noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|E

These waves propagate along the surface of the rail, penetrating to a depth of approximately 2 - 15 mm. The surface wave generated is wideband, containing a range of frequencies in one single pulse. Crack depth can be estimated by comparing the surface wave at a particular frequency that has passed underneath the crack with a wave propagated through a defect-free region. Preliminary measurements indicate that the ultrasonic system has the potential to assess the microstructure-stress state around the rail head, thus identifying precursors to crack formation...|$|E

Mode I branch cracks arising from these are similarly believed to correspond to the generation of a transverse defect. <b>Gauge</b> <b>corner</b> shear stresses from the finite element analysis are used together with threshold stress intensity factor ranges from the fatigue tests on standard carbon rail in a fracture mechanics model of the transition from a shell to a transverse defect.

It has been reported in the literature that the application of traction fluid (a modern technique involving the use of a synthetic lubricant) produced a higher coefficient of friction than that of a conventional wheel/rail interface lubricant. In this study, tests were performed using traction fluid to evaluate its influence on a vehicle’s braking distance and other important performance elements from a practical point of view.

We use electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to generate and detect the ultrasound. These have the advantage of being non-contact and require no couplant. It is not sufficient to merely detect the presence of a defect; hence accurate calibration of the system is required. We present measurements on calibration samples giving the response of the system to defects of different depths. Further experiments have been performed on rail samples containing real and manufactured PF defects, both longitudinal and transverse. Using the change in signal amplitude and frequency content we are able to give a depth and position for these defects, and these are compared with more established measurement methods. An enhancement of the signal when the receive EMAT is close to the defect is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect defects in rail, and in {{particular}} surface defects such as <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> cracking, is essential. Current ultrasonic testing of the rail uses contacting transducers in a send-receive mode which are at present limited in testing speed to around 20 - 30 mph, and signals from serious surface defects may be masked by nearby shallow surface defects. Using Rayleigh-like surface waves generated and detected in a pitch-catch manner we can overcome {{the effect of this}} masking, and by using electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) working at a small standoff {{we may be able to}} lift many of the current rail testing speed limitations with a high accuracy for detecting and gauging surface defects. We present experiments on rail samples with real and machined defects, using EMATs to generate and detect a low-frequency wide-band surface wave. The depths of the defects can be characterised through analysis of both the time domain signal amplitude and frequency dependent behaviour. The design of EMAT used is discussed, with consideration of signal, frequency content, directionality of the signal and the effect of standoff above the sample. ...|$|E
40|$|Tools for the {{prediction}} of crack growth in rails are of vital importance for the railway industry. In this paper, numerical simulations of crack growth in rails are presented. More specifically, {{the focus is on}} short surface head check like cracks, often observed at the rail <b>gauge</b> <b>corner.</b> A fatigue crack propagation model expressed in terms of a crack driving force, derived from the concept of material forces, is presented. It is shown that only the component parallel to the crack tip of the crack driving force is a reliable quantity {{that can be used in}} numerical simulations of a Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) situation. In addition, it is shown that one term in the expression of the crack driving force (Gsur) is dependent on the computational mesh. The propagation model has been used for parametric studies of crack propagation to investigate key parameters such as loading and crack geometry. Results from these studies suggest that anisotropic effects from the highly deformed surface layer may need to be included in order to simulate head check growth in rails accurately...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{procedure}} for numerical simulation of rail wear {{and the corresponding}} profile evo-lution has been formulated. The wear {{is assumed to be}} uniform {{in the sense that the}} profiles remain constant along the track portion to be investigated. A simulation set is selected defining the vehicles running on the track, their operating conditions, and contact parameters. Several variations of input data may be included together with the corresponding occurrence probability. Simulation of multi-body dynamics is used to calculate contact forces and positions, and Archard’s wear equation is applied for the calculation of wear depth. Wear coefficients as a function of contact pressure and relative sliding velocity are collected from different test results. Trial calculations of four non-lubricated and two lubricated curves with radii from 303 to 802 m show qualitatively reasonable results in terms of profile shape development and difference in wear mechanisms between <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> and rail head. The wear rates related to traffic tonnage are, however, overestimated and the lubrication efficiency underestimated. It is expected that model refinements in terms of environmental influence and contact stress calculation are useful to improve the quantitative results...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of {{temperatures in the}} contact zone at the wheel and rail interface {{is a very complex}} and important issue for multidisciplinary studies. The knowledge of temperature in the contact interface between two bodies and with the possible presence of a third body layer allows making informed judgments on processes in areas such as lubricant choice, wear estimation, life cycle prediction, etc. This paper is focused on the development of a temperature modelling methodology in Gensys multibody code which also presents its implementation for the study of temperatures at various common areas of contact (top of rail, <b>gauge</b> <b>corner</b> and gauge face contacts). Under normal operational practice, all these contact areas have different coefficients of friction which should be characterised as velocity and slip dependant variables. In order to show the workability of the developed methodology, numerical experiments for a heavy haul locomotive equipped with a simplified bogie traction control has been performed on curved track, where a locomotive has been operated under maximum traction forces and with longitudinal and lateral coupler forces attached in order to take into account train dynamics. For these experiments, both new and worn rail profiles have been used. Limitations of the proposed methodology as well as proposed future work and further improvements are discussed...|$|E
