40|$|Much of {{our modern}} maize {{germplasm}} was originally {{brought about by}} the combination of northern flint lines and southern dent lines.

40|$|Most maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids {{cultivated}} in Europe follow the heterotic pattern European <b>flint</b> × <b>Corn</b> Belt dent. However, at present, no commercial hybrids {{have been obtained}} from European flint inbreds exclusively. A flint × flint heterotic pattern could be an alternative to use in breeding programs to obtain early maturity, high-yielding hybrids, potentially useful for producing high quality flours. The objective of this work was to search for heterotic patterns within flint germplasm adapted to temperate conditions. Ten open-pollinated flint maize cultivars were crossed in a diallel design without reciprocals and evaluated in four environments in northwestern Spain. Cultivar effects explained most of the sum of squares for traits analyzed, except for yield. Crosses yielded 30 % more than parental cultivars. Yield of crosses ranged from 3. 94 to 5. 61 Mg ha− 1 Midparent heterosis values ranged from 2. 5 to 64. 7 %. The crosses ‘Gallego’ × ‘Basto/Enano Levantino’ and Basto/Enano Levantino × ‘Longfellow’ showed high heterosis and the best averages for grain yield. On {{the basis of these}} results, these crosses could be included in a recurrent reciprocal selection breeding program to increase heterosis among the cultivars and improve their hybrids. A cluster analysis made with midparent heterosis for grain yield as a measure of distance revealed that the flint germplasm probably had similar origins and were related to the ‘Northern Flint’ race. Some differences among these cultivars were detected. ‘Norteño Largo’ was closely related to Northern Flint, while Basto/Enano Levantino was {{different from the rest of}} the cultivars.

A sufficiently large number of kinds have been under test to prove beyond question that all of the best flint varieties, the smaller dents and the semi-dents will fully mature in the locality of the Experiment Station, the extreme northern portion of the State; but the climatic conditions cannot be considered as especially favorable to corn growing, the seasons being rather too short and the general temperature too low for the medium and larger dents to be successfully cultivated. The most unfavorable condition comes from the regularity of the cool nights, one of suitable temperature for the best growth of corn being the exception. It is the tendency of all dents after being grown a few years in this climate to take on the appearance of flints. In the whole ten seasons {{there has not been a}} single failure of the flint and small dent varieties on the Station farm.

The regular night winds from this source undoubtedly delay the coming of the frosts of early fall. However, as a rule, the corn has been too far advanced when the first light frost came in less favored localities to have received any injury from this source.
