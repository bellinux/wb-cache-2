6000|$|It was so {{remarkable}} that our friend had pulled up before his hostess with {{the vision of}} it; he had risen from his chair {{at the end of}} ten minutes and begun, as a help not to worry, to move about before her quite as he moved before Maria. He had kept his appointment with her to the minute and had been intensely impatient, though divided in truth between the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of having nothing at all. The short interval had, in the face of their complication, multiplied his impressions--it being meanwhile to be noted, moreover, that he already frankly, already almost publicly, viewed the complication as common to them. If Madame de Vionnet, under Sarah's eyes, had pulled him into her boat, there was by this time no doubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really most been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the vessel itself. They were in it together this moment as they hadn't yet been, and he hadn't at present uttered the least of the words of alarm or remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel. He had other things to say to her than that she had put him in a position; so quickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly, altogether richly, inevitable. That the outlook, however--given the point of exposure--hadn't cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was the first warning she received from him on his arrival. She had replied with indulgence that he was in too great a hurry, and had remarked soothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely HE might be. He felt her presence, on the spot, he felt her tone and everything about her, as an aid to that effort; and it was perhaps one of the proofs of her success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they talked. By the time he had explained to her why his impressions, though multiplied, still baffled him, {{it was as if he}} had been familiarly talking for hours. They baffled him because Sarah--well, Sarah was deep, deeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself. He didn't say that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down, as it were, <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> and that, given Mrs. Newsome's profundity, the shaft thus sunk might well have a reach; but he wasn't without a resigned apprehension that, at such a rate of confidence between the two women, he was likely soon to be moved to show how already, at moments, it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with Mrs. Newsome. Sarah, to a certainty, would have begun herself to feel it in him--and this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more. From the moment she knew he COULD be tormented--! ...|$|E

The second was a French prince, Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans. Her mother preferred the French match as it would strengthen ties with a powerful neighbour who prior to Auguste's birth, had ravaged Baden-Baden. Auguste however preferred the German match due to her roots. Auguste, however gave <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and agreed to the match with Louis d'Orléans and there was a proxy ceremony held at the Schloss Rastatt before she was married on 13 July 1724 Louis d'Orléans, the grandson of Louis XIV of France.

5000|$|Ramabai {{was also}} a poet and scholar. During her life, Ramabai {{traveled}} widely. In order {{to learn more about}} the education of women and receive training for her lifelong battle to help unshackle the women in India, she visited most parts of India.She went to Britain (1883) to start medical training. During her stay she converted to Christianity. From Britain she traveled to United States to attend the graduation of the first female Indian doctor, Anandibai Joshi (1886 - 88). During this time she also translated textbooks and gave lectures throughout the United States and Canada. Her lectures in USA led to Ramabai associations being formed in all major American cities to raise funds for her causes. She also found time to write and get published one of her most important books, The High-Caste Hindu Woman. This was also the first book that she wrote in English. Ramabai dedicated this book to Dr. Anandibai Joshi, who died in February 1887, less than six months after returning to India from America. The High Caste Hindu Woman, which, according to her beliefs, [...] "showed" [...] the darkest aspects of the life of Hindu women, including child brides and child widows, sought to expose the oppression of women in Hindu-dominated British India.In 1896, during a severe famine Ramabai toured the villages of Maharashtra with a caravan of bullock carts and rescued thousands of outcast children, child widows, orphans, and other destitute women and brought them to the shelter of Mukti and Sharada Sadan. A learned woman knowing seven languages, she also translated the Bible <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> tongue - Marathi - from the original Hebrew and Greek.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the neuropsychological and neurolinguistic {{features}} of a bilingual patient, E. M., who presented with an uncommon pattern of aphasic deficit consequent to subcortical lesions mainly involving the left basal ganglia. Not only are reports of bilingual subcortical aphasia rare, but E. M. 's deficit is particularly uncommon for it concerns the most used mother tongue (Venetian) {{much more than a}} less practiced second language (standard Italian). In this patient, the linguistic deficit in mother tongue production has been observed in spontaneous speech and in cross language translation tasks, where an asymmetrical paradoxical performance has been revealed. Indeed, unlike neurologically intact subjects, E. M. has more difficulties when translating <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> tongue than into her second language. Although E. M. 's mother tongue is prevalently an oral language, the asymmetrical translation pattern is similar in written and oral translation tasks, thus ruling out the possibility that the deficit simply reflects differences between written and oral language codes. Finally, another remarkable feature of E. M. 's impairment is its stability over almost 5 years from the stroke. We propose that this unusual type of recovery in E. M. is related to the higher degree of automatization of the first language with respect to the second one. This proposal fits with the role of basal ganglia in automatized motor and cognitive performance...|$|E
