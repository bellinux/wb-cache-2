40|$|This paper reexamines {{growth in}} {{transition}} using panel data to 1997. It suggests that output <b>has</b> <b>been</b> strongly affected by export market growth; that inflation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> weaker output only above a threshold inflation rate; that structural reform <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> weaker output initially, {{but that it}} stimulates higher growth thereafter; and that rapid disinflation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> output losses only {{in the presence of}} pegged exchange rates. ...|$|R
25|$|High-dose (10mg/day) NET <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> hepatic veno-occlusive disease, {{and because}} of this adverse effect, NET should not be given to {{patients}} undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} famous trains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> King's Cross, {{such as the}} Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh. The Gresley A3 and later {{streamlined}} A4 Pacific steam locomotives handled express services from the 1930s until 1966.

5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As {{in the case of}} progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He {{probably}} owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.|$|E

WHIM like {{mutations}} in CXCR4 were recently identified {{in patients with}} Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a B-cell malignancy.

5|$|Diuretics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> {{attacks of}} gout. However, a low dose of {{hydrochlorothiazide}} {{does not seem}} to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This {{may be because}} they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of}} an increase in glucagon levels.|$|E

5|$|Links between other {{infections and}} GBS are less certain. Two other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus/HHV-4 and {{varicella}} zoster virus/HHV-3) and the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> GBS. The tropical viral infection dengue fever and Zika virus {{have also been}} associated with episodes of GBS.

5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a 3 to 5 {{times higher}} risk of {{developing}} Alzheimer's disease.

5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> familial hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
