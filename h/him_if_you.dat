500|$|Rajab's {{lawyer said}} {{the verdict was}} {{unexpected}} because the charge of insult was normally punished by a fine. Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch and nineteen members of the United States Congress called for Rajab's release. Four Bahraini rights group issued a joint statement condemning the sentence and five political parties held a sit-in in solidarity with Rajab. Yousif al-Mahafdha of BCHR said [...] "hey arrested him {{to send a message}} to all activists that you will get arrested like <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> talk to the media".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've {{never been in a}} situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> try to force him {{to do what you want}} creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

500|$|The both {{versions}} of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, {{in order to make}} the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with acrylic paint and then digitized by the Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created [...] "huge" [...] DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256 color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors). The game also uses various digitized sound effects. Allison said, [...] "there were whole sections that never made it in, like a roller skating frankenstein, that shattered into loads of tiny versions of <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> 'killed' him, I did the sprites etc, it just never made it to the game." ...|$|E

He knew I wasn’t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. It was just me being me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richthofen was a {{brilliant}} tactician, building on Boelcke's tactics. Unlike Boelcke, however, he led by example and force of will rather than by inspiration. He was often described as distant, unemotional, and rather humorless, though some colleagues contended otherwise. He taught his pilots the basic rule which {{he wanted them to}} fight by: [...] "Aim for the man and don't miss <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are fighting a two-seater, get the observer first; until you have silenced the gun, don't bother about the pilot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bemies is {{best known}} for his role as a pioneer of college basketball. [...] In 1892, after {{witnessing}} an exhibition basketball game arranged by Naismith in Springfield, Bemies formed the first college basketball team at Geneva College. [...] Under Bemies' guidance, Geneva College became the first college in the United States to field a basketball team. [...] Interviewed in 2010, Ian Naismith, a basketball historian and the grandson of the sport's inventor, sought to settle disputing claims as to which college was the first to introduce basketball. [...] Naismith said, [...] "My grandfather considered Geneva to be the birthplace of college basketball, and how can anybody argue with <b>him?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> say anything differently, you're calling my grandfather, my father, and me, liars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Zhou Yu died, he, {{along with}} Gan Ning and others, had {{constantly}} urged Sun Quan to attack Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for {{an invasion of}} Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan, [...] "Liu Zhang and I {{are members of the}} imperial clan, so we should strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors' blessings. Now, when I heard that Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don't dare to probe further. I hope you can show leniency towards <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't, I'll retire and return to the countryside." [...] Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked, [...] "This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|George and Evangelia were an ill-matched {{couple from}} the beginning; he was easy-going and unambitious, with no {{interest}} in the arts, while his wife was vivacious and socially ambitious, and had held dreams of a life in the arts for herself, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth. Evangelia's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852-1916), was in failing health when Evangelia introduced George to her family and Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, [...] "You will never be happy with <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> marry this man, I {{will never be able to}} help you". Evangelia had ignored his warning, but soon realized that her father was right. The situation was aggravated by George's philandering and was improved neither by the birth of a daughter, named Yakinthi (later called Jackie), in 1917 nor the birth of a son, named Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis's death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage. In 1923, after realizing that Evangelia was pregnant again, George made the unilateral decision to move his family to America, a decision which Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Evangelia [...] "shouting hysterically" [...] followed by George [...] "slamming doors". The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in Astoria, Queens.|$|E

2500|$|In chapter 33 of the novel, Guo Jia was {{accompanying}} Cao Cao on {{his campaign}} against the Yuan brothers (Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi) and the Wuhuan when he fell sick {{because he could not}} adjust to the climate. He advised Cao Cao to leave the heavy baggage behind and launch a swift attack on the enemy with a light force, which resulted in Cao's victory later at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Guo Jia remained in Yizhou (易州) to recover and did not follow Cao Cao to the frontline. When Cao Cao returned to Yizhou later, he was deeply grieved to hear that Guo Jia had already died several days ago. Before his death, Guo Jia wrote Cao Cao a note, whose contents were not revealed until later in the chapter. When Cao Cao received news that Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi had fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, his subordinates urged him to either attack Liaodong or return to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), but Cao told them to wait until they had received the Yuan brothers' heads. Just then, Cao Cao heard that Gongsun Kang had captured and killed the Yuan brothers and sent their heads to him, and his followers were very surprised. Cao Cao then revealed Guo Jia's note, which stated: [...] "I heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had fled to Liaodong. You should not mobilise the army. Gongsun Kang had long feared that the Yuans would conquer his territory so he would definitely feel suspicious when the Yuan brothers join <b>him.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> attack them, they will unite to resist you and you cannot overcome them quickly; if you do not move, Gongsun Kang and the Yuans will fight each other, and this is definite." ...|$|E
