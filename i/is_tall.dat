5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side the cliff <b>is</b> <b>tall,</b> , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned {{just behind the}} pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of the {{lacrimal}} is a rounded square with both faces of the bone are concave. Its contact with the nasal is rather limited in both species. The oval-shaped antorbital fenestra is small, being only 9% the length of the eye socket; its presence is unique to both species of the genus among atoposaurids. Meanwhile, the eye socket is large and oval, being 54% longer than it <b>is</b> <b>tall.</b> The drop-shaped palpebrals project out from the tops of the eye sockets. In both species, the back two-thirds of the inner surface of the palpebral is slightly concave. Both species have a squamosal in which the back third is bevelled; in K. langenbergensis, the outer margin is somewhat convex.|$|E

5|$|The second cross <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) {{and a free}} armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase once it <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> enough {{to escape the}} water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it {{is most likely to}} run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
40|$|Subjects {{learned and}} {{answered}} questions about four-or six-term linear orderings (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Dick, who <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam, mho <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Pete). Such an ordering {{is comprised of}} some adjacent pairwise relations {{that are necessary to}} the establishment of the ordering (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Dick, Dick <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam), and some remote relations that are deducible (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam). Except for unusually fast responses to test sentences beginning with an end term, reaction time was a monotonic decreasing function of remoteness; the more remote the shorter the reaction time. This result contradicts several current models of how meaningful information is stored. First, it contranicts any model which argues that subjects do not store deducible information. Information pertaining to the deducible remote pairs is stored along with the information that was actually presented. Second, it contradicts any model which describes the form of the stored information in terms of inter-item associations. A model which can account for the result is presented. (Author...|$|R

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by}} a low midline ridge running to the second dorsal fin. The second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first dorsal fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and positioned slightly {{closer to the}} pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the Logical Form of these examples, {{it is important}} to identify what the basic predicate is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the property of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who <b>is</b> <b>tall,</b> otherwise the truth value is False.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals has been over the Haha–Hung pair.

This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.|$|E
