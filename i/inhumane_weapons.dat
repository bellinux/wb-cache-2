40|$|It’s a pity {{that his}} own country won’t embrace Gareth Evans and his passion to {{eliminate}} nuclear weapons, writes GEOFFREY BARKER He’s older and grayer and his beard has shrunk to a well-tended goatee. But Gareth Evans is still impatient, impassioned and doubtless impossible at times as he maintains his rage against {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD). The former Labor foreign affairs minister, now president of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, was in Canberra on Thursday to deliver the inaugural John Gee memorial lecture to commemorate the Australian scientist and foreign affairs official who died earlier this year. Characteristically, Evans spoke at great length and in encyclopaedic detail about the overwhelmingly sorry state of international efforts to rid the world of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. His work in Brussels and his personal commitment ensures that he remains an angry, engaged participant in international efforts to eliminate WMD Now 63, Evans hardly seems to have mellowed in the ten years since he left Australian politics after 21 years’ service including thirteen years in senior ministerial posts. He is a totemic reminder that {{there was a time when}} an Australian minister could pour national, personal, intellectual and emotional resources into trying to address the great issue of human survival. We may be poorer for the passing of that time. The final report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, set up and run by Evans from 1995 until Labor’s defeat in 1996, remains one of the most idealistic documents produced by an Australian government. It was quickly set aside by the incoming Howard government. Evans’s arrival in Canberra this week coincided with the announcement by John Howard that Australia would sell uranium to India outside the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Curiously the media seemed hardly interested in Evans’s views, presumably regarding him as being of no news interest - a view that is hard to understand given the international influence of the International Crisis Group. Evans perhaps surprised his audience by saying there was nothing wrong in principle in countries’ negotiating special arrangements to draw outlying countries like India into international nuclear non-proliferation arrangements, including having them accept intrusive monitoring of their activities. “But everything”, Evans said, “depends on what the terms of those agreements are. ” Evans was unimpressed by the recent agreement between the United States and India for the transfer of nuclear fuel and technology. He said the agreement had been rightly criticised for giving India too much access to US fuel and technology without demanding that India stop production of weapons or fissile material, promise not to expand its nuclear arsenal, and pledge not to resume nuclear tests. “From what I saw about the just-announced Australian government intention to allow uranium shipments to India, it would involve none of those things either,” Evans said. He said the agreement appeared to require only “minimal traditional assurances” - but no promises to avoid production of fissile material and no promises not to resume nuclear testing. “That should be made unacceptable,” Evans said. Evans revealed a generally pessimistic view of international progress towards the elimination of WMD. The Chemical Weapons Convention was the only “good news” story, although stockpiles had not been significantly reduced and the US and Russia claimed that technical difficulties prevented them from reducing chemical weapons stocks. Moreover there was not much progress towards an effective international Biological Weapons Convention. But, he said, nuclear weapons remained the overwhelming preoccupation of rational people around the world. They were, he said, the most <b>inhumane</b> <b>weapons</b> and capable of indiscriminate, vast-scale and long-lasting devastation. Evans pointed out that nuclear stockpiles remain high. (According to the US Arms Control Association the United States and Russia still hold a total of some 16000 warheads. the US with 11, 000 and Russia with 5000.) He said that there had been a loss of direction in disarmament efforts over the last decade and less treaty-making. He was doubtful that things would be better if a Democrat replaced President George Bush, saying that Democrat candidate Barak Obama had retreated from a no-first-use position when Hilary Clinton insisted the United States should always keep adversaries guessing about its intentions. Evans strongly endorsed the call for a nuclear weapons-free world made in January this year by Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of State George Schultz, former US defence secretary William Perry and former Senator Sam Nunn. He called for a change to the posture of deployed nuclear weapons, reductions in the size of nuclear forces, elimination of short-range weapons, controlling uranium enrichment, and halting production of fissile material. “Get serious about nuclear disarmament, about the elimination of nuclear weapons,” Evans urged. “Get serious about overcoming weaknesses in existing non-proliferation regimes,” he said. The commitment of existing nuclear states under the NPT to move to total disarmament is being ignored as they moved to develop new classes of nuclear weapons, according to Evans. He said low political calculation would always trump idealism in the double standards game of charades played by nuclear weapons states. Evans reminded his audience of the two key findings of the Canberra Commission. First, so long as one state had nuclear weapons others would want them; second, nuclear weapons could not be uninvented, but they could be outlawed and their use be made unthinkable. In Australia, Evans’s speech perhaps did sound like a blast from the early 1990 s, but that may reflect the narrow provincialism of the contemporary Australian political debate. Evans is in fact fully aligned with the current views of the Americans Kissinger, Shultz, Perry and Nunn - hardly dangerous leftists or dreamy idealists in the world of global foreign policy. For all his hand waving and unyielding enthusiasm, or perhaps because of it, Evans is an Australian gift to the world. It is a pity {{that his own}} country, and its current government, is too small to embrace him and his passion to eliminate nuclear weapons. • Geoffrey Barker is a senior foreign affairs and defence policy columnist for the Australian Financial Review.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War the {{majority}} of armed conflicts has no longer been fought between states but takes place within the territory of a single state. At least one non-state armed group (NSAG) is involved. In such conflicts NSAGs challenge state- and peace-building processes with violent or criminal acts. Furthermore, by directly affecting peoples’ physical security and by undermining state authority they also pose a dangerous threat to human security. The daily life of many civilians is severely endangered by their existence. One violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) which is committed by nonstate armed groups is the use of anti-personnel mines (AP mines or APMs). APMs are indiscriminate and <b>inhumane</b> <b>weapons.</b> They still maim and kill ordinary people every day: Hardly any other weapon claims so many human lives. Consequently, in 1997 the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti- Personnel Mines and on their Destruction was adopted. The so-called Ottawa-Treaty completely bans all anti-personnel mines. Despite this, the goal of a world free of mines is still not realized. While {{it is true that the}} number of states using APMs has decreased in the last decade, APMs are, nonetheless, far more frequently deployed by non-state actors. Armed groups often have fewer military resources than states, and are therefore more likely to resort to the use of landmines. In spite of its significance, the Ottawa Treaty provides no opportunity for NSAGs to express their willingness to abide by its norms. However, the findings above demonstrate that global norms such as the ban of anti-personnel mines, must also apply for NSAGs in order to achieve a mine-free world. Besides, empirical evidence shows that it is quite possible to bind non-state actors to humanitarian norms. One pioneering initiative in engaging NSAGs is Geneva Call, an NGO based in Geneva, Switzerland. Since 2000, the organization is dedicated to engage armed non-state actors towards compliance with the norms of international humanitarian law and human rights law, starting with a total ban on anti-personnel mines. The engagement of the NGOs began with the development of a Deed of Commitment for Adherence to a Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines and for Cooperation in Mine Action (referred to below as the Deed of Commitment, DoC). Through signing the Deed of Commitment armed groups commit themselves to stop the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines. In addition a ban on AP mines and the general idea of humanitarian norms, the Deed of Commitment also specifies implementation and monitoring mechanisms. In this way, Geneva Call involves NSAGs directly in obligations to observe humanitarian norms. Negotiations between Geneva Call and armed groups are often meetings of a special kind: Most recently, in June 2009 representatives of 28 NSAGs met in Geneva and discussed possibilities for binding armed groups to IHL. Since its launch, Geneva Call has engaged in dialogue with more than 60 NSAGs worldwide. Of these, so far 41 groups from Asia, Europe and Africa have signed the Deed of Commitment. Geneva Call 2 ̆ 7 s engagement is outstanding in two ways: On the one hand, the NGO functions as a norm entrepreneur vis-à-vis non-state armed actors and not (like other NGOs) vis-à-vis states or corporations. On the other hand, with the DoC Geneva Call has established an innovative mechanism, with which NSAGs can commit themselves to humanitarian law and for the first time become signatories to an internationally respected treaty. The very notion of an adherence to the mine ban norm by NSAGs seems at first glance to contradict the conventional assumption that NSAGs have in principle only limited interest in accepting norms, because they do not regard themselves as bound by international treaties. However, latest the success of Geneva Call shows that non-state armed groups can no longer be regarded only as a challenger to peace governance. By signing the Deed of Commitment, NSAGs are achieving a new position in a global normative order. Because successful integration of NSAGs requires comprehensive understanding of these groups, the present report asks how a norm acceptance by NSAGs can be explained. If we learn more about the conditions under which integration of these actors proceeds successfully, recommendations for practice can also be worked out. Thus, the goal was to investigate why NSAGs voluntarily commit themselves to humanitarian norms. For this purpose, with the help of process-analytic procedures the norm acceptance of one NSAG – the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) – was investigated. As one of the first NSAGs to do so, the SPLM/A signed the Deed of Commitment in 2001, although at that time it was still engaged in conflict with the government. The analysis showed that a number of factors played a role in their acceptance of the norm. On the one hand, transnational pressure influenced the decision of the SPLM/A to sign the DoC. Transnational strategies of shaming them had an influence on this NSAG, particularly because they had a strong need for legitimacy and consequently feared a loss of reputation. The analysis also showed that a “shadow of future statehood” not only increases an NSAG’s need for legitimacy but also raises their awareness about the material costs a later assumption of power would entail. Their concern that they would not be able to carry out the rebuilding of their country on their own contributed decisively to the norm acceptance by the SPLM/A. In the case investigated in this report, finally, humanitarian issues also played a role in the signing of the Deed of Commitment. Within the NSAG, it was primarily the function of two former SPLM/A commanders which was decisive. These two played the role of norm entrepreneurs within the movement, and directed the attention of the SPLM/A leadership to negative consequences of the use of landmines. Consequently, no single explanatory factor can be identified for the norm acceptance by the SPLM/A. Instead, the signing of the Deed of Commitment can be attributed to a combination of factors, each of which accounts for the decision to accept the norm. The results obtained make it possible to draw a few conclusions on possible starting points for the international community for possible engagement strategies with non-state armed groups. On the one hand, it seems promising to change the cost-benefit calculation of the norm-violating NSAG in such a way that the costs of norm violation exceed its benefits. This is possible by denouncing an NSAG so that it is concerned about its reputation; but may also be possible if external actors threaten to withdraw their (financial) support in the event of a further norm violation. The offer to support an NSAG in clearing mines in the area they control can decisively influence its renunciation of AP mines. On the other hand, the example of the SPLM/A shows, that an NSAG can also be convinced of the appropriateness of a norm through dialog. The finding also suggests that governance initiatives beyond a state-centered, hierarchical and repressive mode of governance are more effective in dealing with nonstate armed actors: For NGOs questions of state sovereignty and non-interference are not as decisive as these are to states. A possibility for state actors thus offers itself through the employment of NGOs for including non-state armed groups in a political order...|$|E
