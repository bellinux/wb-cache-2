5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make <b>electrical</b> <b>contact.</b> The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
25|$|The {{wires that}} make up the {{thermocouple}} must be insulated from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> between the wires, or contact of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.|$|E
25|$|A {{current clamp}} {{is a type}} of {{transformer}} with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> {{are usually}} plated {{in order to}} prevent corrosion. Platings of {{detachable}} <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> experience wear because of the motion between contacts. Once the protecting platings have been worn out, <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> will fail rapidly due to corrosion or fretting corrosion. Therefore the wear resistance of the platings is a very important parameter for the long lifetime of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts.</b> Many measures which improve the wear resistance can diminish the conductivity of the platings. Due to the fact that platings of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> must have both a high wear resistance and a high electrical conductivity, the manufacturing of high performance platings of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> poses a great challenge. Our study shows firstly the correlation between the wear resistance of platings and lifetime of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> and then the measures, which improve the wear resistance without impairing the electrical performance of the contacts...|$|R

25|$|In any {{situation}} where energized equipment is in intimate <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> {{with a person}} or animal (such as swimming pools, surgery, electric milking machines, car washes, laundries, and many others), particular attention must be paid to elimination of stray voltages. Dry intact skin has a higher resistance than wet skin or a wound, so voltages {{that would otherwise be}} unnoticed become significant for a wet or surgical situation.|$|E
25|$|In the {{regulation}} of heating and cooling, thermostats that operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an <b>electrical</b> <b>contact.</b> In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the set point.|$|E
25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} is an electrochemical {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals is the driving force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{the initial}} {{substrate}} doping level, silicon nanowires present different percentage of porosity [15] which affects the basic mechanical and electrical properties of the nanostructure, influencing the depletion region, the band structure and charge traps as well as complicating the realization of proper <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> [16]. A reliable and robust approach to fabricate <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> on SiNWs is {{required in order to}} discriminate different contribution to measured electrical features arising from intrinsic properties of silicon nanowire or from spurious effects such as defective <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|R

25|$|It {{was known}} that the {{electrical}} connectors between the torpedoes and the internal tube door were unreliable and often required the torpedo crews to open and re-close the door to clean the connection before an <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> could be established. Kursks crew had not fired a torpedo for three years, and that torpedo was a much simpler battery-powered type. The crew had to complete specific maintenance steps {{on a regular basis}} and before firing a torpedo. This included cleaning the torpedo tube of lubricants, metal shavings, and dust that accumulate during long periods of inactivity.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes always contain, {{in addition to}} the anode foil, a cathode foil that serves as <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> to the electrolyte. This cathode foil is provided with a very thin, natural, air-originated oxide layer, which act also as a dielectric. Thus, the capacitor construction forms a series circuit of two capacitors, the capacitance of the anode foil CA and the cathode foil CK. As described above, the capacitance of the capacitor Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode capacitance CA when the cathode capacitance CK is approximately 10 times higher than the anode capacitance CA.|$|E
25|$|When wire {{insulation}} disintegrates, it {{can result in}} an unintended <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E

25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} {{occurs when}} two different metals have physical or <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E
25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 Î¼m, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E

500|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a wooden dowel with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires. [...] The dowels were helically grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position. [...] This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very {{close to each other}} without coming into <b>electrical</b> <b>contact.</b> [...] Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte. [...] Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and zinc windings were soldered. [...] These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, hooks and eyes for attaching to other cells. [...] This arrangement is depicted in figure 2.

500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining <b>electrical</b> <b>contact.</b> On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E

2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the overhead wire provided minimal <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|E
