While Gould does not outright reject this, he thinks it is a misleading {{way to think about}} the history of life. As above, with the example of horses, Gould argues that there has been no directional trend, but rather, a massive extinction in the horse lineage, with the surviving remnants happening to be largish grazers. So the appearance of a trend is generated by a reduction in heterogeneity. [...] "A trend which is hostage to one switch between life and death is no trend at all." [...] (p. 146) At the scale of complexity, the same applies. [...] "What we think of as a progressive increase in complexity is a change in the difference between the least and the most complex organism. It is a change in the spread of complexity." [...] (p. 146) Life starts in the simplest form that the constraints of chemistry and physics will allow, with bacteria probably close to that limit. [...] "So life starts at the minimum level of complexity. Since even now nearly everything that is alive is a bacterium, for the most part life has stayed that way." [...] (p. 146) But occasionally life builds a lineage that becomes more complex over time. There are no global evolutionary mechanisms that either prevent more complex organisms evolving from simpler ones, or that make it more likely to occur. Complexity tends to drift up because the point of life's origin is close to the physical lower bound. Such complex creatures are relatively less than bacteria, which still dominate life, but the difference between the simplest and most complex organisms tends to become greater over time. So the increased range is wholly undirected. Displayed as a <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> or histogram, the shape would be skewed to the right (i.e. positively skewed), with the mode near the left. Over time, the range would increase as average complexity drifts upwards. But the mode would remain at left, with the curve spreading to the right, because there is a wall imposed by the laws of the physical sciences to the left, but not to the right.|$|E
40|$|The {{amplitude}} of respiratory sinus arrhythmia was quantified as {{the ratio of}} the longest to the shortest R- R intervals in electrocardiograms recorded during deep inspirations and forced expirations in the supine position. The mean of the absolute differences between consecutive R—R intervals recorded during normal quiet breathing in a supine position was also calculated. Since these two tests measure only cardiac parasympathetic function, they were used to assess the resting vagal tone in 165 patients with diabetes mellitus and 116 healthy volunteers (controls). The <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> of resting vagal tone was Gaussian in the controls and was also negatively correlated with age and height. The <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> of resting vagal tone was skewed in the diabetic population where a majority of patients had low vagal tone. The correlation of vagal tone with age was stronger than in controls, but there was no correlation of vagal tone with height in diabetic patients. The mean resting vagal tone in diabetic patients was reduced by 40 %, and the whole <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> was also shifted to the left by 40 % relative to the control curve. It is concluded that there is a substantial impairment of cardiac vagal function in most diabetic patients, contrary to current belief. Clinical tests which include measurement of vagal tone may give a bias towards low values in diabetic patients because of the shift to the left in the distribution curve of vagal tone in the diabetic population. It may therefore be necessary to measure resting vagal tone separately using one of the two tests described here for critical interpretation of results of autonomic function test in diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|Frequency {{distribution}} curves can be {{indicative of}} the dynamics and evolutionary development of geomorphological systems. Normally distributed geomorphological data are a reliable indicator of the equilibrium fluctuations prevalent within such systems. This occurs, for example, when a delicate balance is established between various types of landforms and geomorphological processes. Landforms that exist in this geomorphological steady state can be properly called “equilibrium” structures. They show no permanent trends of either growth or destruction. On the contrary, a positively skewed <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> indicates a type of non-equilibrium conditions and non-linear relationships within geomorphological systems, {{which may be the}} result of major external energy inputs (particularly from tectonic uplift). This, in turn, gives rise to new and more complex higher-order landforms. These represent structures of growth, or evolution. Alternatively, a negatively skewed <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve,</b> also being a consequence of non-equilibrium conditions, indicates a lack of free energy in the system, which induces destruction of the existing landforms. Such landforms represent structures of degeneration. The fluvial landscape in the northwestern part of Hrvatsko Zagorje, portrayed in terms of an open system, has been used as the geomorphological framework for this study, the primary purpose of which was to apply frequency distribution curves in the interpretation of the processes influencing the creation and destruction of the landscape. Horizontal and vertical dissection, slope and other morphometric characteristics reflect the specific dynamics of the geomorphological processes, which relate a variety of landforms to their geologic framework and climate in the study area...|$|E

The periods of crises are followed by short intervals of in-creased diversification combined with a wider distribution of graptolite facies. Peaks of diversity show a regular downward trend by the end of the Pragian time. Lack of essential morphological novelties and decrease of taxonomic diversity are indicative of a biological regression of the group. Facies analysis of Late Silurian-Early Devonian deposits shows a substantial reduction of areas with typical grap-tolite shales and a simultaneous Increase of carbonate and tcrrigenlc sediments with mixed shelly-graptolite taphocoenoses. Decrease in carbonaceous organic matter may be evidence of an environmental change and reduction of microplankton bio-mass, the latter being the food resource for graptolites. Simplification of morph-ology to a single adaptive type, a great numerical abundance of Late Pragian po-pulations may be indicative of the loss of ecological flexibility.

To identify recent HIV- 1 infections, we evaluated and compared the performance of 4 sequence-based diversity measures including percent diversity, percent complexity, Shannon entropy and number of haplotypes targeting 13 genetic segments within the env gene of HIV- 1. A total of 597 diagnostic samples obtained in 2013 and 2015 from recently and chronically HIV- 1 infected individuals were selected.

In order to explain both the Martian highland crater morphology and population distribution, a fluvial process is proposed which is capable of removing the loose crater rim material. The resulting effect is to decrease the crater diameter, thereby causing the population curves to bendover.

40|$|Summary. After acute {{administration}} of ammonium chloride, infants 1 to 16 {{months of age}} were similar to older children in their capacity to acidify their urine. The infants had {{a higher rate of}} excretion of titratable acid and a lower rate of excretion of ammonium but were similar in their rate of ex-cretion of total hydrogen ion. Bicarbonate titrations performed in infants {{during the first year of}} life demonstrated a threshold ranging from 21. 5 to 22. 5 mmoles per L, maximal rate of reabsorption from 2. 6 to 2. 9 mmoles per 100 ml glomerular filtrate, and marked titration splay. A nephronic <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> of the ratio of glomerular filtration rate to tubular reabsorptive capacity dem-onstrated both heterogeneity and skewing to the right, suggesting the pres-ence of significant numbers of nephrons with low tubular transport capacity relative to filtration rate. It is suggested that the "physiologic acidosis " of the infant is due neither to a limited renal capacity to excrete hydrogen ion nor to a reduced capacity for reabsorption of bicarbonate, but rather to a low renal plasma bicarbonate threshold. Although the level of the threshold may relate to the kinetics of bicarbonate reabsorption during this period, it appears to be due at least in part to functional and morphologic heterogeneity of nephrons...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} factors {{obtained from}} X-ray refinement of proteins at high resolution show large variations from one structure to another. However, the B-values expressed in units of standard deviation about their mean value (B'-factor) at the C alpha atoms show remarkably characteristic frequency distribution. In {{all of the}} 110 proteins examined in this study, the frequency distribution exhibited a bimodal distribution. The peaks in the B'-factor frequency distribution occur at - 1. 1 and 0. 4 for a bin size of 0. 5. The peak at lower temperature factor corresponds largely to buried residues, whereas the peak at larger value corresponds to exposed residues. The distribution could be accurately described as a superposition of two Gaussian functions. The parameters describing the distribution are therefore characteristic of protein structures. The frequency distribution for a given amino acid over all the proteins also shows a similar bimodal distribution, although the areas under the two Gaussians differ from one amino acid to another. The area under the <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> for any interval in B'-factor represents the propensity of the amino acid to occur in that interval. This propensity is related both to the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the residue and the tendency of the residue to impose a different degree of rigidity on the polypeptide chain. The frequency distribution of stretches of high B'-factors departs appreciably from that expected for a random distribution. The correlation in the B-values of sequentially proximal residues is probably responsible for the bimodal distribution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnti-nutritional {{factors such}} as lectins, saponin, trypsin {{inhibitor}} and phytic acid are endogenous substances in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). In this study, the contents or activities of these anti-nutritional factors in fresh pods were detected in 56 selected cultivars. The results revealed significant difference within each factor in the tested cultivar population. The mean value of lectin content and the activity of trypsin inhibitor were 1. 743 [*]mg[*]⋅[*]g− 1 and 1. 680 [*]mg[*]⋅[*]g− 1 respectively. Their coefficients of variation (CV) were both more than 100 % {{and each of the}} cultivar <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> showed a main peak, but the discontinuous distributions in the extremely high and low areas indicate hierarchic cultivars. However, the mean contents of saponin and phytic acid were 3. 730 [*]mg[*]⋅[*]g− 1 and 3. 102 [*]mg[*]⋅[*]g− 1, respectively, with CV less than 41 %. Each showed a main peak in its normal distribution curve and low frequency continuous distribution in dual tails. Meanwhile, statistic analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the lectin content and trypsin inhibitor activity in fresh pods. Furthermore, all 56 tested cultivars were clustered into three groups based on their four anti-nutritional factor levels: 80 % of them into medium level group, and 12 % of them into low level group. The endogenous edible toxic compounds, such as lectin and trypsin inhibitor, are closely related to insect resistance in the field. This study suggests {{that it is possible to}} screen the cultivars containing less lectin and other factors but with reduced pest resistance in the field...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{agricultural}} surface irregularities are reported as sources of tractor vibrations. Farm surfaces are generally liable to change with repeated travel over them. The changes of field characteristics by traffic are evaluated by the changes of <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions,</b> power spectral densities and cone indexes. Power spectra of hard farm roads are measured and compared with ISO 2 ̆ 7 s generalised road classification. Power spectra of deformable farm lands are compared with several reports of other investigators. (1) Power spectral densities of farm fields had several conspicuous peaks in the road frequency range 0. 2 - 2. 5 (c/m). The peaks were caused by tractors or other agricultural machines. (2) On the deformable farm lands, the changes of the power spectral density curves by traffic were noticeable {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 2. 5 (c/m). The slopes of curves plotted on log-log scales were steeper in proportion to the numbers of passes of the same rut. (3) A <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> of the farm field roughness gave a straight line when plotted on normal probability papers. There was not a bit of difference between the <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> of the rut profiles for single tractor pass and those for two passes. (4) Power spectra of measured arables showed that all can be approximated by the well known simple relationship P(F) =CF^ (cm^ 2 /c/m). As the undulations of them were severer, the value of C was smaller and that of n was larger. The range of C was from 1. 0 to 10. 7 and that of n was from 0. 6 to 1. 5. Power spectral densities of unsurfaced farm roads fell in the lower end of class E in the ISO 2 ̆ 7 s classification. The mean values of C and n were 0. 48 and 1. 74 respectively. 農用車両振動源としてのほ場面おうとつは一般に車両走行によつて変化する. トラクタ走行によつてほ場特性が変化する過程を,おうとつの振幅分布,P,S. Dコーン指数の各値で調べた. また,変形しない農用道路のP. S. D. による分類を行つた. 1. ほ場面おうとつのP.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{data are available}} for many locations on an hourly basis. Simulation studies of solar energy systems have generally used these hourly values to estimate long-term annual performance, although solar radiation can exhibit wide variations during an hour. Variations in solar radiation during an hour, such as on a minute basis, could result in inaccurate performance estimates for some types of solar systems, such as photovoltaic systems, that respond quickly and non-linearly to solar radiation. In addition, diffuse fraction correlations and cumulative <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> have been developed using hourly data and the accuracy of these correlations when applied to short-term radiation has not been established. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the inaccuracies caused by using hourly rather than short time (i. e., minute and three minute) {{radiation data}} on the estimated performance of solar energy systems. The inaccuracies are determined by examination of the <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> and diffuse fraction relationships for short-term solar radiation data as compared to existing correlations and by comparing calculated radiation on tilted surfaces and utilizability based on hourly and short-term radiation data...|$|R
