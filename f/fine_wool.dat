5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, <b>fine</b> <b>wool</b> sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. <b>Fine</b> <b>wool</b> breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

40|$|Based on cointegration {{analysis}} and monthly data from 1976. 8 to 1999. 10, a long-run equilibrium relationship {{was found to}} exist between prices for wools of 19 to 23 microns, despite the wool Reserve Price Scheme operated until February 1991. Furthermore, the prices for 19, 20 and 21 micron wools {{were found to be}} weakly exogenous. The latter result suggested that, although co-integrated, prices for <b>finer</b> <b>wools</b> tended to be less volatile than coarser wools. The implications are that wool producers would enjoy more stable prices by producing <b>finer</b> <b>wools</b> and that cross-hedging is possible given co-movements of prices. cointegration, error correction model, reserve price scheme, wool marketing., Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R

The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.|$|E
25|$|Like many breeds of island sheep, Santa Cruz sheep are {{relatively}} small and extremely hardy: they are good foragers and need no assistance with lambing. However, because of the fine–wooled breeds that they are derived from, Santa Cruz sheep are unique among formerly feral island breeds in their medium to <b>fine</b> <b>wool</b> with a soft feel. Their fleeces are mostly white, but some colored sheep are known among the breed.|$|E
25|$|The Peppin {{brothers}} took {{a different}} approach to producing a hardier, longer-stapled, broader wool sheep. After purchasing Wanganella Station in the Riverina, they selected 200 station-bred ewes that thrived under local conditions and purchased 100 South Australian ewes bred at Cannally that were sired by an imported Rambouillet ram. The Peppin brothers mainly used Saxon and Rambouillet rams, importing four Rambouillet rams in 1860. One of these, Emperor, cut an 11.4lb (5.1kg clean) wool clip. They ran some Lincoln ewes, but their introduction into the flock is undocumented. In 1865, George Merriman founded the <b>fine</b> <b>wool</b> Merino Ravensworth Stud, part of which is the Merryville Stud at Yass, New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>wool</b> <b>finer</b> than 25 microns can be {{used for}} garments, while coarser grades are used for {{outerwear}} or rugs. The <b>finer</b> the <b>wool,</b> the softer it is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.|$|R

25|$|Most historians {{agree that}} far from being an ancient craft, Aran {{knitting}} was invented {{as recently as the}} 1890s and early 1900s, when the Congested Districts Board sought to improve the fishing industry in the Islands. Fishermen and their wives from other regions in the British Isles came to help train the islanders in better fishing and fish-processing skills, bringing with them an existing tradition of knitted guernsey jumpers. These guernsey jumpers have similar stitch patterns, though usually only on the yoke, and are worked in <b>fine</b> <b>wool</b> not available to the Aran Islanders. Enterprising local women began knitting their own version, using thicker local wool, all-over patterning, and different construction such as saddle-shoulders, rather than the more usual gusseted drop sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Carpets woven {{in towns}} and {{regional}} centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Mashhad, Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom {{are characterized by}} their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their <b>fine</b> <b>wool,</b> bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, {{as opposed to the}} artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Yemenite tallīt is {{a full-length}} tallīt made from <b>fine</b> <b>wool</b> or goat's hair {{of a single}} black or brown color, called šämläh, {{but it was not}} unique unto Jews alone. Muslims would also wear similar items of covering, to protect them from the heat or rain. Jewish garments, however, bore the ritual fringes prescribed for such garments. The wearing of such garments was not unique to prayer time alone, but was worn the entire day. Later, decorative black and white striped shawls were imported into the country from Europe, and which were highly valued by the Jews of Yemen who wore them on special occasions and on the Sabbath day. The small tallīt (ṭallīt kaṭan) was introduced into Yemen via Aden from European centers, and principally worn by rabbis and educated persons.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twenty}} years {{immediately}} after settlement, Hobart Town became {{a base for}} the Southern Ocean whaling and sealing industries. Hobart Town's shipyards built many of the whalers, and were kept busy with maintenance and repairs. Whale oil soon became a major export, and was used to light the street lamps of London, and the wool industry had also established itself as a major export from Hobart Town's docks. In 1816, there were 20,000 sheep, and by 1818, 12,000 horned cattle. Merino and other flocks were established in the now expanding Midlands district, and at Clarendon, Perth, Longford, Esk Vale, Jericho, Simmonds and elsewhere. Soon merino stud rams were being sold for high prices, and Van Diemen's Land became noted throughout the empire for its <b>fine</b> <b>wool.</b> Wheat crops were produced in such abundance that it was being exported to Sydney to subsidise their less successful crops. The Van Diemen's Land Company was formed in 1825 to raise sheep in the colony to provide wool for British cloth manufacturers who were then buying wool from Spain and Germany, as sheep bred in Britain were largely meat breeds.|$|E
