40|$|Because {{of damage}} to the wooden {{structure}} or mould on the suspended ceiling, examinations were made in three ice sports arenas in Northern Germany. Measurements of temperature and relative humidity inside and outside these arenas gave interesting results: During relatively warm winter periods the measured surface temperature {{at the bottom of}} the roof above the ice rink was lower than the air temperature in the arena, resulting in a significantly higher relative humidity at the roof than outside the building. Thus, condensed water was dripping from the roof construction to the ice. Depending on the construction, at the end of the winter the moisture content of the wooden structure was very high, partially resulting in wood destroying fungi, or the steel parts were corroding, respectively. In this paper the climatic conditions in ice sports arenas are simulated including conductivity, convection and radiation in a simplified model. The results were discussed for different parameters. Finally two different solu-tions are shown to lower the moisture content in the timber construction or the steel corrosion, respectively: • An <b>insulated</b> <b>suspended</b> ceiling below the roof construction may protect timber or steel from the low ice temperature with the resulting high humidity. • If the arena is closed to the outside air, an air-conditioning system may dry the air in the arena. By that means the relative humidity can descend as low as necessary for a durable construction. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{behaviour}} of an <b>insulating</b> particle <b>suspended</b> in {{a liquid}} metal {{and subject to}} the influence of locally uniform electric and magnetic fields (E,B) is considered. The electric field drives a current J which is perturbed by the presence of the particle, and the resulting Lorentz force drives a flow. It is assumed that both the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number based on particle size are small. If the particle is fixed, it experiences a force and couple that are each bilinear in J and B; if it is freely suspended, then it moves with translational velocity U and angular velocity O each similarly bilinear in J and B. The general form of these bilinear relationships is determined, with particular attention to three types of particle symmetry: (i) isotropy; (ii) axisymmetry; and (iii) orthotropy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{contactless}} {{technique is}} presented {{for the detection}} of micron-sized insulating particles in the flow of an electrically conducting fluid. A transverse magnetic field brakes this flow and tends to become entrained in the flow direction by a Lorentz force, whose reaction force on the magnetic-field-generating system can be measured. The presence of <b>insulating</b> particles <b>suspended</b> in the fluid produce changes in this Lorentz force, generating pulses in it; these pulses enable the particles to be counted and sized. A two-dimensional numerical model that employs a moving mesh method demonstrates the measurement principle when such a particle is present. Two prototypes and a three-dimensional numerical model are used to demonstrate the feasibility of a Lorentz force particle analyzer (LFPA). The findings of this study conclude that such an LFPA, which offers contactless and on-line quantitative measurements, can be applied to an extensive range of applications. These applications include measurements of the cleanliness of high-temperature and aggressive molten metal, such as aluminum and steel alloys, and the clean manufacturing of semiconductors.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{numerical}} simulation {{is carried out}} to determine the stress distribution on railhead {{in the vicinity of}} an <b>insulated</b> rail joint <b>suspended</b> between sleepers. The dynamic wheel load due to rail end discontinuity is considered in the simulation. The dynamic loads are treated as Hertzian pressure modified for plasticity of the railhead and discontinuity of the rail section near endpost. Submodelling is considered in this simulation to present stress distribution on the railhead. Von Mises stresses in loading and unloading (residual), vertical stresses and equivalent plastic strains are presented. Shakedown theorem is considered to apply a peak pressure load on the rail which is below the shakedown limit. As a result, a non-progressive damage of the railhead material is anticipated. Residual longitudinal stress is critical for damage of the railhead top surface and von-Mises along with vertical stresses is significant for subsurface damage of the railhead in the vicinity of rail joint...|$|R
40|$|Pristine bilayer {{graphene}} behaves in {{some instances}} as an insulator with a transport gap of a few meV. This behaviour has been interpreted {{as the result of}} an intrinsic electronic instability induced by many-body correlations. Intriguingly, however, some samples of similar mobility exhibit good metallic properties, with a minimal conductivity of the order of $ 2 e^ 2 /h$. Here we propose an explanation for this dichotomy, which is unrelated to electron interactions and based instead on the reversible formation of boundaries between stacking domains (`solitons'). We argue, using a numerical analysis, that the hallmark features of the previously inferred many-body insulating state can be explained by scattering on boundaries between domains with different stacking order (AB and BA). We furthermore present experimental evidence, reinforcing our interpretation, of reversible switching between a metallic and an <b>insulating</b> regime in <b>suspended</b> bilayers when subjected to thermal cycling or high current annealing.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} Monte Carlo method of {{simulating}} lattice field theories {{as a means}} of studying the low-energy effective theory of graphene. We also report on simulational results obtained using the Metropolis and Hybrid Monte Carlo methods for the chiral condensate, which is the order parameter for the semimetal-insulator transition in graphene, induced by the Coulomb interaction between the massless electronic quasiparticles. The critical coupling and the associated exponents of this transition are determined by means of the logarithmic derivative of the chiral condensate and an equation-of-state analysis. A thorough discussion of finite-size effects is given, along with several tests of our calculational framework. These results strengthen the case for an <b>insulating</b> phase in <b>suspended</b> graphene, and indicate that the semimetal-insulator transition is likely to be of second order, though exhibiting neither classical critical exponents, nor the predicted phenomenon of Miransky scaling.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work on}} the research project on this cooperative program between DOE and Hitachi, Ltd. Major advances were made in the computational reconstruction of images from electrical excitation and response data with respect to existing capabilities reported in the literature. A demonstration is provided of the imaging of one or more circular objects within the measurement plane with demonstrated linear resolution of six parts in two hundred. At this point {{it can be said that}} accurate excitation and measurement of boundary voltages and currents appears adequate to obtain reasonable images of the real conductivity distribution within a body and the outlines of <b>insulating</b> targets <b>suspended</b> within a homogeneous conducting medium. The quality of images is heavily dependent on the theoretical and numerical implementation of imaging algorithms. The overall imaging system described has the potential of being both fast and cost effective in comparison with alternative methods. The methods developed use multiple plate-electrode excitation in conjunction with finite element block decomposition, preconditioned voltage conversion, layer approximation of the third dimension and post processing of boundary measurements to obtain optimal boundary excitations. Reasonably accurate imaging of single and multiple targets of differing size, location and separation is demonstrated and the resulting images are better than any others found in the literature. Recommendations for future effort include the improvement in computational algorithms with emphasis on internal conductivity shape functions and the use of adaptive development of quadrilateral (2 -D) or tetrahedral or hexahedral (3 -D) elements to coincide with large discrete zone boundaries in the fields, development of a truly binary model and completion of a fast imaging system. Further, the rudimentary methods shown herein for three-dimensional imaging need improving...|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} {{mesoscopic}} electronic systems has been explored {{for more than}} 15 years. Mesoscopic phenomena in transport processes occur when the wavelength or the coherence length of the carriers becomes comparable to, or larger than, the sample dimensions. One striking result in this domain is the quantization of electrical conduction, observed in a quasi-one-dimensional constriction formed between reservoirs of two-dimensional electron gas. The conductance of this system {{is determined by the}} number of participating quantum states or 'channels' within the constriction; in the ideal case, each spin-degenerate channel contributes a quantized unit of 2 e^ 2 /h to the electrical conductance. It has been speculated that similar behaviour should be observable for thermal transport in mesoscopic phonon systems. But experiments attempted in this regime have so far yielded inconclusive results. Here we report the observation of a quantized limiting value for the thermal conductance, G_(th), in <b>suspended</b> <b>insulating</b> nanostructures at very low temperatures. The behaviour we observe is consistent with predictions for phonon transport in a ballistic, one-dimensional channel: at low temperatures, G_(th) approaches a maximum value of g_ 0 = π^ 2 k^ 2 BT/ 3 h, the universal quantum of thermal conductance...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{design of}} a silicon-based micro-reformer for onboard {{hydrogen}} generation from ethanol is presented in this work. The micro-reactor is fully fabricated with mainstream MEMS technology and consists of an active low-thermal-mass structure <b>suspended</b> by an <b>insulating</b> membrane. The <b>suspended</b> structure includes an embedded resistive metal heater {{and an array of}} ca. 20 k vertically aligned through-silicon micro-channels per square centimetre. Each micro-channel is 500 mu m in length and 50 mu m in diameter allowing a unique micro-reformer configuration that presents a total surface per projected area of 16 cm(2) cm(- 2) and per volume of 320 cm(2) cm(- 3). The walls of the micro-channels become the active surface of the micro-reformer when coated with a homogenous thin film of Rh-Pd/CeO 2 catalyst. The steam reforming of ethanol under controlled temperature conditions (using the embedded heater) and using the micro-reformer as a standalone device are evaluated. Fuel conversion rates above 94 % and hydrogen selectivity values of ca. 70 % were obtained when using operation conditions suitable for application in micro-solid oxide fuel cells (micro-SOFCs), i. e. 750 degrees C and fuel flows of 0. 02 ml(L) min(- 1) (enough to feed a one watt power source).

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper aims to investigate alternative ways of reducing the deterioration and failure of railway track insulated rail joints (IRJs). Joints deteriorate faster than rail initially due to the structural discontinuity present. This weakness results in both extra displacement {{as a consequence of}} applied load and the dynamic force that results as a consequence. Over time this situation worsens as the impacts and applied stresses both damage and soften the ballast and supporting subgrade under the joint. This study initially presents a static finite element model designed to simulate the mechanics of IRJs and a comparison between plain rail and a <b>suspended</b> <b>insulated</b> rail joint under various support stiffnesses. Product design options of reinforced IRJs are then chosen as input variables of the model. Results of the model are compared with field and laboratory data acquired via the Video Gauge, which is a new high-resolution optical measurement technique. Results show that the use of strap rails or more robust I-beam sections {{in the vicinity of the}} IRJ to stiffen the support structure can significantly reduce the displacement and the subsequent dip angle seen at an IRJ. This potentially presents a means of improving the IRJ behaviour. Their impact becomes more significant for soft support conditions. Although these results are indicative for new IRJ conditions, field measurements indicate that the magnitude of deflection of IRJs is a result of the structural discontinuity of the rail, the dynamic P 2 force, the wheel condition, the degraded ballast and it significantly increases with time under repeated load. Thus, it is recommended that careful field implementation and testing will indicate the effect of an external enhancement on the timely degradation of insulated rail joints...|$|R
