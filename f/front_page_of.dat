5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow.

The research involved a detailed analysis <b>of</b> 2, 448 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the five main Basque newspapers, with a total of 19, 156 news items. A specific methodology was developed for this work, enabling both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the news stories to be made.

5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off {{and went on to}} chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|For {{her actions}} {{in the battle for}} the village of Kozyi Gory (Smolensk Oblast), Shanina was awarded her first {{military}} decoration, the Order of Glory 3rd Class on 17 April 1944. She became the first Soviet female sniper and the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order. According to the report of Major Degtyarev (the commander of the 1138th Rifle Regiment), she received the award for the corresponding commendation list, between 6 and 11 April Shanina killed 13 enemy soldiers while subjected to artillery and machine gun fire. By May 1944, her sniper tally increased to 17 confirmed enemy kills, and Shanina was praised as a precise and brave soldier. The same year, on 9 June, Shanina's portrait was featured on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet newspaper Unichtozhim Vraga.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At {{the peak of the}} comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and {{is believed to be the}} last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently {{was the result of the}} discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|Castro became {{critical}} of the corruption and violence of Grau's regime, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him {{a place on the}} <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> several newspapers. In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular – PSP), the Socialist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR) and the Insurrectional Revolutionary Union (Unión Insurrecional Revolucionaria – UIR) – he grew close to the UIR, although biographers are unsure whether he became a member. In 1947, Castro joined a new socialist group, the Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás (1907–1951). A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang-related assassinations during this period, including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez, MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez, but these charges remain unproven.|$|E
