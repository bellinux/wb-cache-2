If the fielding team reaches second base before the batter reaches first base, the <b>invisible</b> runner is out. Otherwise, the <b>invisible</b> runner is considered safe. Similarly, an <b>invisible</b> runner advances only as many bases as the actual runner. For example, if an <b>invisible</b> runner is on second base and the batter hits a single to the outfield, the <b>invisible</b> runner only proceeds to third, even though a physical runner would often score in a similar scenario.|$|R

500|$|Central to {{this story}} are Les <b>Invisibles</b> (The Invisible Ones), a group of seven beings worshipped by the natives of Mexico and Haiti prior {{to the arrival of}} Spanish colonists in the 16th century, {{identified}} by some fans as the Loa of the Voodoo religion. The nature of Les <b>Invisibles</b> is left unclear, though it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials, or beings akin to the Great Old Ones in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. An interpretation of the lyrics of the song [...] "Astronomy" [...] by some fans suggests that the star Sirius is of particular astrological significance to Les <b>Invisibles,</b> with clues identifying it as their place of origin; it is during the so-called Dog Days of August, when Sirius is in conjunction with the Sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex. By subtly influencing the minds of men, the beings are said to be [...] "playing with our history as if it's a game", affecting events in world history over the course of centuries. For the three centuries after European discovery of the New World, this game plays out as the desire for gold is used to transform Spain into the dominant power in Europe, only to be usurped by England in the 17th century and later, through technology, by other nations ("Les Invisibles").|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{story begins}} in August 1804, {{with the birth}} of a [...] "modified child" [...] called Imaginos, in the American state of New Hampshire. Because of the astrological significance of the place and time of his birth, Imaginos is of particular interest to Les <b>Invisibles,</b> who begin investing him with superhuman abilities while he is young. Unaware of his true destiny or nature, the young Imaginos finds out that he is apparently able to change his appearance at will and to see the future ("Imaginos"). As the child becomes an adult he finds himself affected by wanderlust and, billing himself as an adventurer, sets out to explore Texas and the western frontier, arriving in New Orleans in 1829. It is there that he has a vision imploring him to travel to Mexico in search of an artifact [...] "lost, last and luminous, scored to sky yet never found". Imaginos joins the crew of a ship traveling to the Yucatán Peninsula, but while passing through the Gulf of Mexico, the ship encounters a freak storm of which his visions failed to warn him ("Del Rio's Song"). The ship sinks with most of its crew, and Imaginos, half dead, washes ashore and is left for dead by the other survivors. As he lies dying [...] "on a shore where oyster beds seem plush as down", Imaginos is addressed by a symphony of voices who identify themselves as Les <b>Invisibles.</b> Imaginos' true nature is revealed to him, and he is informed that the circumstances of his entire life have been manipulated to bring him to that specific moment in time. Having explained themselves to him, they offer him a choice – die as a human, or live as their servant ("Blue Öyster Cult"). Imaginos accepts their offer, and is resurrected from the dead by the Blue Öyster Cult, the servants of Les <b>Invisibles.</b> He is inducted into the cult and given a new name - Desdinova, [...] "Eternal Light". He realizes that his descent and the origin of his powers comes from the stars where his masters live and becomes aware of his role in the making of history ("Astronomy").|$|E

[...] Over the Christmas and New Year period of 2007 and 2008, Mantle portrayed the villain Abanazer in a pantomime production of Aladdin at the Theatre Royal in Bath, described as an attempt by a theatre spokesman for Mantle to [...] "throw off his gentle giant persona and transform himself into a classic panto baddie for the audience to boo and hiss wildly."

2500|$|Bolland's covers {{adorn the}} whole {{second and third}} volumes of Grant Morrison's The <b>Invisibles</b> and his depictions of the main {{characters}} are widely reprinted as the definitive images, despite them all having been realised by other artists – and often drawn by several before Bolland entered the picture. With this title, the artist remarks [...] "the subject matter is more complicated," [...] necessitating his [...] "working a lot of strange symbolism and subliminal messages into the cover designs" [...] to create [...] "an image that puzzles to a degree and is layered with elements of surrealism." [...] Asked to take over from Sean Hughes and [...] "do the covers on volume two" [...] by editor Shelly Roeberg, Bolland found her to be [...] "the dream editor," [...] effusive with praise and [...] "very specific about what she required." [...] Generally, Bolland recalls [...] "she was enthusiastic about my ideas," [...] although Morrison had [...] "creator's approval" [...] on all designs. Finding {{that he had a}} rapport with, and the trust of, his editor, Bolland thinks that these factors [...] "resulted in some of [...] most experimental work." [...] Newly embracing the use of a computer, Bolland cites The <b>Invisibles</b> Vol 2 No. 11 as his earliest computer-assisted piece of artwork, using it to [...] "insert... a computer generated background behind a severed hand." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>invisible</b> support on {{recipients}} have been extensively investigated, but {{the consequences of}} <b>invisible</b> support on providers are less known. One study in 2016 investigated the benefits and costs of <b>invisible</b> support on couple-members who enacted supportive behaviors by differentiating the processes of <b>invisible</b> emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) from processes of <b>invisible</b> instrumental support (providing tangible aid such as sending money or childcare). No costs of support-giving were found for providers when they demonstrated acts of <b>invisible</b> emotional support. The effects for <b>invisible</b> instrumental support told a different story, where providers who reported high relationship satisfaction were unaffected, but providers who reported low relationship satisfaction were negatively affected by their acts of <b>invisible</b> instrumental support {{with an increase in}} negative mood. These findings suggest that emotional comfort may be a more central function to maintain close relationships than instrumental support. Therefore, providing <b>invisible</b> emotional support may lead to less perceptions of a costly inequity than providing <b>invisible</b> instrumental support on average. However, since <b>invisible</b> instrumental support did not incur costs for providers who reported high relationship satisfaction, it implies that high relationship satisfaction may buffer potential costs that would otherwise be felt by support-providers. The differential results between <b>invisible</b> instrumental and emotional support indicate that a solid distinction between instrumental and emotional social support may be useful to take into account when investigating effects of <b>invisible</b> support as a whole.|$|R

2500|$|The {{covers for}} the third volume of The <b>Invisibles</b> were [...] "done on the computer," [...] in part because [...] "Vertigo were paying for [...] "painted" [...] covers and [...] felt [...] had to deliver {{something}} more than line and flat color." [...] The experimental nature of the twelve covers was assisted by the fact that, says Bolland [...] "neither I nor Shelly had seen that issue's script." [...] For the trade paperback covers, Bolland [...] "was determined to make each one weirder than the last," [...] and so created a Francis Bacon inspired [...] "fleshy mass [...] with a typewriter" [...] for Entropy in the UK. Having convinced Karen Berger (Editor in chief of Vertigo) and Shelly Roeberg {{that it was a}} good idea, the artist recalls that [...] "Shelly rang up and, rather than telling me how wonderful I was, said that when she saw it she nearly lost her lunch! I was asked to turn his skin color from flesh to blue to tone him down a bit." [...] For the final Invisible Kingdom TPB cover, Bolland produced [...] "a cover containing 12 small alternative <b>Invisibles</b> covers," [...] which [...] "took a long time to do." [...] Likening the process to creating [...] "a mini comic strip," [...] Bolland says that [...] "if any detail made any sense it had to be changed to something that didn't." ...|$|E
