40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{solutions and}} studies {{related to the}} design of reconfigurable and wideband receiver circuits for system-on-chip (SoC) radiometer front-ends within the millimetre-wave (mm-wave) range. Whereas many of today’s mm-wave front-ends are bulky and costly due to having discrete RF components, single-chip receiver modules could potentially result in a wider use for emerging applications such as wireless communication, short range radar and passive imaging security sensors if realised with adequate performances and at a lower cost. Three main topics are considered in this thesis, monolithic integration of low-loss RF-MEMS (Dicke) switch networks and switched LNAs in MMIC/RFIC foundry processes, designs of SiGe wideband (IF) amplifier and broadband power detectors up to W-band (75 - 110 GHz). Low-loss and high isolation GaAs and SiGe RF-MEMS switch networks were designed and characterised for the 30 - 110 GHz range. A GaAs MEMS Dicke switch network has a measured minimum loss of 1 dB and maximum isolation of 19 dB at 70 - 96 GHz, respectively, making it a potential candidate in <b>Dicke</b> switched <b>radiometer</b> receivers. Furthermore, single-chip 30 GHz and W-band MEMS Dicke switched LNA designs have been realised {{for the first time in}} SiGe BiCMOS and GaAs mHEMT processes, respectively. For a targeted 94 GHz passive imaging application two different receiver topologies have been investigated based on direct-detection and direct-conversion (heterodyne) architectures. An optimised detector design fabricated in a 0. 13  μm SiGe process achieves a more wideband input matching than earlier silicon W-band detectors and is competitive with reported III-V W-band detectors in terms of a higher responsivity and similar NEP. A SiGe 2 - 37 GHz high-gain differential (IF) amplifier design achieves a more wideband matching and an order of magnitude higher linearity than a recent single-ended SiGe LNA. The SiGe IF amplifier was integrated on-chip with a power detector in a 5 - 35 GHz IF section. Their broadband properties compared with other IF amplifier/detector RFICs, make them suitable for W-band down-conversion receivers with a larger pre-detection bandwidth and improved sensitivity. The experimental results successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the SiGe 5 - 35 GHz IF section for high performance SoC W-band radiometers using a more wideband heterodyne receiver architecture. ...|$|R

For this topology, a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) microwave switch is needed, which must have low insertion loss at the radiometer channel frequencies to minimize the overall receiver noise figure. Total power radiometers are limited in accuracy due to the continuous variation in gain of the receiver.

The market of RF systems has long evolved under a paradigm where once a system is built, performance cannot be changed.
