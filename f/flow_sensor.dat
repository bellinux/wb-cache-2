Attention is paid especially to performance and geometry of the sensors. Three basic types of thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> are discussed: anemometers, calorimetric <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> and time of flight <b>flow</b> <b>sensors.</b> Anemometers may comprise several heaters and temperature sensors and from a geometric point of view are similar sometimes for calorimetric <b>flow</b> <b>sensors.</b> We find that depending on the Reynolds number to or three element anemometers may perform as calorimetric sensors (very small Re) while calorimetric <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> operate like anemometers in the high Re regim...|$|R

5000|$|Harvesting on slopes {{decreases}} {{the accuracy of}} the mass flow sensing system in most cases. Due to different variations in impact plate placement by different manufacturers, the change in response from pitch and roll angles may differ slightly. In cases which the impact plate is located similar to that seen in the [...] "Impact based mass <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and clean grain elevator" [...] image, if the machine is pitched forward the mass flow will increase as gravity will aid in applying additional force to the mass <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> When the harvester is pitched aft, the sensor response is reduced as gravity reduces the amount of force applied to the mass <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> Roll causes similar error but of a smaller magnitude to that of the pitch of the harvester.|$|E
40|$|Flow sensing in hostile environments is of {{increasing}} interest for {{applications in the}} automotive, aerospace, and chemical and resource industries. There are thermal and non-thermal approaches for high-temperature flow measurement. Compared to their non-thermal counterparts, thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> have recently attracted {{a great deal of}} interest due to the ease of fabrication, lack of moving parts and higher sensitivity. In recent years, various thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> have been developed to operate at temperatures above 500 Â°C. Microelectronic technologies such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI), and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) have been used to make thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors.</b> Thermal sensors with various heating and sensing materials such as metals, semiconductors, polymers and ceramics can be selected according to the targeted working temperature. The performance of these thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> is evaluated based on parameters such as thermal response time, flow sensitivity. The data from thermal <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> reviewed in this paper indicate that the sensing principle is suitable for the operation under harsh environments.

50|$|An optical <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{a vision}} sensor capable of {{measuring}} optical flow or visual motion and outputting a measurement based on optical flow. Various configurations of optical flow sensors exist. One configuration {{is an image}} sensor chip connected to a processor programmed to run an optical flow algorithm. Another configuration uses a vision chip, which is an integrated circuit having both the image sensor and the processor on the same die, allowing for a compact implementation. An {{example of this is}} a generic optical mouse sensor used in an optical mouse. In some cases the processing circuitry may be implemented using analog or mixed-signal circuits to enable fast optical flow computation using minimal current consumption. One area of contemporary research is the use of neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement circuits that respond to optical flow, and thus may be appropriate for use in an optical <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> Such circuits may draw inspiration from biological neural circuitry that similarly responds to optical flow.|$|E

40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} manikins {{are used}} for training personnel in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. State-of-the-art cardiopulmonary resuscitation manikins are still anatomically and physiologically low-fidelity designs. The aim {{of this research was}} to design a manikin that offers high anatomical and physiological fidelity and has a cardiac and respiratory system along with integrated <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> to monitor cardiac output and air displacement in response to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This manikin was designed in accordance with anatomical dimensions using a polyoxymethylene rib cage connected to a vertebral column from an anatomical female model. The respiratory system was composed of silicon-coated memory foam mimicking lungs, a polyvinylchloride bronchus and a latex trachea. The cardiovascular system was composed of two sets of latex tubing representing the pulmonary and aortic arteries which were connected to latex balloons mimicking the ventricles and lumped abdominal volumes, respectively. These balloons were filled with Life/form simulation blood and placed inside polyether foam. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems were equipped with <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> to gather data in response to chest compressions. Three non-medical professionals performed chest compressions on this manikin yielding data corresponding to forceâdisplacement while the <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> provided feedback. The forceâdisplacement tests on this manikin show a desirable nonlinear behaviour mimicking chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans. In addition, the <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> provide valuable data on the internal effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
