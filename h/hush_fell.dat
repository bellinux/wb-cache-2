60|$|A sudden <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} company, and all faces were turned towards the visitors.|$|E
60|$|But {{those that}} knew, {{and they were}} many, ceased abruptly, and a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the room.|$|E
60|$|A <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> on the throng. From {{either end}} of the arena a mounted knight in armour had entered.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hush</b> that <b>fell</b> {{over the}} schoolroom {{was broken by}} the gong in the main hall, {{sounding}} throughout the building. Then followed the noise of shutting books and closing desks, and the bustle and shuffling of anticipated dismissal.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{minstrel}} {{sat in his}} lonely room, [...] Its {{walls were}} bare, and the twilight grey [...] Fell and crept and gathered to gloom; [...] It came like the ghost of the dying day, [...] And the chords <b>fell</b> <b>hushed</b> and low. [...] Pianissimo! ...|$|R
60|$|A great gate swung open, and a {{crowd of}} {{citizens}} poured in. They flocked around the two women, and hid them from the King's view. A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden. The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and answered, {{but he could not}} make out what was said. Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep <b>hush</b> gradually <b>fell</b> upon the people.|$|R
60|$|And as if a bird {{of the air}} {{had carried}} her voice, it seemed a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> on sky and greenery.|$|E
60|$|As Helen stepped {{slowly back}} a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the crowd. The whispering, the nervous coughing, and {{shuffling}} of feet, ceased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wetzel!" [...] exclaimed Colonel Zane. A <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> on {{the little}} company after that exclamation, and all eyes were {{fastened}} on the new comer.|$|E
5000|$|Hanna {{placed the}} noose around Bethea's neck, {{adjusted}} it, and then signaled to Hash {{to pull the}} trigger. Instead, Hash, who was drunk, did nothing. Hanna shouted at Hash, [...] "Do it!" [...] and a deputy leaned onto the trigger which sprang the trap door. Throughout all of this, the crowd was <b>hushed.</b> Bethea <b>fell</b> eight feet and his neck was instantly broken. About 14 minutes later, two doctors confirmed Bethea was dead. After the noose was removed, his body was taken to Andrew & Wheatley Funeral Home. He had wanted his body sent to his sister in South Carolina. Instead, he was buried in a pauper's grave at the Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery in Owensboro.|$|R
50|$|The {{remnants}} of hush gullies are visible at many {{places in the}} Pennines and at other locations such as the extensive lead mines at Cwmystwyth in Ceredigion, Wales, and at the Stiperstones in Shropshire. Another notable example is the Great Dun <b>Fell</b> <b>hush</b> gully near Cross Fell, Cumbria, probably formed in Georgian era {{in the search for}} lead and silver. This gully is about 100 feet deep, carries a small stream, and is a prominent landmark on the bleak moors. The dams used to store the water are also often visible {{at the head of the}} stream.|$|R
60|$|For a {{time the}} silence of the desert was broken by the {{laughter}} and talk of the men, but as the time went on the sounds were <b>hushed</b> as sleepiness <b>fell</b> upon them. Short halts were of frequent occurrence, as the baggage animals in the rear lagged behind, or their loads slipped, and had to be readjusted. Then a trumpet was sounded by the rear-guard, and it was repeated by the trumpeters along the column, and all came to a halt until the trumpet in the rear told that the camels there were ready to advance again. So the march continued throughout the whole night.|$|R
60|$|A {{few feet}} from the {{children}} Cole stopped. They were all intent and absorbed by the box on Steven's knees. Suddenly a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> over the children. Earl looked up slowly.|$|E
6000|$|The girl spoke so earnestly {{that for}} a moment a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the little group; and the Duc de Carolan, who clearly resented the warm tone in which she spoke, said: ...|$|E
60|$|As the King of France {{entered the}} {{antechamber}} a dead <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon all there, and Rupert Holliday looked eagerly {{to see what}} sort of man was the greatest sovereign in Europe.|$|E
6000|$|Then a great <b>hush</b> {{of silence}} <b>fell</b> over all and every voice was stilled, {{and at that}} hush of silence Sir Lavaine lifted the hood from his face and looked up from where {{he sat in the}} boat {{at the feet of the}} dead lady, and so beheld Sir Launcelot where he stood. Then upon the instant Sir Lavaine stood up in the barge and he cried out in a great loud harsh voice: [...] "Hah! art thou there, thou traitor knight? Behold the work that thou hast done; for this that thou beholdest is thy handiwork. Thou hast betrayed this lady's love for the love of another, and so thou hast brought her to her death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|While upon all, convicts {{and armed}} keepers ere they stirr'd, [...] (Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,) [...] A <b>hush</b> and pause <b>fell</b> down a wondrous minute, [...] With deep half-stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow'd {{and moved to}} weeping, [...] And youth's convulsive breathings, {{memories}} of home, [...] The mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy childhood, [...] The long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence; [...] A wondrous minute then--but after in the solitary night, to many, [...] many there, [...] Years after, even in the hour of death, the sad refrain, the tune, [...] the voice, the words, [...] Resumed, the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle, [...] The wailing melody again, the singer in the prison sings, ...|$|R
60|$|Now a <b>hush</b> of {{expectancy}} <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} crowd, till presently two attendants appeared, {{each of them}} holding in his hand a flaming torch, and between them the captive Pearl-Maiden. So beautiful did she look as she advanced thus with bowed head, the red light of the torches falling upon her white robe and breast and reflected in a faint, shimmering line from the collar of pearls about her neck, that even that jaded company clapped as she came. In another moment she had mounted the two steps and {{was standing on the}} block of marble. The crowd pressed closer, among them the merchant of Egypt, Demetrius, and the veiled woman with the basket, who was now attended by a little man dressed as a slave and bearing on his back another basket, the weight of which he seemed to find irksome, since from time to time he groaned and twisted his shoulders. Also the chamberlain, Saturius, secure in the authority of his master, stepped over the rope and against the rule began to walk round and round the captive, examining her critically.|$|R
60|$|A mighty <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> at {{once upon}} the people. The King of Fire and the King of Water stood back, obedient to his nod. They {{waited for the}} upshot of this strange new development.|$|E
6000|$|A <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> {{over the}} dinner-table, and every ear {{was open and}} {{inclined}} as Cameron, the host, continued: [...] "No, I wouldn't say that. There {{are some things that}} are pretty well established--telepathy, for instance." ...|$|E
6000|$|A solemn <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} great court--a silence so {{profound}} that men could hear their own hearts beat. Then the princess slowly turned, with eyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at Conrad, said: ...|$|E
40|$|Beijing, China. Tuesday, September 5, 1995. Beijing International Conference Center (BICC). The {{afternoon}} plenary of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women: Equality, Peace, Development {{is about}} to start in a hall too small to seat everyone {{who wants to be}} there. Other than places for some of the delegates from each attending State, space is limited and in high demand. A lucky few lined up for hours to get a ticket; many ended up negotiating prime space {{in front of one of}} several TV screens strategically located throughout the building. A <b>hushed</b> silence <b>fell</b> in the hall and in the areas surrounding the TV screens. The introduction: Hillary Rodham Clinton, First Lady of the United States of America. She speaks on women, children, poverty, education, health, and economic and political participation. She gets into a rhythm as she softly makes her point: 2 ̆ 2 If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, it is that human rights are women 2 ̆ 7 s rights-And women 2 ̆ 7 s rights are human rights. 2 ̆ 2 Emphasizing her message, she gives detailed examples [...] 2 ̆ 2 it is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls. 2 ̆ 2 She continues - 2 ̆ 2 it is a violation of human rights 2 ̆ 2 when women and girls are subject to: violence, even in their own homes; female genital mutilation; bride-burning; girl-killing; rape, sometimes as a tactic or prize of war; forced abortion; forced sterilization and the usual litany of abuses that are, regrettably, all too common and all too well known. The silence is broken, first by nervous and gradually empowered applause which fills the building-inside and outside the hall...|$|R
6000|$|The {{crowd was}} most dense and most noisy {{in front of}} the class-room in which the {{counting}} of the votes was going forward. At one the result was to be announced, and as the long hand of the great clock crept towards the hour, a <b>hush</b> of expectation <b>fell</b> upon the assembly. The brazen clang broke harshly out, and at the same moment the folding doors were flung open, and a knot of men rushed out into the crowd, who swirled and eddied round them. The centre of the throng was violently agitated, and the whole mass of people swayed outwards and inwards. For a minute or two the excited combatants seethed and struggled without a clue as to the cause of the commotion. Then the corner of a large placard was elevated above the heads of the rioters, on which was visible the word [...] "Liberal" [...] in great letters, but before it could be raised further it was torn down, and the struggle became fiercer than ever. Up came the placard again--the other corner this time--with the word [...] "Majority" [...] upon it, and then immediately vanished as before. Enough had been seen, however, to show which way the victory had gone, and shouts of triumph arose everywhere, with waving of hats and clatter of sticks. Meanwhile, in the centre the two parties fought round the placard, and the commotion began to cover a wider area, as either side was reinforced by fresh supporters. One gigantic Liberal seized the board, and held it aloft for a moment, so that it could be seen in its entirety by the whole multitude: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{proposition}} {{seemed to}} please Seth; he even {{extended his hand}} in the darkness. But he met only an irresponsive void. With a slight shrug of his shoulders and a grunting farewell, he felt his way to the door and disappeared. For a few moments it seemed as if Uncle Ben had also deserted the schoolhouse, so profound and quiet was the <b>hush</b> that <b>fell</b> upon it. But as the eye became accustomed to the shadow a grayish bulk appeared to grow out of it over the master's desk and shaped itself into the broad figure of Uncle Ben. Later, when the moon rose and looked in at the window, it saw him as the master had seen him on the first day he had begun his lessons in the school-house, with his face bent forward over the desk and the same look of child-like perplexity and struggle that he had worn at his allotted task. Unheroic, ridiculous, and no doubt blundering and idiotic as then, but still vaguely persistent in his thought, he remained for some moments in this attitude. Then rising and taking advantage of the moonlight that flooded the desk, he set himself to mend the broken lock with a large mechanical clasp-knife he produced from his pocket, and the aid of his workmanlike thumb and finger. Presently he began to whistle softly, at first a little artificially and with relapses of reflective silence. The lock of the desk restored, he secured into position again that part of the door-lock which he had burst off in his entrance. This done, he closed the door gently and once more stepped out into the moonlit clearing. In replacing his knife in his pocket he took out the letters which he had not touched since they were handed to him in the darkness. His first glance at the handwriting caused him to stop. Then still staring at it, he began to move slowly and automatically backwards to the porch. When he reached it he sat down, unfolded the letter, and without attempting to read it, turned its pages over and over with the unfamiliarity of an illiterate man in search of the signature. This when found apparently plunged him again into motionless abstraction. Only once he changed his position to pull up the legs of his trousers, open his knees, and extend the distance between his feet, and then with the unfolded pages carefully laid in the moonlit space thus opened before him, regarded them with dubious speculation. At the end of ten minutes he rose with a sigh of physical and mental relaxation, refolded the letter, put it in his pocket, and {{made his way to the}} town.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{procession}} paused, and a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the vast assembly. Then {{the silence was}} broken by the rustle and stir of all those thousands going down upon their knees, as the cardinal-patriarch lifted his hands to bless them.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{a silence}} {{came to the}} river, [...] A <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> over the shore, And Bohs that were brave departed, [...] And Sniders squibbed no more; [...] For the Burmans said [...] That a kullah's head Must be paid for with heads five score.|$|E
6000|$|The Altrurian spoke very solemnly, and a reverent <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} assembly. It {{was broken by}} {{the voice of a}} woman wailing out: [...] "Oh, do you suppose, if we lived so, we should feel so, too? That I should know my little girl was living?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A sudden <b>hush</b> <b>fell.</b> There {{were no more}} {{cries of}} [...] "Duca!" [...] They stood silent, and not a doubt but that in the breasts of the {{majority}} surged a great relief. Even the militia ceased to advance. If the Duke was dead {{there was nothing left}} to do.|$|E
60|$|A {{shaft of}} light shot across the dim-lit sea and wrapped boat and man in a splendor of red and gold. Then a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the fisherfolk, and only was heard the moan of the {{off-shore}} wind and {{the cries of the}} gulls flying low in the air.|$|E
60|$|A dead <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> {{upon the}} whole assembly. Without a word {{the leader of}} the {{charcoal}} burners strode away into the forest, and returned in another minute with the two horses. Rupert and Hugh wrung the hands of the peasants to whom they owed their lives, and leapt into the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|The Squire {{stood with}} his {{knuckles}} on his desk, staring first at Hiram {{and then at the}} strange burden he had brought. A sudden <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon all, though the voices of those without sounded as loud and turbulent as ever. [...] "What is it, Hiram?" [...] said Squire Hall at last.|$|E
60|$|A waiter {{deposited}} {{a dish of}} Wiener Nierenbraten {{in front}} of Elaine. At the same moment a magic <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the three German ladies at the adjoining table, and the flicker of a great fear passed across their eyes. Then they burst forth again into tumultuous chatter. Courtenay had proved a reliable prophet.|$|E
60|$|Tell, calm again now, {{raised his}} bow {{and took a}} steady aim. Everybody craned forward, the front ranks in vain telling those behind {{that there was nothing}} to be gained by pushing. Gessler bent over his horse's neck and peered eagerly towards Walter. A great <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> on all as Tell {{released}} the string.|$|E
60|$|Fighting {{there would}} have been also, {{notwithstanding}} all that d'Aguilar could do to prevent it; but of a sudden the noise began to die away, and a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the place. Then between the uplifted weapons walked a short, richly clad man, who turned suddenly and faced the mob. It was King Henry himself.|$|E
60|$|When all was {{arranged}} {{the length of}} the swords was measured. Both had come provided with a pair of duelling rapiers, and as all four weapons were of excellent temper and of exactly even length, no difficulty was met with here. Then a deep <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the gathering as the seconds returned to their principals.|$|E
6000|$|Greatly cheered by the idea, I {{seized the}} hair-brushes {{and looking at}} myself in the glass began to use them. Suddenly a <b>hush</b> <b>fell</b> upon the noise outside, and I heard (the ports of my cabin were thrown open)--I heard a deep calm voice, not on board my ship, however, hailing resolutely in English, but with a strong foreign twang, [...] "Go ahead!" ...|$|E
