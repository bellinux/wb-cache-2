5000|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is a contentious issue in New Zealand. [...] no {{genetically modified food}} was grown in New Zealand, and no medicines containing live genetically modified organisms have been approved for use. However, medicines manufactured using genetically modified organisms that do not contain live organisms have been approved for sale, and imported foods with genetically modified components are sold. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) must approve any food produced from GM crops, or made using <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>enzymes,</b> {{before it can be}} marketed in Australia or New Zealand. FSANZ makes a list of such approvals available on its website.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES The use of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>enzymes</b> in the {{synthesis}} of flavourings, fragrances and other applications has increased tremendously. There is, however, a paucity of data on sensitisation and/or allergy to the finished products. We aimed to review the use of genetically modified enzymes and the enormous challenges in human biomonitoring studies with suitable assays of specific IgE {{to a variety of}} modified enzyme proteins in occupational settings and measure specific IgE to modified enzymes in exposed workers. METHODS Specific IgE antibodies against workplace-specific individual enzymes were measured by the specific fluorescence enzyme-labelled immunoassay in 813 exposed workers seen in cross-sectional surveys. RESULTS Twenty-three per cent of all exposed workers showed type I sensitisation with IgE antibodies directed against respective workplace-specific enzymes. The highest sensitisation frequencies observed were for workers exposed enzymes derived from α-amylase (44...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi) plants {{expressing a}} <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> fused <b>enzyme</b> between rat {{cytochrome}} P 4501 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1) and yeast NADPH-cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase were produced. The expression plasmid pGFC 2 for the fused enzyme was constructed by insertion of the corresponding cDNA into the expression vector pNG 01 {{under the control}} of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and nopaline synthase gene terminator. The fused enzyme cDNA was integrated into tobacco genomes by Agrobacterium infection techniques. In transgenic tobacco plants, the fused enzyme protein was localized primarily in the microsomal fraction. The microsomal monooxygenase activities were approximately 10 times higher toward both 7 -ethoxycoumarin and benzo[a]pyrene than in the control plant. The transgenic plants also showed resistance to the herbicide chlortoluron...|$|R
30|$|Nearly 30 % {{more people}} will occupy Earth in the year 2050, {{increasing}} the demand for day-to-day services. This is {{likely to result in}} ecosystem degradation, reduced bio-diversity and of course changing climate. One of the major concerns is to reduce use of chemical routes for synthesis of common products and shift towards enzyme based technologies. New strategies need to be developed as enzymatic methods provide an excellent eco-friendly alternative. Coupling the enzymatic routes to continuous product removal strategies (for instance, by use of special matrices that selectively bind products) can lead to efficient conversion efficiencies. While such systems can be operated at laboratory scale, a bioreactor for commercial scale production is in high demand. Thermophilic enzymes (or cell sources of these enzymes) could also be used in such conversions. Whole cell catalysis is a novel approach and requires an in-depth study. Development of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>enzymes</b> with increased organic solvent tolerance and selectivity towards nucleophile other than water would be desirable. Ionic liquids offer many advantages over conventional organic solvents because of their excellent physico chemical properties like thermal stability, near-zero vapour pressure, tunable properties like polarity/hydrophobicity/solvent miscibility. Some success has been reported with these in alkyl glucoside synthesis. These also allow use of a large range of compounds which can be solubilized by adjusting the cation/anion ratio. Another important feature of using ionic liquids is their ability to enhance in some cases enantio-, stereo-, and regio selectivity. Very little work has been reported using this solvent for β–glycosidases and needs to be investigated extensively.|$|R
40|$|Crops of {{the near}} future will be genome edited via a {{technology}} called “Genome editing with engineered nucleases ” or GEEN, a technology that can add, remove or repair existing genes that might be not desirable such as genes that make crops susceptible to diseases, insects, drought, heat, cold or other biotic and abiotic stress factors. For decades, molecular biologists have been using restriction nucleases or restriction enzymes to cut DNA at or near DNA specific recognition sites in order to study the crops DNAs or to <b>genetically</b> <b>engineer</b> crops. Restriction <b>enzymes</b> naturally exist in bacteria, evolutionally developed to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses by selectively cleaving the viral DNA while the host DNA is protected by the methylase enzymes that block such cleavage in the host DNA. The GEEN technology mostly uses artificially engineered restriction nucleases that {{have been designed to}} make specific cleavage called double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in specific recognition sites of...|$|R
40|$|The drug {{candidate}} DFP [5, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -(2 -isopropoxy) - 4 -(4 -meth-anesulfonylphenyl) - 2 (5 H) -furanone] is a selective cyclooxygen-ase- 2 inhibitor under evaluation for analgesic and anti-inflamma-tory therapy. The in vitro metabolic pathways (rat microsomes) involve hydroxylation of the isopropyl side chain at either of two positions, the methyl or the methine, thus producing a hydroxy-lated metabolite (DFHP) or a dealkylated metabolite (DFH). DFH formation {{was the major}} pathway. Using hepatic microsomes from rats treated with agents that induce specific CYP isozymes, it was shown that the dexamethasone-inducible rat CYP 3 A isozyme(s) {{play a major role}} in DFH formation. The roles of CYP 3 A 1 and- 3 A 2 were confirmed with <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> rat CYP <b>enzymes.</b> The potential for induction of rat CYP 3 A by DFP was evaluated by incubating DFP in rat hepatocyte cultures and measuring the CYP 3 A levels. Both CYP 3 A immunoreactive protein and enzym...|$|R

A pH assay showed <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> E coli cells accumulated Ni 2 + effectively over {{a broad range of}} pH (4 - 10).

40|$|In many countries, the {{patenting}} of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> {{animals is}} now largely uncontroversial. In this paper, I argue that assemblage theory offers an alternative analysis of patents and <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> animals. This emphasises heterogeneity and relations, and focuses {{attention on the}} processes of territorialisation (stabilisation) and deterritorialisation (destabilisation). More specifically, by conceptualising the <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> EnviroPig as an assemblage of heterogeneous actants I uncover some of relations between different actants such as pigs, manure, the environment, patents, industry and advocacy groups, regulatory frameworks and so on. I also situate patents within the EnviroPig-assemblage and show that while patents cannot, in themselves, make <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> animals live they do {{have the capacity to}} both stabilise and destabilise a <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> assemblage. In the end, though, patents (legally) are just one actant in an assemblage, and the case of the EnviroPig points out the contingent and situational nature of patented life forms, and the complexity and instability of the bricolages which are necessary to bring them into the world and maintain their existence. The story of the EnviroPig-assemblage shows a <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> life cut short by a mixture of actants including the complexities of regulatory frameworks, environmental and animal welfare concerns, and organised resistance from activists and anti-GM advocacy groups...|$|R
