40|$|Although {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} over recent years in the intergenerational transmission of Western <b>domestic</b> <b>property,</b> and specifically housing inheritance, the line of descent in this transmission has been ignored. We do not know whether <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> goes disproportionately to the next generations(s) of men, or to women, or equally to men and women as the Western cognatic system of descent would dictate. This paper explores the line of descent through an argument proffered by two European sociologists, Delphy and Leonard. They maintain that <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> goes disproportionately to the next generation(s) of men because of the power of patriarchy. However, neither available information, nor data from an Australian case study, confirms this claim. Indeed, there is a suggestion that <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> goes roughly equally to the next generations of men and women. The implications of these findings are explored...|$|R

40|$|Though its causes {{have been}} theorized, little is {{understood}} about why gentrification often transforms neighborhoods in radically different ways. This thesis links {{previous research on}} gentrification {{with the concept of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> interests in an effort to better understand the micro-level processes involved in the production of a gentrified landscape. Once identified as Tucson's skid row, Tucsonans now value Barrio Historico as a historic, Mexican-American neighborhood. Some residents argue that gentrification, though slow and incomplete, is destroying the neighborhood's sense of community and tradition. Interviews with twenty-two residents assessed their <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> interests and identified the ways in which residents either resist or encourage development. The analysis revealed how conflicts among residents with differing interests and ideological perspectives contribute to the production of the neighborhood landscape. Though not unproblematic, the analysis of residents' <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> interests complements previous macro-scale approaches by providing a contextually based understanding of neighborhood change...|$|R

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to the control of house mouse infestations rely heavily on a reactive service, where treatments are undertaken in response to complaints. The impact of buildings on the distribution and persistence of house mouse infestations has received little attention. This paper reports the results of 117 surveys of <b>domestic</b> <b>properties</b> in an urban area of Manchester. Results found that mice were not uniformly distributed within the <b>domestic</b> <b>properties</b> surveyed and that general characteristics and construction of the property, food hygiene within the kitchen area and overall fitness influenced distribution.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the costs of}} mitigating radon levels in <b>domestic</b> <b>properties</b> {{using data from the}} radon-affected county of Northamptonshire in the United Kingdom. Cost-effectiveness of mitigation is measured in terms of the total costs per lung cancers saved per year by mitigation expenditures. The results obtained match those reported in published theoretical estimates for proposed national mitigation programmes. Mitigation in <b>domestic</b> <b>properties</b> is shown to be more effective in reducing lung cancers than a mitigation programme designed for National Health Service workplaces in Northamptonshire, when all householders discovering radon levels above 300 Bequerels per cubic metre (Bq m− 3) are assumed to implement mitigation strategies. In the United Kingdom, however, as elsewhere, {{only a small percentage of}} those finding raised radon levels proceed to mitigation. This reduces the effectiveness of mitigation programmes in <b>domestic</b> <b>properties</b> to levels matching those in the National Health Service workplaces. The paper confirms findings in studies from Europe and the United States that a significant proportion of householders with radon levels between 200 and 300 Bq m− 3 do not implement remedial work. The paper concludes with a range of policy proposals based on the results obtained...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>property</b> {{is defined}} in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 as [...] "used wholly for the {{purposes}} of living accommodation", with provisos to exclude hotels and short stay accommodation and include moorings and caravans where appropriate. It states that unused <b>domestic</b> <b>property</b> is to be considered domestic if it appears that will be the next use. Any hereditament that does not meet the criteria for domestic will be non-domestic (although it may then be exempt). It is possible for a hereditament to be both non-domestic and domestic in different parts, for example a shop with living accommodation. This is known as a composite hereditament, and the whole property is entered in the rating list, but the non-domestic valuation is based on the non-domestic part only.|$|R

40|$|Presents a {{conceptual}} model for assessing flood damage to UK <b>domestic</b> <b>properties.</b> The model originates from {{a critique of}} existing knowledge {{in the field and}} from discussions held with practitioners responsible for surveying and recommending strategies for repair of such properties. Flood damage assessment is a complex task requiring consideration of many factors. Subsequently, the model takes into account building characteristics along with the characteristics of the flood. Presently, recommendations in the literature for repairing flood damaged properties are very general in nature so “convenient” and circumspect inferences tend to be made by surveyors. In turn, professional guidance in this respect exhibits substantial variance regarding, for example, their specific recommendations for repair work. Because of this variance, it is difficult to confirm whether any repair strategy implemented is optimal, in terms of, for example, cost expended or methods used. The model presented progresses knowledge towards standardising the assessment of flood damaged UK <b>domestic</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|R
