5000|$|A <b>Mortgage</b> Revenue <b>Bond</b> Loan or {{bond loan}} {{is a type}} of {{mortgage}} loan where the cost of borrowing is partially subsidized by a <b>mortgage</b> revenue <b>bond.</b> Although details differ between programs, <b>mortgage</b> revenue <b>bond</b> loan programs are in general designed to lower the cost of homeownership for low to medium income borrowers, sometimes for targeted occupations or neighborhoods.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} <b>mortgage</b> covered <b>bonds</b> {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute mortgage funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

40|$|The rapid {{mortgage}} credit growth experienced {{in recent years}} in mature and emerging countries has raised some stability concerns. Many European credit institutions in mature markets have reacted by increasing securitization, particularly via <b>mortgage</b> covered <b>bonds.</b> From the issuer''s perspective, these instruments have become an attractive funding source and a tool for assetliability management; from the investor''s perspective, covered bonds enjoy a favorable risk-return profile and a very liquid market. In this paper, we examine the two largest "jumbo" covered bond markets, Germany and Spain. We show how movements in covered bond prices can be used to analyze the credit developments of the underlying issuer and the quality of its mortgage portfolio. Our analysis also suggests that <b>mortgage</b> covered <b>bonds</b> could be of interest to other mature and emerging markets facing similar risks related to {{mortgage credit}}.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} mortgage securities {{as a source}} of financing credit activities in the mortgage market of the European Union. Although they basically provide the same products â€“ mortgages, credit institutions differ in the way of financing their activities. While some institutions finance their activities by deposits, others issue <b>mortgage</b> securities (<b>mortgage</b> <b>bonds</b> and mortgage-backed securities) through the capital market. This analysis based on relevant literature and appropriate statistical data showed that the importance of mortgage securities vary from country to country. At the level of the European Union its overall importance is very high, since more than Â¼ of all credit activities on the mortgage market are financed by these instruments. Moreover, it has been proved that <b>mortgage</b> <b>bonds</b> and <b>mortgage</b> backed securities in many ways satisfy various needs of creditors. The selection of the instrument depends on the creditor's and investor's requirements and it is determined by historical, legal and regulatory framework, {{as well as with the}} structure of the mortgage market in which the creditor operated. In many countries, <b>mortgage</b> <b>bonds</b> and <b>mortgage</b> backed securities are accepted as alternative and complementary source of finance, which results in the coexistence of these two types of mortgage securities. Historical data and recent trends suggest that, in the future, both of these instruments (especially <b>mortgage</b> <b>bonds)</b> will represent a significant source of financing credit activities in the mortgage market...|$|R
