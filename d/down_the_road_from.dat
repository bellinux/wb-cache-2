5|$|The JNA, {{warned about}} {{reinforcements}} to the 137th Infantry Brigade, abandoned {{its plan to}} advance to Barilović. It reoriented its efforts to reach the Korana Bridge {{in the village of}} Malići, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> Gornji Velemerić and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in the morning when JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade).|$|E
5|$|Neither {{dropped below}} 11th place overall {{heading into the}} stage 10 {{individual}} time trial, where the squad had three riders finish in the top ten. Cancellara's fourth-place ride was perhaps a disappointment, in that he finished a minute and 27 seconds slower than the stage winner Tony Martin, the rider seen as his chief rival for the world championships time trial. Fuglsang took sixth on the day and Monfort tenth, putting Fuglsang 12 seconds off the race lead in second place overall and Monfort sixth 59 seconds back. Both of them lost time in stage 11, finishing in a group 27 seconds back of the group containing most of the race's top riders, but both remained in the top ten overall. Both again fell down the standings in stage 14 on La Farrapona, a day when {{out of the first}} 50 riders no more than four finished together. Their overall positions reversed the next day on the storied Alto del Angliru. Monfort finished with a group that lost time to only six riders, while Fuglsang was a further minute and eight seconds <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> his teammate. This left Monfort fifth overall and Fuglsang seventh, after Fuglsang had been the higher-placed of the two for the entire race to that point. The next major mountain was Peña Cabarga in stage 17. Both riders were well off the pace, with Monfort finishing 19th and Fuglsang 31st. Monfort still held sixth overall with the result, but Fuglsang fell out of the top ten, down to 12th place. Fuglsang improved a place to 11th after stage 19, when Wouter Poels, who had been ahead of him, finished six minutes behind the main field. Those were their final overall positions, with both Monfort's sixth place and Fuglsang's 11th representing the best such finishes for either of them in a Grand Tour. The day before the race ended, Bennati gave the team a second stage win, coming home first in a large sprint finish in stage 20 at Vitoria.|$|E

Operations were handed over to the United States Army Air Corps on 10 April 1942 before they were transferred to a disused railway tunnel at St James railway station in Sydney. The unit was renamed, Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ) on 21 January 1945 and moved into a three-storey semi-underground purpose built operations and plotting facility at Bankstown, known as the Bankstown Bunker.|$|E

In 1876, The Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad took over the Lake Ontario Shore Railroad and extended track, connecting Ransomville with Lewiston to the West and Syracuse to the East. This was later incorporated into the New York Central Railroad. A year later, Gilbert Curtiss built the Excelsior Elevator across from the rail depot. The Curtiss' agricultural business would grow to include a poultry farm that was considered {{the largest in the}} nation by the early 20th century.|$|R
25|$|Much of the borough's present {{land was}} {{occupied}} by Angelica Farm which would be established as an almshouse, or poorhouse, in 1824. The alms house was replaced by Bern Township's Berks Heim in 1952. The buildings of the Governor Mifflin School District now occupy most of land that was once part of the almshouse. Today, the most notable visible remnant of the poorhouse is a stone wall that is within short walking distance <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> John Updike's old home. Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, {{is set in a}} fictional building based on Shillington's poorhouse. Angelica Farm was also the historical home of Thomas Mifflin, the first governor of Pennsylvania and 11th President of the Continental Congress.|$|E
25|$|Herbert was {{presented}} with the Prebendary of Leighton Bromswold in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1626, whilst {{he was still a}} don at Trinity College, Cambridge but not yet ordained. He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding, two miles <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> Leighton Bromswold, to found the remarkable community with which his name has ever since been associated. Herbert raised money (including the use of his own) to restore the neglected church building at Leighton.|$|E
25|$|Anyhow, {{a fierce}} story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American {{character}} with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) {{is only half}} Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.|$|E

25|$|St. Andrew trained about 41 {{scholastic}} novices and 5 brother novices each year, and was {{at first}} the only novitiate in the province. Later on, provincial novitiates existed in Yonkers (1917–1923), Shadowbrook (1923–26), Wernersville, Pennsylvania (1930–42), and Plattsburgh (1955–59). The Shadowbrook. Wernersville, and Plattsburgh locations later became part of provinces subdivided from St. Andrew's. The novitiate's tertianship maintained about 28 tertians per year; it remained there until 1939 when it moved to Auriesville, New York. In the early 1920s, the novitiate also housed some first-year philosophers. Priests active in the community also stayed at St. Andrew-on-Hudson. A month after the novitiate's opening, one of the residing priests began to host Mass each week at Hudson River State Hospital, which was located a short distance <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> St. Andrew. The psychiatric hospital had about 2,000 patients at the time, {{many of whom were}} Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The AIF faced {{their last}} county {{opposition}} on Friday, 29 August in another two-day match, though they won this one.

Only 363 runs in the entire game. The first day was impacted by rain and only 59 overs were bowled. The AIF were all out for 85 just before the scheduled close of play. They quickly dismissed Somerset for 70 in only 32 overs of the second morning. Seamer Charlie Winning and slow left armer Collins did all the bowling, Winning taking six for 30 and Collins four for 38. Collins followed up with 67* to give the Australians a useful lead of 159 going into {{the latter half of}} the last day. Somerset lasted only 28 overs as Collins wiped them out with a career-best eight for 31.|$|E
25|$|Scaramanga was {{severely}} wounded in a dogfight and lost consciousness {{before he took}} down his twelfth and final enemy aircraft on 10 July 1918. He regained consciousness and with his one good arm shot down the attacking Pfalz D.III {{that had been on}} their tail. He died that same day, soon after he and his pilot, Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, landed, about two weeks short of his twentieth birthday. Scaramanga was interred at Aire Communal Cemetery in Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave reference number is III. H. 25. He is also commemorated on the Crawley Down War Memorial in Crawley Down, Worth, Sussex. The monument is located at the junction of Vicarage Road and Sandy Lane, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>from</b> the Church of All Saints.
