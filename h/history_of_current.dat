The neural network method using back-propagation learning algorithm real is proposed. The experimental data collected from suspension test machine consist in time <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>current,</b> displacement, velocity and force measured both for constant and variable current. The model parameters are determined using a set of experimental measurements corresponding to different current constant values.
