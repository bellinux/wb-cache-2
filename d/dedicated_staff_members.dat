In order to align itself with the Council of Heads of Medical Schools - now the Medical Schools Council - the DEAC changed its name in 1993 to the Council of Deans of Dental Schools (CDDS). However, it was later decided in 2005 that it was necessary to change the name to Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools to reflect that not all members of the organisation were given the title ‘Dean’. 2008 saw a final name change to the Dental Schools Council to reflect the expertise at all levels within the dental schools, from not only the Heads and Deans but also other <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> including admissions tutors, administrators and students themselves.|$|E

We also contextualize priori-ties within the aging network by describing the historical and policy frameworks that gave rise to development of AAAs in the US through legislative mandates of the Older Americans Act. Findings of our study, based on responses to a web based survey by 112 directors indicate that, even while meeting their primary mission of assisting frail elders, AAA direc-tors seek innovation. They assign high priority to introduction of preventive services that can promote health and empowerment of elders.

Further, they expect a wide range of cross-cultural experience including learning local cultures and making friends. 　After the study tour, the majority of them expressed their satisfaction with the program and intention to recommend the program to their friends. Nevertheless, the language classes consisting solely with Japanese students became the source of their complaints. They prefer to study the language with a group of students from different origins so that the English language becomes the real lingua franca of the class.

In most cases, {{with the exception of}} fully <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> hired {{for the sole purpose of}} MOOC development, MOOC related tasks are assigned to staff that already performs other roles in the institution. This is the case, among others, for lecturers, learning designers, multimedia producers, and PhD students who have dedicated part of their professional time to this new form of online education delivery. This study aims to capture the reflection of such professionals in two European universities, around their involvement in MOOC production and implementation. A series of interviews, both individual and in group, have been conducted to determine how MOOCs have influenced their practice, and what their vision is with regards of the role of MOOCs within their institutions. A preliminary analysis of the results suggests that those engaged in the production of MOOCs see these courses as beneficial to the institution, and more support and incentives to this end would be desirable.

We examined the association between childhood abuse and early menarche among pregnant women in Lima, Peru. Methods: Multinomial logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for early menarche (11 years) in relation to any physical or sexual childhood abuse, physical abuse only, sexual abuse only, and both physical and sexual abuse in a cohort of 1, 499 pregnant (first trimester) women. Results: Approximately 69 % of participants reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse in childhood. The frequencies of physical abuse only, sexual abuse only, and both physical and sexual abuse were 37. 4 %, 7. 7 %, and 24. 5 %, respectively. Compared with women who reported no childhood abuse, those who reported any childhood abuse had a 1. 38 -fold increased odds of early menarche (95 % CI, 1. 01 e 1. 87). Compared with no abuse, the odds of early menarche was 1. 60 -fold among women with childhood sexual abuse only (OR, 1. 60; 95 % CI,. 93 e 2. 74) and 1. 56 -fold for those with both physical and sexual abuse (OR, 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 07 e 2. 25) during childhood.

Objective We examined associations of childhood physical and sexual abuse with risk of intimate partner violence (IPV). We also evaluated the extent to which childhood abuse was associated with self-reported general health status and symptoms of antepartum depression in a cohort of pregnant Peruvian women. Methods In-person interviews were conducted to collect information regarding history of childhood abuse and IPV from 1, 521 women during early pregnancy. Antepartum depressive symptomatology was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI). Results Any childhood abuse was associated with 2. 2 -fold increased odds of lifetime IPV (95 %CI: 1. 72 – 2. 83). Compared with women who reported no childhood abuse, those who reported both, childhood physical and sexual abuse had a 7. 14 -fold lifetime risk of physical and sexual IPV (95 %CI: 4. 15 – 12. 26). The odds of experiencing physical and sexual abuse by an intimate partner in the past year was 3. 33 -fold higher among women with a history of childhood physical and sexual abuse as compared to women who were not abused as children (95 %CI 1. 60 – 6. 89). Childhood abuse was associated with higher odds of self-reported poor health status during early pregnancy (aOR = 1. 32, 95 %CI: 1. 04 – 1. 68) and with symptoms of antepartum depression (aOR = 2. 07, 95 %CI: 1. 58 – 2. 71).

Electronic retrievals were conducted in Medline (via PubMed, 1950 - 2013. 12), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), Embase (via OVID 1974 - 2013. 12), and the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE). The bibliographies of relevant clinical trials were also checked. Randomized controlled trials satisfying the inclusion criteria were evaluated, with data extraction done independently by two well-trained investigators. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with a third member of the review team. Ten studies were included, but meta-analysis could not be conducted because of the significant differences among articles. All but one article demonstrated that midazolam could relieve anxiety. One article demonstrated that propofol offered superior anxiolysis, with more rapid recovery than with midazolam. Compared with lorazepam and diazepam, midazolam did not distinctly dominate in its sedative effect, but was safer. Two articles used midazolam in multidrug intravenous sedation and proved it {{to be more effective}} than midazolam alone.

Our {{aim was to}} determine whether a <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> using a multimedia tool, a model found to be effective in the USA, is an acceptable, feasible, and cost-effective model when translated to a UK setting. DESIGN: Between 14 (th) Jan to 12 (th) May 2010, a Health advisor (HA) approached 19 - 65 year olds at a central London acute medical admissions unit (AAU) and offered a rapid HIV point of care test (POCT) with the aid of an educational video. Patients with negative results had the option to watch a post-test video providing risk-reduction information. For reactive results the HA arranged a confirmatory test, and ensured linkage into HIV specialist care. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through surveys and uptake rates. Costs per case of HIV identified were established. RESULTS: Of the 606 eligible people admitted during the pilot period, 324 (53. 5 %) could not be approached or testing was deemed inappropriate. In total 23. 0 % of eligible admissions had an HIV POCT. Of the patients who watched the video and had not recently tested for HIV, 93. 6 % (131 / 140) agreed to an HIV test; four further patients had an HIV test but did not watch the video. Three tests (2. 2 %, 3 / 135) were reactive and all were confirmed HIV positive on laboratory testing. 97. 5 % felt HIV testing in this setting was appropriate, and 90. 1 % liked receiving the information via video. The cost per patient of the intervention was £ 21. DISCUSSION: Universal POCT HIV testing in an acute medical setting, facilitated by an educational video and <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> appears to be acceptable, feasible, effective, and low cost.

40|$|Background: Patient {{involvement}} in research (PI) can provide complementary views on research priorities, as patients possess experiential knowledge about their disease. In order to sustainably embed PI, knowledge on potential facilitators and barriers is needed. In {{a case study}} at the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, these factors were reflexively explored and applied by involving patients in setting {{the agenda of the}} sarcoma research group. Methods: We adopted the participatory research approach Reflexive Monitoring in Action to facilitate a system innovation towards PI. Using Transition Theory as the theoretical framework, cultural, structural and practical factors facilitating or impeding (the embedding of) PI were analyzed. The niche-initiative was evaluated by 15 in-depth interviews with those involved, and systematic observations during (reflexive) meetings. Sustainable embedding of PI was further propagated and evaluated by linking with policy staff. Preliminary results: PI in the sarcoma research group has rooted. Patients formulated research needs, stakeholders jointly selected a relevant question and developed a research proposal. On the niche level this concrete result aided in a cultural transition of valuing PI. However, on the structural and practical level the flexibility to adapt conventional procedures to suit PI is limited and PI activities are regarded supplementary rather than routine. Scaling up of PI to the regime level is facilitated by external conditions (health funds requiring PI in grant allocations); however, a <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> is pivotal. Conclusions: PI is cherished at the niche-level; a concrete result (a patient-driven research proposal) can inspire change agents and needs to be accompanied by a structural and practical transition. Dissemination of quick wins and stakeholders’ experiences is recommended. Scaling up of PI to the regime-level is a complex process requiring attention to the cultural, structural and practical domain. Main messages 1.

40|$|Project (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. This {{qualitative}} study explored the potentially dangerous absent without official leave (AWOL) behavior among adolescents {{who were in}} group-type foster care facilities. This research is done {{from the perspective of}} the direct care staff of the targeted agency. The considerations were the agency policy regarding AWOL behavior, the perceived efficacy of the current interventions in response to threats of AWOL as well as actual AWOL behavior and how the staff responds to the returning AWOL teen. Staff training and the efficacy of the current interventions were the focus of the interviews. One recommendation derived from an analysis of data is for the court and the county agency responsible for the children in the parents' stead to reconsider the 'no contact' rule often put in place when children are taken into protective custody. With regard to the use of behavioral interventions, staff should refrain from using punitive interventions in response to inappropriate behavior that disallow participation in activities. Rather than restricting access, staff should encourage the teens to engage in appropriate, structured, and planned community activities wit their peers and cottage staff that may distract them, and/or allow them to find a connection with other teens or staff. Another recommendation is that agencies employ a <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> who is in place to step in and mentor teens that are having a particularly difficult time adjusting to the situation. This mentor would be available 24 / 7 to the teen to explain policy, resolve issues, and address specific problems. Part of the reason teens go AWOL is because they are seeking someone who will understand and be sensitive to their situation; someone to whom they feel connected. The mentor may also be the person in the program who conducts a screening as part of the intake process to identify red flags and rate each teen's propensity to run, as well as the person to debrief the teen if they are returning from an AWOL absence. The last recommendation is for the agency to develop a plan, team, or committee who will follow up when a child AWOLs to investigate what happened, identify indicators that may have been missed, examine debriefing notes, and draft a report that makes specific recommendations for future situations to prevent the chance of overlooking the same signs in the future.

40|$|As {{sea level}} rise {{continues}} to occur {{on a global}} scale, coastal cities need to be evaluating the risk and potential impacts it will have on their communities and developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to effectively handle these changes. With projections anticipating a sea level rise as high as four feet within the next 100 years, Charleston needs to be considering strategies to preserve and protect its coastlines, historical and cultural assets, natural resources, and its infrastructure. Currently, the City has taken little initiative to proactively plan and adapt for the impending effects of sea level rise. Although the Charleston Green Plan demonstrates {{an interest in the}} resiliency and sustainability of the City, it is not a sufficient or comprehensive response to sea level rise. As such, we recommend that Charleston seek regional support through the creation of a regional climate compact between the five coastal counties in South Carolina. By collaborating in a regional compact, more resources, staff, and funding will be available to work on strategic planning than would otherwise be available at the local level. Additionally, regional collaboration will demonstrate to the State that sea level rise is an important issue to these coastal counties and support at the state level is needed. Secondly, more initiative and political will is needed at the local level to promote more sustainable practices and encourage collaboration between local scientists, residents, policy makers, business owners, etc. {{in order to create a}} plan of action for sea level rise. Ideally, the City would hire a <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> to serve as the primary contact for planning, as well as, lead community engagement, education, and outreach programs. However, if that is not an option, local government should provide platforms (conferences, meetings, educational opportunities, etc.) for the community to begin discussing the ways in which they would like to see the city take action against sea level rise. Thirdly, while beachfront development may be profitable for the region, it further erodes the beach and is at high risk of being destroyed in light of sea level rise. As such, Charleston should revise the Beachfront Management Act of 1988 to no longer allow DHEC to move the baseline seaward, regardless of accretion processes. Although Charleston’s sea level rise adaptation and mitigation strategy may still be unclear, with sea level rise predictions as high as 4 feet within the next 100 years, it is clear action is needed to preserve and protect the city for generations to come...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{planning}} {{efforts have}} become increasingly prevalent in resource management initiatives, particularly in water conservation planning. This report informs {{the development of a}} water conservation plan for the Roaring Fork Conservancy, Ruedi Water and Power Authority, and the Community Office of Resource Efficiency in Colorado’s Roaring Fork Watershed. Six cases of regional water conservation planning strategies across the Western United States are examined. The case studies provide insights and lessons learned about collaborative planning, the Colorado Water Conservation Board planning process, and regional plans with water conservation strategies focused on increasing instream flows. Several recommendations are offered for those seeking to develop a regional water conservation plan. The planning process should be open and transparent, to encourage various stakeholders to participate. The roles and responsibilities of plan participants should be established clearly and equitably. A plan should be flexible enough to accommodate different interests and needs, while maintaining a unifying mechanism or vision to sustain regional collaboration. Plan developers should maintain outreach to critical stakeholder groups and partner with them on plan development and implementation. Establishing a <b>dedicated</b> regional <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> to coordinate and manage plan implementation is important, as is establishing a dedicated funding source for plan development and implementation. Plan champions should be cultivated, and implementation incentivized. An overview of education and outreach campaign strategies that could be employed by the clients as part of a regional water conservation outreach campaign is provided. Emphasis is placed on strategies directed at changing individual water conservation behaviors. An analysis of ecological and hydrologic conditions on the Lower Crystal River that could motivate compliance with a regional water conservation plan is also provided. While the report was conducted for clients in Colorado’s Roaring Fork Watershed, many of the lessons and themes should be of interest to others involved in regional water conservation planning...|$|R
