Based on {{the general}} {{geometrical}} model of scroll compression chamber for scroll fluid machine, the geometric characteristics of scroll compression chamber, such as width, length, volume, and comprehensive curvature radius at the mesh point, and their variation as well are comprehensively analyzed.

At the high Z regions, flow softening occurred resulting from the dynamic recrystallization but below 1010 of Z value, flow hardening occurred due to the grain growth.

A novel severe plastic deformation technique entitled tubular channel angular pressing process was recently proposed and experimented. The current study investigates the influences of ultrasonic vibration (UV) amplitudes in axial and radial directions on the deformation behavior and required punch force of TCAP process using finite element analysis. The numerical {{results indicated that the}} magnitude of imposed effective strain and the uniformity of strain distribution are enhanced by applying ultrasonic vibration.

Furthermore, a much lower punch load is required by adding vibration amplitude.

We have demonstrated that model bioparticles such as inclusion bodies (spheres of about 1 mu m in size) Escherichia coli cells (rods 1 x 3 mu m), yeast cells (8 mu m spheres), and synthetic microgel particles (0. 4 mu m spheres) are binding via different affinity interactions (IgG antibody-protein A, sugar-lectin, and metal ion-chelate) to a macroporous hydrogel (MH) matrix bearing appropriate ligands. The elastic deformation of the MH results in the detachment of affinity bound bioparticles.

40|$|Flapping wing {{efficiency}} {{is limited by}} flow separation effects. The time dependent development of a leading edge vortex (LEV) during rapid pitch-up motion of a retreating helicopter roter blade is known as dynamic stall vortex. Movement of this vortex along the airfoil upper surface first increases lift but later the vortex lifts off the airfoil surface causing streng drag rise, severe nose-down pitching moments, and possibly negative aerodynamic damping. Very similar effects can be observed on flapping airfoils and wings experiencing combined plunging (heaving) motion and pitching motion. With increasing plunge amplitude the flow on the flapping wing starts to separate and concentrated dynamic stall vortices may develop on both upper and lower wing surfaces. Under these conditions it is shown that wing propulsion {{efficiency is}} considerably reduced. Recent investigations of dynamic stall control have shown that a streng vortex may be avoided by appropriate airfoil deformation. lt will be shown in the present paper that with dynamic airfoil <b>deformation</b> the propulsion <b>efficiency</b> can be improved considerably.

In order to solve this task, an experiment is carried out on a construction site, with dipping a pile, with the following types of dynamic influences: driving in with a diesel, mechanical and hydraulic drop hammers (with the frequency, respectively, 50; 15 - 20; 100 hits per minute); by the method of vibrational immersion with the frequency of oscillation 1440 per minute and {{with the use of}} a vibrational pile driver with the frequency of 420 hits per minute. Vibrational-percussive pile driving was done with a free-falling springless vibrational pile driver weighing 4. 7 - 6. 7 tons and with the relation to the driving force from 0. 25 to 0. 36. Using these methods, 4 - 6 piles of flat profile and u-shape, with the length of 8 - 11 m were driven into the cushion. As a result of experiments aimed at finding the criterion of the maximum speed and depth of pile driving without significant <b>deformation,</b> the <b>efficiency</b> was estimated for percussive and vibrational-percussive methods with increased frequency of hits and a small height of dropping the hammer.

40|$|Campi Flegrei is {{a unique}} {{volcanic}} region located near Naples, Italy. Anomalous crustal movements at Pozzuoli in Campi Flegrei have been documented since the Roman period. The movements were gradual and have continued to the present, occasionally accompanying swarms of local earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Generally the movements proceed with low seismicity. After the 1538 eruption of Monte Nuovo, Pozzuoli had subsided monotonously, but it changed to uplift abruptly in 1969. The uplift accelerated in 1983 and 1984 reaching more than 2 m, and thereafter began to subside. Many discussions of this event have been published. In Japan, we have examples of deformations similar to those at Campi Flegrei, mainly in volcanic areas, and rarely in non-volcanic areas. The former includes Iwojima, Miyakejima and Aira caldera while the latter is represented by Cape Omaezaki. Iwojima is a volcano island, and its secular uplifts since the 18 th century are recognized as an unusual event. Miyakejima volcano and Aira caldera exhibited anomalous movements with low seismicity after their eruptions. Cape Omaezaki is not situated in volcanic zone but near a subduction zone, and gradually and continuously subsides as a precursor to a large earthquake. In such cases as Campi Flegrei and the Japanese localities, we would question whether the deformations are accompanied by normal seismicity or low seismicity. To examine quantitatively the relationship between seismicity and related <b>deformation,</b> seismic <b>efficiency</b> is generally useful. The crustal deformations in all the regions cited above are characterized by exceptionally low seismic efficiencies. In the present paper, the deformations at Pozzuoli and Iwojima are mainly described and a comparative discussion among these and other localities in Japan is supplemented. It is concluded that such anomalous phenomena in volcanic areas are attributable to peculiar rheological aspects of the material composing the local upper crust, and the deformation in a non-volcanic area is of tectonic origin. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work 3 D-kinematics of the Earth's surface {{deformations}} is in detail analyzed. For this purpose, two new approaches are implemented that are based on the Lagrangian and Isoparametric representations of deformation. Although from mathematical point of view, the study of the 3 D-kinematics of deformations looks a straightforward extension of its counterpart in two-dimensions; characteristics like the network configuration raise complexities that challenges this process. It is shown that the 3 D-representation of the Earth's surface deformations is an ill-posed problem. The conditioning of the problem has been analytically and numerically analyzed. In this connection, a diagnosis method has been formulated for the sensitivity analysis of <b>deformation</b> tensor. The <b>efficiency</b> of this method has been verified using the simulated deformations of this study. The stability of least-squares solution for the 3 D-Isoparametric and Lagrangian representations of the synthetic and real deformations of this study has been analyzed by the discrete Picard condition. Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) is proposed as a simple and efficient technique for regularizing the solution when the stability of least-squares solution is not assured. To come up with a tradeoff between the stability and resolution of regularized solutions, perturbation theory of the TSVD solution is used for finding an optimum regularization parameter. The efficiency of the method has been verified by analyzing the relative errors for synthetic deformations. Regularized solutions conform to the other available results on the post-seismic pattern of crustal deformations in the test area of this study. A statistical method has been devised for analyzing the deformation changes in space or time which is based on the assumptions that strain tensor elements are normally distributed and that no gross error are present among the deformations to be analyzed. Using this method, it is not only possible to statistically analyze the significance of the change in deformations, but also to localize the variations that were statistically asserted in the previous step. The method is partially based on the Procrustes analysis of deformation tensors. Therefore, it is given here the name of Procrustean Statistical Inference of Deformations. To localize the deformation changes, procrustean residuals are screened. Thereby significant changes are statistically assigned to certain parameters of deformation. For this purpose, BIBER robust estimator has been modified and used. In modified BIBER-estimator both the quality of residuals and the redundancy of observations are taken into account. For this purpose, the threshold of minimum detectable deformation changes (internal reliabilities of observations) has been implemented in the loss function of the modified BIBER-estimator. The application of the new (robust) estimator makes it possible to assign a certain probability to the detected significantly changed parameters of <b>deformation.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of the method has been analyzed by simulated deformation changes. Moreover, the method is implemented in the test area of this study to analyze the spatial variations of three-dimensional deformations. In this study, also an attempt is made to formulate the effect of the GPS systematic errors on the parameters of deformation. As the result, a set of deterministic models have been developed that formulates possible deviations of the parameters of deformation when some residual or unavoidable systematic errors are expected to be present in the GPS results...|$|R

In our study, we sample the heart motion sparsely at intersections of three sets of orthogonal tagging planes and then use a new meshless deformable model to recover the dense 3 D motion of the myocardium temporally during the cardiac cycle. We compute external forces at tag intersections based on tracked local motion and redistribute the force to meshless particles throughout the myocardium.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{fluid flow}} {{simulation}} study {{was performed to}} investigate potential contrasts in reservoir performance between models displaying a soft-linked relay ramp vs. models with a continuous fault. The relay ramp model {{is based on a}} well-exposed outcrop analogue – the Delicate Arch Ramp, Arches National Park, Utah. In outcrop, the relay ramp exhibits a pervasive system of cataclastic deformation bands, which were mapped and incorporated into the reservoir simulation models. Several models were simulated, using deformation-band per-meability as the main variable tested. Results show that when compared to flow across continuous faults, the presence of soft-linked relay ramps enhances net flow across the fault zone in all tested scenarios. Comparing models with deformation bands to the model that includes the ramp but no deformation bands illustrates that, although having an impact on flow tortuosity and sweep <b>efficiency,</b> <b>deformation</b> bands must have a very low permeability and be numerous before having a negative impact on recovery. Deformation bands with midrange permeabilities were shown to {{have a positive effect on}} recovery in the relay models, as they increase flow tortuosity and enhance sweep, causing later water breakthrough and prolonging production.

40|$|In close-range photogrammetry, {{situations}} {{can arise}} {{in which it}} is difficult or impossible to establish a network of control points as required for a conventional absolute orientation procedure. The thesis investigates the replacement of the traditional control network by a few control distances measured between well-defined artificial markers or natural feature points. The measured distances must then serve to reduce deformations suffered by the photogrammetric model in the orientation procedures. All investigations are based on analytical rather than analogue photogrammetry. After a review of the concepts of rotation matrices, least squares adjustment and the generation of synthetic image co-ordinate observations, the study is executed in three major steps. A test field of high precision is established by means of space intersection and a camera calibration method for close-range cameras is developed which combines perspective projection with geodetic observations of the lens system parameters. Thus a problem inherent in many camera calibration methods, namely the exact determination of the perspective centre, is largely overcome. Deformation characteristics related to error in elements of interior and relative orientation are determined by the controlled introduction of errors into these elements. The deformations are presented in tabular and diagrammatical form. An analysis of the deformation leads to the conclusions of theoretical and practical relevance for close-range photogrammetry. As a result of the deformation analysis mathematical models are introduced which utilise the measured distances for the reduction of model <b>deformations.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of homogeneous scaling, affine scaling and convergency correction, as applied individually and in various combinations, is tested. A mathematical formulation of the converging correction as a restraining condition in a least squares adjustment is developed for this purpose. It is shown that a convergency error is less relevant to close-range photogrammetry than generally assumed and that characteristic model deformations in close-range photogrammetry have the character of affine scale errors. Throughout the thesis algorithms are developed which make it possible to execute all computations on computers with limited memory capacity. A program sample for the relative orientation adjustment is given in Appendix IV to demonstrate the memory saving techniques.

40|$|Wind load {{is really}} the result of wind {{pressures}} acting on the building surfaces during a wind event. This wind pressure is primarily {{a function of the}} wind speed because the pressure or load increases with the square of the wind velocity. Structural walls, or shear walls, are elements used to resist lateral loads, such as those generated by wind and earthquakes. Structural walls are considerably deeper than typical beams or columns. This attribute gives structural walls considerable in-plane stiffness which makes structural walls a natural choice for resisting lateral loads. In addition to considerable strength, structural walls can dissipate a great deal of energy if detailed properly. Walls are an invaluable structural element when protecting buildings from seismic events. Buildings often rely on structural walls as the main lateral force resisting system. Shear walls are required to perform in multiple ways. Shear walls can then be designed to limit building damage to the specified degree. The loaddeformation response of the structural walls must be accurately predicted and related to structural damage in order to achieve these performance goals under loading events of various magnitudes. The applied load is generally transferred to the wall by a diaphragm or collector or drag member. The performance of the framed buildings depends on the structural system adopted for the structure The term structural system or structural frame in structural engineering refers to load-resisting sub-system of a structure. The structural system transfers loads through interconnected structural components or members. These structural systems need to be chosen based on its height and loads and need to be carried out, etc. The selection of appropriate structural systems for building must satisfy both strength and stiffness requirements. The structural system must be adequate to resist lateral and gravity loads that cause horizontal shear deformation and overturning <b>deformation.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of a structural system is measured in terms of their ability to resist lateral load, which increases with the height of the frame.

Is proposing the new structure of a plate-pile foundation, which overcomes the drawbacks of the existing design solutions and methods of consruction their, as well as is proposing an engineering method of a determination of basic parameters. Conclusion. Is proposes the new structure of a plate-pile foundation and the method of a determination of basic parameters his in the design of a soil base to the maximum permissible <b>deformation</b> Su buildings. <b>Efficiency</b> of application this type plate-pile foundation obtained by rational distribution resistance between a plate and piles, when under load from the building to the first work fully incorporated plate that allows maximum deformed for plate, and then the piles - due to of the hinge connection with the plate. Thus, depending on the maximum permissible deformation for buildings resistance of plate part of a full load of more than 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a molecular pump, the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum is studied using mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics and molecular dynamics. The mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamic description of the pump is compared to the description obtained {{in the framework of}} Hill for kinetic enzyme cycles. By comparing these two descriptions at isothermal conditions, they are found to be equivalent. This supports the validity of the mesoscopic approach. An extension of the mesoscopic non-equilibrium framework to also include a heat flux and the corresponding temperature difference is proposed. This can be used to model phenomena such as non-shivering thermogenesis, a process which lack a theoretical description in the kinetic cycle picture. Further, the heat transfer in the calcium pump is studied using molecular dynamics. This is done in order to obtain phenomenological parameters {{that can be used for}} the modeling of thermogenesis. A non-stationary non-equilibrium molecular dynamics approach is developed, which may be used to study heat transfer between a small object and the surrounding solvent. This methodology is applied to the calcium pump solvated in water. It is found that the thermal conductivity of the protein is low (0. 2 W K− 1 m− 1) compared to water (0. 6 WK− 1 m− 1). This means that the protein may sustain a large temperature gradient across its structure. The simulations also show that the protein-water surface is important for the heat transfer. The time scale for vibrational energy relaxation is found to be of order 10 – 100 ps which strengthens the local equilibrium assumption of mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics is also applied to calculate the thermodynamic efficiency of the calcium pump embedded in lipid bilayers of varying length and from different tissues. This is done in order to show the applicability of mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics to interpret experimental data. The thermodynamic efficiency is found to be low (< 13 %) in all cases for the experimental conditions considered, which means that a large amount of the energy released from the ATP-hydrolysis is dissipated as heat. A complementary molecular dynamics study targeted on a bilayer for which the protein shows a relatively large efficiency (compared to other bilayers) shows that membrane <b>deformation</b> and large <b>efficiency</b> are not mutually exclusive. Overall, this thesis highlights the usefulness of the mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamic framework applied to molecular machines and energy transduction and dissipation in these. The main result is that the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework is applicable to molecular pumps and can be extended to include heat effects. This framework is general and can be applied to other molecular machines as well. Further, the results also support the notion that the calcium pump may contribute to non-shivering thermogenesis in certain tissues. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
