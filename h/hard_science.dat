5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 <b>hard</b> <b>science</b> fiction {{novel by}} Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of <b>hard</b> <b>science</b> fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{philosophers}} and sociologists of science {{have questioned the}} relationship between these characteristics and perceived hardness or softness. The more [...] "developed" [...] <b>hard</b> <b>sciences</b> do not necessarily have a greater degree of consensus or selectivity in accepting new results. Commonly cited methodological differences are also not a reliable indicator. Psychologists use controlled experiments and economists use mathematical modelling, but as social sciences both are usually considered soft sciences, while natural sciences such as biology do not always aim to generate testable predictions. There are some measurable differences between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>sciences.</b> For example, <b>hard</b> <b>sciences</b> make more extensive use of graphs, and soft sciences are more prone to a rapid turnover of buzzwords.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe color, {{with the}} particularity {{to be defined}} {{simultaneously}} as a physical quantity and as a psychophysical quantity, {{is one of the}} concepts that can link <b>hard</b> <b>sciences</b> and behavioural sciences. From the viewpoint of behavioural sciences, colors are basically measured with nominal scales. in <b>hard</b> <b>sciences,</b> colors are measured with interval scales. Our hypothesis is that the main relation that must be preserved during a color measurement is a metric. We suggest then that colors must be measured with metrical scales. The fuzzy metrical scale is preferred due to the possibility to define it like a nominal scale...|$|R

We compare {{the accuracy of the}} first national evaluation exercise, conducted entirely by peer-review, to other rankings lists prepared at zero cost, based on indicators indirectly linked to performance or available on the Internet. The results show that, for the <b>hard</b> <b>sciences,</b> the costs of conducting the Italian evaluation of research institutions could have been completely avoided...|$|R

The novel originated as a screenplay by Sagan and Ann Druyan (whom he later married) in 1979; when development of the film stalled, Sagan decided to convert the stalled film into a novel. The film concept was subsequently revived and eventually released in 1997 as the film Contact starring Jodie Foster.|$|E

25|$|Speculative evolution, {{also called}} {{speculative}} biology and speculative zoology, is a subgenre {{of science fiction}} and an artistic movement, focused on hypothetical scenarios {{in the evolution of}} life.

With a strong connection to and basis in science, particularly biology, speculative evolution is often considered <b>hard</b> <b>science</b> fiction. Speculative biology and creature concepts are also a prevalent subject in concept art.|$|E

Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
