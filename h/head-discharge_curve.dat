40|$|The {{geometry}} of the inlet has a significant bearing on the relationship headwater elevation and discharge for culverts with a free outlet. The relative importance of inlet design depends upon {{the location of the}} control section. The primary purpose of the research reported here was to examine the effect of inlet design upon the <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curve</b> of a model culvert. Two types of flush inlets, selected to represent extreme conditions for flush inlets, were tested [...] a square-edged inlet and a well rounded inlet. For each inlet the <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curve</b> was measured and the two curves compared. The comparison indicated that for certain conditions an appreciable head-advantage was gained by using a rounded inlet. Observation and analysis of the flow characteristics indicated that this gain phenomenon occurred in the region where for the same head a square-edged inlet caused separation and inhibited full flow, while the rounded inlet promoted full flow in the culvert with a corresponding increase in discharge. In connection with measurements to establish friction factors and entrance losses in the model culvert for use in the analysis of the experimental, a few behavior curves were determined. An analysis of behavior curves is included in Appendix IV. The results obtained were compared with experimental curves and other published curves.

40|$|The {{full scale}} model test {{described}} here was initiated {{to examine the}} effect of suspended air bubbles on the performance of a CGN 38 seawater circulating pump. A Carver pump*Type 13 N, Serial No. 110709, was chosen as the test model. This is a single suction, vertical discharge, horizontal suction pump. It has a single stage impeller and is capable of delivering 3000 gpm at a total dynamic head of 10 psi at 1150 rpm. The impeller was trimmed by the pump manufacturer to provide the desired <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curve</b> near the rated flow condition.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{pipeline system}} with a multistage centrifugal pump was used to study the effect of transient operations on the hydrodynamic performance of a centrifugal pump. Several transient flow operations were considered, ranging from very mild to severe transients. The dynamic relationship of total pressure rise across the pump to the flow rate was {{compared with that of}} the steady state. Deviation between the dynamic pump head and the value given by the steady-state curve at the same instantaneous discharge was established and found to be a function of the severity of the transient. It was found that severe flow conditions could cause this deviation to exceed 30 % of the steady-state value. The use of the steady-state pump head-discharge relationship in the solution of transient pipe flow by the method of characteristics (MOC) is discussed. It was found that the steady-state pump <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curve</b> was not accurate enough to support the solution of unsteady pipe flow application by the MOC...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a culvert inlet has a {{significant}} bearing upon {{the relationship of the}} head to the discharge of a culvert. Its relative importance hinges upon the type of flow occurring in the culvert, which in turn is governed by the location of the control section. For part-full flow the control may be either at the inlet or the outlet depending on whether the slope is hydraulically steep or mild. In the case of short culverts, control may be at the inlet even for horizontal or mild slopes. For full flow, barrel friction provides the control. The <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curves</b> of culverts having square-edge inlets have been compared with those for culverts having rounded inlets to illustrate the conditions for which a head-advantage may be obtained by using a rounded inlet. These comparisons have been made for three categories of culvert flow: long culverts on steep slopes, long culverts on mild slopes, and short culverts. Dimensionless <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curves</b> have been plotted for culvert flow in each category. For culverts on steep slopes, experimental data have been compared with the computed values and, since the agreement was reasonably good, serve as a basis for the analysis of flow in culverts operating under conditions other than those for which the tests were made. The greatest head-advantage for a particular discharge of the rounded inlet over that of a square-edge inlet was found for those cases in which the control section was located at the inlet. These were long culverts on steep slopes or short culverts where the length was negligible. for long culverts on mild slopes, the head-advantage was far less pronounced...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} model PUMPCOM {{has been developed}} to combine pump curves series and in parallel {{for a variety of}} pumping stations using a WINDOWS environment. The model determines the performance of a pump station and of individual pumps within the station via construction of <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curves,</b> efficiency curves and curves indicating net positive suction head requeriments, graphical interface allows the user to draw the pump station layout on sreen, to view discrete data entered, and to view the fit of polynomial equations. An icon "tool box" allows the user to select an appropriate pipe fixture and place it in the layout between pumps. This allowns the pump station drawing to resemble as closely as possible the real pump station. Data tables, plots of the curves and equation coefficients, and station layout can be printed. Polynomial equations as fitted to individual pump curves and to the combined pump station curves. Cubic spline interpolations is employed to combine curves of pumps having different sizes. Performance indicators of the station and of each pump within the station are calculated over flow rate range for the entire station. 199...|$|R
40|$|<b>Head-discharge</b> <b>curves</b> in gated spillways are {{commonly}} obtained {{by means of}} the application of empirical formulations. The most popular one, recommended by SPANCOLD [1], was developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers [2]. It is based in several experimental campaigns whose results were used to define a chart which provides the value of the discharge coefficient depending on the gate position. This formula {{does not take into account}} the effect of side contractions, which depends on the length-height ratio of the bays, as well as the head, the inflow conditions and spillway geometry. Thus, it is necessary to carry out specific experimental tests for every new spillway. The aim of the work is the analysis of the discharge capacity of radial gated spillways. The accuracy of empirical formulations has been studied, and Oliana Dam spillway has been investigated via numerical simulation. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The closed conduit {{spillway}} is any conduit {{having a}} closed cross section through which water is spilled. The inlet and outlet {{may be of}} any type. The barrel may be of any size or shape and may flow either full or partly full. Also, the barrel may be on any slope. This broad definition includes the smallest culvert {{as well as the}} largest morning glory spillway. The basic theory of the flow is the same for each of the many forms which the spillway may take. This paper discusses the control of the flow through closed conduit spillways by weirs, the barrel exit, tailwater, pipe, orifice, and short tube, since each of these controls may govern, at some time or other, the rate of flow through the spillway. The effect of these various controls on the performance of the spillway is explained. A means of developing a composite <b>head-discharge</b> <b>curve</b> is given. Pressures within the closed conduit spillway must sometimes be determined, so the methods for this determination are presented. A selected bibliography useful to the understanding and for the design of closed conduit spillways concludes this technical paper.

40|$|The {{problem of}} filling a {{vertical}} tank {{connected to a}} centrifugal pump with a long pipe is investigated in this paper. An equation for estimating the time of filling the tank is presented. The equation accounts for the discharge variation resulting from the instantaneous intersections of pump <b>head-discharge</b> characteristic <b>curve</b> and the pipe system curve. The equation {{is based on the}} assumption of wholly rough turbulent flow and hence a constant coefficient of friction for the pipe. Two practical numerical examples are given to compare the calculations of the time equation and those based on the simplifying assumption of constant pumping discharge. It is found that the approximate estimation of time may be in error by more than 27 %. A computer program for accute estimation of the time of filling a tank which accounts for the instantaneous variation of the coefficient of friction is provided. A number of graphs are plotted to compare the results of the program and those of the equation considering a wide range of variables. It is found that the accute computer results are in close agreement with the equation result...|$|R
