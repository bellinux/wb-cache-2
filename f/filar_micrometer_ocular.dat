50|$|The {{precursor}} to the <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> was the micrometer eyepiece, invented by William Gascoigne.|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} of <b>filar</b> <b>micrometers</b> in astronomical telescopes was {{measuring}} {{the distance between}} double stars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Filar</b> <b>micrometers</b> {{are little}} used in modern astronomy, having been {{replaced}} by digital photographic techniques where digital pixels provide a precise reference for image distance. However, filar eyepieces are still used in teaching astronomy and by some amateur astronomers.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> is a {{specialized}} eyepiece used in astronomical telescopes for astrometry measurements, in microscopes for specimen measurements, and in alignment and surveying telescopes for measuring angles and distances on nearby objects. The word filar derives [...] It {{refers to the}} fine threads or wires used in the device.|$|R
50|$|For astronomical uses, reticles {{could be}} simple {{crosshair}} designs or more elaborate designs for special purposes. Telescopes used for polar alignment {{could have a}} reticle that indicates the position of Polaris relative to the north celestial pole. Telescopes that are used for very precise measurements would have a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> as a reticle; this could be adjusted by the operator to measure angular distances between stars.|$|R

Automated plate-measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of star catalogues. In the 1980s, charge-coupled devices (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond.|$|R

50|$|A typical <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> {{consists}} of a micrometer and a reticle that has two fine parallel wires or threads that can be moved by the observer using a micrometer screw mechanism. The wires are placed in the focal image plane of the eyepiece so they remain sharply superimposed over the object under observation, while the micrometer motion moves the wires across the focal plane. Other designs employ a fixed reticle, against which one wire or a second reticle moves. By rotating the eyepiece assembly in the eyetube, the measurement axis can be aligned to match {{the orientation of the}} two points of observation.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th century that they were {{gradually}} superseded by large reflecting telescopes for professional astronomy. A great refractor was often the centerpiece of a new 19th century observatory, but was typically used with an entourage of other astronomical instruments such as a Meridian Circle, a Heliometer, and Astrograph, and a smaller refractor such as a Comet Seeker or Equatorial. Great refractors were often used for observing double stars and equipped with a <b>Filar</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Numerous discoveries of minor planets, satellites, the planet Neptune, and double stars were made, and pioneering work on astrophotography was done, with great refractors.|$|R
50|$|The first {{successful}} measurements of stellar parallax (to determine {{the distance to}} a star) were made by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a Fraunhofer heliometer. This was the 6.2 in aperture Fraunhofer heliometer at Königsberg Observatory built by Joseph von Fraunhofer's firm, {{though he did not}} live to see it delivered to Bessel. Although the heliometer was difficult to use, it had certain advantages for Bessel including a wider field of view compared to other great refractors of the period, and overcame atmospheric turbulence in measurements compared to a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{application}} of the divided object-glass and the employment of double images in astronomical measures is due to Servington Savary from Exeter in 1743. Pierre Bouguer, in 1748, originated the true conception of measurement by double image without the auxiliary aid of a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer,</b> that is by changing the distance between two object-glasses of equal focus. John Dollond, in 1754, combined Savary's idea of the divided object-glass with Bouguer's method of measurement, resulting {{in the construction of}} the first really practical heliometers. As far as we can ascertain, Joseph von Fraunhofer, some time not long before 1820, constructed the first heliometer with an achromatic divided object-glass, i.e. the first heliometer of the modern type.|$|R
40|$|Individual non-damaged horny {{cells can}} {{be removed from the}} human stratum corneum by a {{modification}} of the corneocyte count technique. Nine sites from four men were sampled and 50 cells from each specimen measured with a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> eyepiece. The longest and shortest diameters in micra and the surface area, calculated as an ellipse in square micra, were determined. Individual horny cells are much larger than previously described in the literature. Small cells, 34 μ to 36 μ in diameter were found on forehead and hand, larger cells, 41 μ to 44 μ are typical for thigh axilla. Highly significant statistical differences for multiple sites of the human body were found when t-tests and the analysis of variance were applied. The regional differences in cell sizes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} histologic, morphometric and nuclear DNA {{content of a}} group of benign and {{malignant}} melanocytic lesions of the iris. Methods. Forty-four surgically excised melanocytic lesions of the iris were histologically classified as nevus or melanoma. Morphometric analysis using a digital <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> (LaSICO 1602 N- 10 and 5 - 4 A) measured the mean size of the 10 largest nucleoli, and Feulgen staining and image cytometry (CAS 200 Cell Analysis Systems) analyzed the nuclear DNA ploidy in the lesions. Patient follow-up information was obtained whenever possible. Results. Sixteen cases were histologically classified as nevi and twenty-eight cases as melanoma. The mean of the 10 largest nucleoli of the nevi was smaller than the mean among the melanomas (1. 772 /an [SD = 0. 366] and 2. 773 fim [SD = 0. 565], respectively). Feulgen staining revealed that all lesions were diploid, with the exception of two hyperdiploid and two hypodiploid melanomas. Of the patients with follow-up information available, none with nevi developed a metastasis and two with melanoma died of metastatic disease. Conclusions. The histologic classification of iris melanocytic lesions (i. e., nevus versus melanoma) correlates to nucleolar size (P < 0. 001) but not to nuclear DNA ploidy. Invest Ophthalmo...|$|R
5000|$|In his Astronomical Memoirs in {{the section}} {{entitled}} 1881, John Tebbutt gave an account of his discovery: [...] This year, like 1861, was signalised by {{the discovery of a}} great comet. While scanning the western sky with the unassisted eye on the evening of May 22, I discovered just below the constellation Columba a hazy looking object which, from my familiarity with that part of the heavens, I regarded as new. On examining it with the small marine telescope previously referred to in these memoirs, I found it to consist really of three objects, namely, two stars of the 4 and 5 magnitude afterwards identified at γ1 and y2 Cæli, and a head of a comet. I could not find any trace of a tail, but on the 25th it exhibited a tail about two degrees in length. Immediately on its discovery I obtained, with the 4 equatorial, eight good measures of the nucleus from one of the bright stars just mentioned. On the following day I notified the discovery to the Government Observatories at Sydney and Melbourne. A series of <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> comparisons was obtained at Windsor, extending from the date of discovery to June 11, when the comet disappeared from our morning sky and became an object for the northern observatories. … ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a three-year study of 105 {{cultures}} of aerobic, non-thermophilic, spore-forming bacteria, a growth-range-tem-perature cell-size relation was incidentally noted, and on two separate occasions at a one-year interval, the rather definite consistency of this concomitancy was observed. Body size of the organisms was always measured in gentian-violet-stained dry preparations with an <b>ocular</b> <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The author was impressed with one fact, which seems of ecological significance: Those cultures having lower minimum and maximum growth temperatures are as a rule larger in cell size than those having higher minimum and maximum growth temperatures. A corollary is that those cultures isolated from material incubated at 450 C. and 50 'C. are usually members of smaller sized species than those isolated from materials kept at room temperature. In this connection {{it is interesting to note}} that many cytological investigations of the nuclear phenomena of bacteria have used spore-forming species isolated from cold-blooded animals such as earthworms, insects, frogs, fish and shellfish. The species isolated are large-celled organisms. Table 1 summarizes data collected for those cultures to which species names have been assigned at the time of writing. Thirty-four other cultures included in the study show the same tendency. Those that resemble the Bacillus megatherium or Bacillus mycoides groups have lower optimum and maximum growth temperatures and show larger sizes than others having higher temperature limits of growth...|$|R
5000|$|Visual {{double star}} {{observation}} was Innes’ main contribution to astronomy. When he started observing {{them as an}} amateur in Australia, the choice plums had already been picked by earlier astronomers, notably James Dunlop and John Herschel. Many of Innes’ discoveries were stars with faint companions that were missed by earlier observers. Most of his labor was the measurement of the relative positions of binary pairs with a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer.</b> All known doubles were periodically re-measured to determine their orbits. With Thiele, Innes formulated a simplified method of specifying double star orbits. These orbital parameters when combined with other measurements, such as radial velocity allow the mass of each star of the binary pair to be determined. Mass, combined with luminosity and temperature or spectral type, is a fundamental parameter needed in theories of stellar structure and stellar evolution. [...] The University of Leyden awarded Innes an honoris causa doctorate in 1923. He retired in 1927. Innes was a first rank chess player. He died suddenly on 13 March 1933 in England while pursuing a 3D cinema idea: He had amused observatory guests with a stereo cinema viewer,and probably had in mind combining its principle {{with that of a}} blink comparator, which he used in finding stars of high proper motion, to make a screen 3D projector.|$|R
40|$|Mockford & Sullivan (1986), {{proposed}} a higher classification of the psocopteran family Lachesillidae, {{in which they}} established the subfamilies Lachesillinae and Eolachesillinae. In the latter subfamily they created two tribes, Eolachesillini and Graphocaeciliini, and dealt with the systematics of the latter. In the Graphocaeciliini they recognised eight genera, including six new genera, and 29 species in total. Subsequently, García Aldrete (2006) erected the genus Waoraniella from the Ecuadorian Amazonia, and established for it the tribe Waoraniellini, in the Eolachesillinae; García Aldrete & Mockford (2011 b) described a second species of that genus, from the Reserva Florestal Ducke, near Manaus, Brazil, and indicated that a third species is known {{to occur in the}} Peruvian Amazonia, near Iquitos; finally, García Aldrete & Mockford (2011 a) described the genus Amazolachesilla, in the Graphocaeciliini, from the Brazilian state of Amazonas. The Amazon basin continues to offer biological novelties: two male specimens of Eolachesillinae: Graphocaeciliini, taken recently in the Peruvian Amazonia, are not assignable in any of the known genera in that tribe. They thus represent a new genus, and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to describe and illustrate it, and to attempt to relate it to the other genera in the tribe. The two specimens available for study were dissected in 80 % ethyl alcohol, and their parts (head, right legs and wings, and genitalia) were mounted on slides in Canada Balsam. Color was recorded by placing the whole specimens, before dissection, under a stereo microscope, illuminated with cold white light at 80 X. Parts on the slides were measured with a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer,</b> and illustrations were made by means of a drawing tube. Abbreviations of parts measured are a...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the initial chemical composition, the mass of a star is a fundamental parameter; it determines {{the life of the}} star from its birth, through its long or short period of luminous glory and to its inevitable end as a compact object. And yet, few stars have actually had their mass accu-rately measured. The programme that has re-cently been undertaken by Dr. Edwin van DesseI of the Royal Observatory in Brussels, Belgium, is therefore of particular importance. By obtain-ing precise measurements of radial velocities of stars in double or multiple systems, Dr. van DesseI expects soon to add new, well-determined stellar masses to the present, all to short list. Observing visual binaries {{is one of the oldest}} arts in astronomy. Rather extensive se ries of observations of double stars have been published, e. g. by F. G. W. Struve (1837 : Stellarum duplicum et multiplicium Mensurae Mi-crometriae, measures made at Oorpat; from 1839 on he observed in Pulkovo with a 15 -inch refractor, then the largest in the world), by Mädler (also at Oorpat, Estland-now Tartu) or by Schiaparelli (1885, Milan). In his private observatory near Milan, later on in Gallarate, Baron Ercole Oembowski accumulated over 20, 000 measures, published in collected form after his death (1881). Quite accurate measurements were performed with often very modest instrumentation. With the observation of a double star we refer to the measurement of the position of the secondary star relative to the primary. The standard equipment has always been a <b>filar</b> <b>micrometer</b> attached to a long-focus refractor. The tradition is still being kept up, e. g. in Nice (Couteau, Muller, with two refractors of 74 cm und 50 cm aperture-the 74 cm has a focal length of 18 m), Washington (Worley...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect on}} new connective tissue attachment of citric acid conditioning and fibronectin-laminin application in treating naturally occurring periodontitis, all 4 quadrants in each of 2 Beagle dogs were used. Each quadrant included: P 2, P 3, P 4, and M 1 teeth. 2 treatment modalities were employed and comparatively analyzed for differences in histological healing respponses at 120 days after surgery. The treatments were: (1) surgery (mucoperiosteal flaps) plus citric acid; (2) surgery plus citric acid followed by fibronectin-laminin application. After scaling and root planing, coronal and root surface reference notches were placed for histometric measurements. Following each of the randomly assigned treatments, flaps were sutured. After sacrifice, tissue blocks of treated areas were decalcified and serially cut, obtaining bucco-lingual and mesiodistal sections. Using a <b>Filar</b> <b>micrometer.</b> 5 distances were masured on the buccal aspect: (1) from root surface notch to alveolar bone crest; (2) from root surface notch to coronal extent of the cementum; (3) from root surface notch to apical extent of the junctional epithelium; 84) from free gingival margin to apical extent of junctional epithelium; (5) from the coronal notch to the alveolar bone crest. Results showed no differences among the 5 measurements between the 2 treatments tested. On mesiodistal sections, surface area determinations {{were made in the}} furcations, evaluating the space occupied by new connective tissue, with or without bone, or by epithelium. For this, images were digitized using a Zeiss IBAS Image analysis system with a 4 mB of array processor memory coupled to a Newvicon TV camera and a microcomputer. Significant differences were found, with increased values for both regenerative connective tissue and bone when surgery plus citric acid was followed by fibronectin-laminin application. Often, these tissues filled completely furcation areas above root surface reference notches...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} as a baseline study to evaluate the nuclear diameter (ND), cell diameter (CD) and nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (N:C) and their variation with age in normal buccal smears of female subjects. Materials and Methods: Buccal smears were collected from 400 apparently healthy individuals. After fixation in 95 % alcohol, the smears were stained using the standard Papanicolaou laboratory procedure. The CD and ND were measured using a stage <b>micrometer</b> and an <b>ocular</b> <b>micrometer.</b> Statistical {{analysis of the data}} was performed using the one-way analysis of variance to evaluate the difference in the ND, CD and N:C with age in females. Multiple range tests by Tukey-honestly significant difference procedure were performed to evaluate the significance between various age groups. Results: The results showed an increase in ND and CD from the 5 - 10 age groups to 15 - 35 age groups. In the 15 - 35 age groups, there was a decline in ND and CD when comparing the first and {{the second half of the}} menstrual cycle, but the difference was not significant.
