40|$|An {{advanced}} diffusion combustor combinig branced air <b>nozzles</b> and branched <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> is proposed. This type of combustor {{is expected}} to be more effective for improvig fuel/air mixing in the combustion chamber than a single-hole air-nozzle diffusion combustor. In this study, nozzle diameter is kept constant, while the angles of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> are varied. Three kinds of combustors having <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> angles of 30 ゜, 45 ゜and 60 ゜are used. For each combustor, deviation angle between air and <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> is set to be 0 ゜, 15 ゜and 45 ゜, respectively.

40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} combustion for aircraft gas turbine engines provides significant opportunities to reduce harmful exhaust emissions. Hydrogen has many advantages (no CO 2 production, high reaction rates, high heating value, and future availability), {{along with some}} disadvantages (high current cost of production and storage, high volume per BTU, and an unknown safety profile when in wide use). One of the primary reasons for switching to hydrogen is the elimination of CO 2 emissions. Also, with hydrogen, design challenges such as fuel coking in the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> and particulate emissions are no longer an issue. However, because it takes place at high temperatures, hydrogen-air combustion can still produce significant levels of NOx emissions. Much of the current research into conventional hydrocarbon-fueled aircraft gas turbine combustors is focused on NOx reduction methods. The Zero CO 2 Emission Technology (ZCET) hydrogen combustion project will focus on meeting the Office of Aerospace Technology goal 2 within pillar one for Global Civil Aviation reducing the emissions of future aircraft {{by a factor of}} 3 within 10 years and by a factor of 5 within 25 years. Recent advances in hydrocarbon-based gas turbine combustion components have expanded the horizons for <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> development. Both new fluid designs and manufacturing technologies have {{led to the development of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> that significantly reduce aircraft emissions. The goal of the ZCET program is to mesh the current technology of Lean Direct Injection and rocket injectors to provide quick mixing, low emissions, and high-performance <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs. An experimental program is planned to investigate the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> concepts in a flametube test rig. Currently, a hydrogen system is being installed in cell 23 at NASA Glenn Research Center's Research Combustion Laboratory. Testing will be conducted on a variety of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> concepts up to combustion pressures of 350 psia and inlet air temperatures of 1200 F.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} a cyclone jet hybrid combustor {{using a combination of}} swirling premixed and jet diffusion flames were experimentally investigated to achieve high flame stability and low pollutant emissions. Two kinds of combustion modes were examined: the diffusion combustion (DC) mode, which consists of swirling air flow and jet diffusion flame, and the hybrid combustion (HC) mode, which consists of swirling premixed and jet diffusion flames. In the HC mode, the effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry on fuel-air mixing were investigated in terms of flame stability and pollutant emissions. The results showed that the HC mode can significantly reduce soot, CO, and NOx emissions in a stable flame region compared to the DC mode. However, CO emission in the HC mode increases drastically when overall equivalence ratios drop below 0. 75. By modifying the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> for the jet diffusion flame, it was found that increases in fuel-air mixing using the improved nozzle provide a stable flame region approximately twice as wide as that of the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> using a single hole.

The structural adequacy of Westinghouse fuel assembly design is evaluated using NRC requirements for combined seismic and LOCA loads per Appendix A to the SRP 4. 2 and the approved methodology (Reference 1). The grid load results for the fuel assembly design in Watts Bar Unit 1 were reviewed. Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the holddown assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical fuel assembly. Because the TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top nozzle adapter plate of the fuel assembly and the rodlets are hanging in the guide thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>nozzle</b> support. The added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on the fuel assembly's dynamic characteristics.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{aspects of the}} liquid fuel placement in a swirl cup were investigated experimentally at elevated pressure. The operating parameter whose effect was investigated was air pressure. Air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) and relative pressure drop were held constant during variations of air pressure. Geometry parameters investigated included swirl angle, <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> axial position and <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow number. Measurement techniques included Mie-scattering laser light sheets for spray visualization, PDA for a detailed spay analysis and LDA for investigation of the air flow field {{in the absence of}} the spray. The test swirl cup geometry consisted of axial segments, so that cross-sectional planes in the interior of the swirl cup were accessible for light sheet imaging and LDA measurements. PDA measurements were conducted downstream of the swirl cup exit plane. Operating conditions realized for PDA measurements were 6, 12 and 18 bar at 700 K. Light sheet imaging and LDA measurements were performed at scaled operating conditions. It was found that the fuel placement is governed overwhelmingly by the airflow swirl angle. The two-phase flow in the swirl cup depends heavily on whether or not there is a recirculation zone within the swirl cup or not. In the absence of a recirculation zone, the radially inward airflow at the upstream end of the swirl cup causes the spray cone generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> to collapse. Subsequent transfer of tangential momentum to the fuel droplets then leads to a re-opening of the spray cone by swirl-induced centrifugal forces. If there is a recirculation zone present within the swirl cup, then the spray generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> is injected into a region of upstream and radially outward flow. This causes some fuel to be present outside of the nominal cone angle of the pressure swirl <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> and ensures that virtually all of the liquid fuel is placed onto the filmer...|$|R

40|$|Stringent {{emissions}} {{requirements for}} stationary gas turbines have produced new challenges in combustor design. In the past, very low NOx pollutant emissions {{have been achieved}} through various combustion modifications, such as steam or water injection, or post-combustion cleanup methods such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR). An emerging approach to NOx abatement is lean premix combustion. Lean premix combustion avoids the cost and operational problems associated with other NOx control methods. By premixing fuel and air at very low equivalence ratios, the high temperatures which produce NOx are avoided. The challenges of premix combustion include avoiding flashback, and ensuring adequate fuel/air premixing. In addition, the combustion must be stable. The combustor should not operate so close to extinction that a momentary upset will extinguish the flame (static stability), and the flame should not oscillate (dynamic stability). Oscillations are undesirable because the associated pressure fluctuations can shorten component lifetime. Unfortunately, experience has shown that premix <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> burning natural gas are susceptible to oscillations. Eliminating these oscillations can be a costly and time consuming part of new engine development. As part of the U. S.
