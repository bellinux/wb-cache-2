40|$|In the Midsouth, soybean {{is often}} grown in close {{proximity}} to rice or in rotation with rice. Herbicides used in rice can injure soybean via drift or carryover. Consequently, field trials were conducted to determine the response of soybean (cv. AG 4703) to <b>imazosulfuron</b> drift and carryover (at Fayetteville, Marianna, Keiser and Pine Tree, AR) from rice. To assess the potential for carryover, soybean was planted into rice fields treated the previous year with <b>imazosulfuron</b> (rotation study). To evaluate in-season sensitivity of soybean to <b>imazosulfuron</b> (tolerance study) relative to halosulfuron, a common sulfonylurea herbicide applied to rice, both <b>imazosulfuron</b> and halosulfuron were applied preemergence (PRE) at varying rates and soybean was immediately seeded into treated plots. For the drift study, <b>imazosulfuron</b> was applied at the VC, V 2, V 6, and R 2 growth stages of soybean at 1 / 256 to 1 / 4 times (X) the labeled rate of <b>imazosulfuron</b> (336 g ai ha- 1). To evaluate carryover potential, <b>imazosulfuron</b> was applied PRE to rice at 112 to 672 g ha- 1 for the rotation study; whereas for the tolerance study, <b>imazosulfuron</b> and halosulfuron were applied at 1 / 256 to 1 / 4 X the labeled rate of <b>imazosulfuron</b> and halosulfuron (52 g ha- 1). Soybean was highly sensitive to <b>imazosulfuron</b> drift, with injury (stunting and purple veins, typical of acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides) resulting at all rates and application timings. At 2 weeks after treatment (2 WAT), topical application of the highest (1 / 4 X) rate of <b>imazosulfuron</b> caused more than 73 % injury at the VC application timing. Soybean recovered from the injury, with little to no injury observed from the lowest four rates of <b>imazosulfuron</b> applied at the VC and V 2 growth stages {{by the end of the}} growing season. For the carryover trial at 2 weeks after planting (2 WAP), soybean exhibited 3 and 13 % injury at Keiser and Pine Tree, respectively, when <b>imazosulfuron</b> was applied to rice the previous year at 672 g ha- 1, a 2 X rate. Injury to soybean was transient and not apparent by the end of the growing season. For the tolerance study, sulfonylurea-tolerant (STS) soybean was not injured. Moreover, no injury was observed on non-STS soybean by PRE-applied <b>imazosulfuron</b> or halosulfuron regardless of herbicide rate, and yield was comparable to the non-treated control. Results of this research indicate that <b>imazosulfuron</b> should be applied with extreme caution to rice as off-target movement will likely cause injury to non-STS soybean (cv. AG 4703) in adjacent fields and applications of <b>imazosulfuron</b> may carryover to non-STS (cv. AG 4703) soybean on silt loam soils having low organic matter and a high soil pH, especially in fields where overlap of an <b>imazosulfuron</b> spray occurred in the preceding rice crop. Under conditions conducive for <b>imazosulfuron</b> to injure soybean via off-target movement or carryover, planting of STS soybean is recommended to avoid possible risks of soybean injury...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{kinetics}} and pathways of {{hydrolytic degradation}} {{is crucial to}} the prediction of the fate and transport mechanism of chemicals. This work first describes the kinetics of the chemical hydrolysis of <b>imazosulfuron,</b> a new sulfonylurea herbicide, and evaluates the results to propose a degradation pathway. The hydrolysis of <b>imazosulfuron</b> has been studied in aqueous buffers both within the pH range 1. 9 − 12. 3 at ambient temperature (thermostated at 25 ± 2 °C) and at pH 3. 6 within the temperature range of 15 − 55 °C. The hydrolysis rate of <b>imazosulfuron</b> was characterized by a first-order kinetics, pH- and temperature-dependent, and accelerated by acidic conditions and higher temperatures. The calculated half-lives at pH 4. 5 and 5. 9 were 36. 5 and 578 days, respectively. At pH 6. 6, 7. 4, 9. 2, and 12. 3 no significant change in <b>imazosulfuron</b> concentration was observed after 150 days. Half-lives were much lower at pH < 4 (= <b>imazosulfuron</b> pKa), at which they ranged from 3. 3 to 6. 3 days. Moreover, a change in temperature from 15 to 25 °C in acidic conditions (pH 3. 6) decreased the half-life of <b>imazosulfuron</b> by a factor of 4. 0; in any case, a 3 − 5 -fold increase in the rate of hydrolysis was found for each 10 °C increase in temperature.

The degradation of <b>imazosulfuron</b> in a sandy loam soil (10 - 15 cm depth) has been investigated under aerobic and anaerobic laboratory conditions to evaluate its likely environmental fate. Test soils were treated with <b>imazosulfuron</b> in acetonitrile to give a final concentration of 0. 2 mg kg- 1 (100 g ha- 1). The treated soils were extracted with methylene chloride + acetonitrile + 1 M ammonium hydroxide (4 + 15 + 1 by volume) and analysed by HPLC. Recoveries from spiked soils ranged from 80 % to 95 % (RSD 0. 5 - 2. 5 %; n = 3) for <b>imazosulfuron</b> and its metabolites 2 -chloroimidazo[1, 2 -alpha]pyridin- 3 -sulfonamide (IPSN), 1 -(2 -chloroimidazo[1, 2 -alpha]pyridin- 3 -ylsulfonyl) - 3 -(4 -hydroxy- 6 - methoxypyrimidin- 2 -yl) urea (HMS) and 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dimethoxypyrimidine (ADPM). The limits of quantitation ranged from 0. 001 mg kg- 1 to 0. 005 mg kg- 1. Chemical cleavage of the sulfonylurea bond to give ADPM and IPSN was the main degradation pathway in aerobic conditions, whereas a remarkable production of HMS under anaerobic conditions suggested that degradation was due to micro-organisms which {{had the ability to}} demethylate <b>imazosulfuron.</b> In aerobic and anaerobic conditions, <b>imazosulfuron</b> disappeared from the soil with a half-life of approximately 70 (90 % CL 62 - 75; r 2 = 0. 98) and 4 (90 % CL 3. 2 - 4. 2; r 2 = 0. 97) days, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the fate of bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) and <b>imazosulfuron</b> (IMS) under paddy conditions. Initially, laboratory experiments {{were conducted}} and the photolysis half-lives of the two herbicides {{were found to be}} much shorter than their hydrolysis half-lives in aqueous solutions. In the aerobic water–soil system, dissipation followed first-order kinetics with water half-lives of 9. 1 and 11. 0 days and soil half-lives of 12. 4 and 18. 5 days (first phase) and 35. 0 and 44. 1 days (second phase) for bensulfuron-methyl and <b>imazosulfuron,</b> respectively. However, the anaerobic soil half-lives were only 12. 7 and 9. 8 days for BSM and IMS, respectively. The values of K d were determined to be 16. 0 and 13. 8 for BSM and IMS, respectively. Subsequent field measurements for the two herbicides revealed that dissipation of both herbicides in paddy water involved biphasic first-order kinetics, with the dissipation rates in the first phase being much faster than those in the second phase. The dissipation of bensulfuron-methyl and <b>imazosulfuron</b> in the paddy surface soil were also followed biphasic first-order kinetics. These results were then used as input parameters for the PCPF- 1 model to simulate the fate and transport of BSM and IMS in the paddy environment (water and 1 -cm surface soil layer).

30|$|Methodological {{uncertainties}} come {{primarily from}} the procedures for removing the extractable residues to obtain the matrix containing only NER. Taking the paper from Barriuso et al. [11], the amounts of NER of pesticides vary strongly depending on the extraction procedures, with the largest variations of a factor up to 10. To give few examples: the amounts of NER of <b>imazosulfuron</b> vary between 19 and 68 % of the applied radioactivity, that of propoxycarbazone between 6 and 65 %, of propiconazole between 4 and 48 %. Another methodological uncertainty is the extraction procedures for investigation of NER (silylation for type I and type II NER differentiation and acidic hydrolysis for bioNER quantification): {{it is likely that}} silylation extracts and residues besides xenobiotic residues also contain bioNER, especially for compounds that are readily biodegraded. Therefore, type I non-extractable residues need to be investigated to address this uncertainty, but a method for analytical differentiation needs to be developed. Chemical analysis of type II NER, which are strongly bound and not releasable under physiological, natural conditions, is, however, not possible, i.e., the uncertainty of the apportionment of xenobiotic and biogenic residues in these fraction cannot be settled.|$|E

A bioassay, on the basis of the injury index to vegetable seedlings, showed that both field mustard and Chinese mustard were more sensitive to bensulfuron, <b>imazosulfuron,</b> and pyrazosulfuron than lettuce and cabbage in winter. In a similar study, field mustard was found to be the most sensitive species among six summer vegetables. After foliar application of bensulfuron at 0. 487 mu M, 2 -aba accumulation reached the maximum in field mustard within 6 to 12 h, before any visible symptoms appeared, and this high level was maintained up to 72 h. Among all vegetables tested for differential SU sensitivities, maximum accumulation of 2 -aba occurred, in coincidence with the onset of injury, in field mustard. The accumulation of 2 -aba in field mustard showed a linear regression to the log-transformed concentrations, ranging from 10 (- 2) to 10 (2) mu M, of each of the three SUs. However, no such relationship between the applied rate, especially at the lower rates, and the residue content of SUs in field mustard plant was found.

40|$|Aerobic rice {{systems can}} {{substitute}} the conventional rice cultivation {{system in the}} wake of water shortage and energy crises. The major constraint in the success of aerobic rice is high weed infestation. Hence, we have discussed the weed flora, yield losses, herbicide-resistant weeds, need for integrated weed management, and approaches to manage weeds in aerobic rice systems. A review of several studies indicated that 90 weed species were competing with rice under aerobic systems, causing 23 - 100 % reductions in grain yield. Weed control in aerobic rice gets difficult due to shifts in weed flora and herbicide resistance development in weeds. A wide increase in grain yield (15 - 307 %) by implementing different weed control practices elaborates the scope of weed management in aerobic rice. Practices, such as soil solarization, sowing of competitive crop cultivars, stale seedbed preparation, mulch application, correct fertilization, and intercropping, were found to have particular significance for managing weeds in aerobic rice systems. Moreover, hand weeding and mechanical control were more effective when combined with other weed control methods. Herbicides, such as pendimethalin, 2, 4 -D, penoxsulam, ethoxysulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, triclopyr, <b>imazosulfuron,</b> bensulfuron, pretilachlor, and metsulfuron, were found most effective in aerobic rice systems. Keeping in view the severity of weed infestation in these systems and the evolution of herbicide resistance, reliance on a single control method is out of question.

The amendment of soil with compost may significantly influence the mobility and persistence of pesticides and thus affect their environmental fate. Factors like adsorption, kinetics, and rate of degradation of pesticides could be altered in amended soils. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of the addition of compost made from source-separated municipal waste and green waste, on the fate of triasulfuron [(2 -(2 -chloroethoxy) -N-[[4 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) amino] carbonyl]benzenesulfonamide], a sulfonylurea herbicide used in postemergence treatment of cereals. Two native soils with low organic matter content were used. A series of analyses was performed to evaluate the adsorption and degradation of the herbicide in soil and in solution after the addition of compost and compost-extracted organic fractions, namely humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (HoDOM). Results have shown that the adsorption of triasulfuron to soil increases in the presence of compost, and that the HA and HoDOM fractions are mainly responsible for this increase. Hydrophobic dissolved organic matter applied to the soils underwent sorption reactions with the soils, and in the sorbed state, served to increase the adsorption capacity of the soil for triasulfuron. The rate of hydrolysis of triasulfuron in solution was significantly higher at acidic pH and the presence of organic matter fractions extracted from compost also slightly increased the rate of hydrolysis. The rate of degradation in amended and nonamended soils is explained by a two-stage degradation kinetics. During the initial phase, although triasulfuron degradation was rapid with a half-life of approximately 30 d, the presence of compost and HoDOM was found to slightly reduce the rate of degradation with respect to that in nonamended soil. peer-reviewe...|$|E

In addition, herbicide programs were evaluated for cost of production, gross return, net return, and net return relative to MeBr in LDPE–mulched tomato and bell pepper production. Allyl ITC and metam sodium did not injure tomato. Weed control and yield in tomato plots treated with allyl ITC at 750 kg ha - 1 or metam sodium at 360 kg ha- 1 were comparable to plots treated with MeBr at 390 kg ha- 1.

Herbicide programs consisting of PRE–applied S–metolachlor followed by (fb) POST–applied trifloxysulfuron plus halosulfuron provided comparable weed control to MeBr in LDPE–mulched tomato and bell pepper. Tomato or bell pepper plots treated with the S–metolachlor–containing herbicide program yielded total marketable fruits equivalent to the plots treated with MeBr.
