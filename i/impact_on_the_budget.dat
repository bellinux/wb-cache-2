50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{estimates}} that enacting H.R. 3008 {{would have a}} negligible <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> The bill would authorize the exchange of 5 acres {{of land in the}} Los Padres National Forest for unspecified lands owned by the White Lotus Foundation.

However, because of the modest amount of money involved, CBO did not expect this change {{to have a significant}} net <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> in any given year. For purposes of its estimates, CBO assumed that the requirement to transfer funds would apply only to amounts collected after the bill's enactment and that existing balances would remain available to TSA for aviation security.|$|E
5000|$|As of November 2014, {{there was}} no major {{legislation}} scheduled to expire or take effect projected by CBO to have a material net <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> deficit.

CBO estimated allowing those laws to take effect would have dramatically reduced the deficit over a decade, but also would have slowed the economy and increased unemployment {{at a time when the}} economy was recovering from the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger {{proposed}} to [...] "eliminate and transfer the functions" [...] of OEHHA (and other agencies) as part his May Revise for the 2009-2010 budget. [...] Details about {{the transfer of}} functions including mandates, funding, staff resources, and new head agency are limited. Elimination of OEHHA {{will have a very}} minor <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> problems because of several reasons: (1) OEHHA's budget is very small (1/500th of 1% of the General Fund, or 1/50,000th) compared to the state deficit; $8.3 million of OEHHA's budget is general fund (2) about half of OEHHA's budget is funded by special funds (e.g. Proposition 65, Biomonitoring) (3) state mandates that transfer to other agencies or departments will still require funding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} setting the debt ceiling is {{separate}} and distinct from the regular process of financing government operations, and raising the debt ceiling {{does not have any}} direct <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> deficit. The US government passes a federal budget every year. This budget details projected tax collections and outlays and, therefore, the amount of borrowing the government would have to do in that fiscal year. A vote to increase the debt ceiling is, therefore, usually seen as a formality, needed to continue spending that has already been approved previously by the Congress and the President. The Government Accountability Office explains: [...] "The debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred." [...] The apparent redundancy of the debt ceiling has led to suggestions that it should be abolished altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{fees are}} {{not a part of}} the Interim Strategy; therefore, under title V, the NPS would collect fewer fees. However, CBO {{estimates}} that the net <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of that change would not be significant. [...] Title VI, Green Mountain LookoutFormerly [...] Title VI would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in Washington state unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. Based on information provided by the Forest Service, CBO estimates that implementing title VI would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. [...] In 2012, a federal court ordered the Forest Service to remove a lookout structure from Green Mountain, located in the wilderness area. Under title VI, the agency would be authorized to remove the structure only if it poses a risk to public safety. Because the lookout was recently reconstructed, CBO expects that, under title VI, the agency would allow the structure to remain on the mountain for several years. As a result, CBO estimates, the Forest Service would not need to spend about $200,000 in appropriated funds to remove the structure; the amounts required to maintain the structure over the next five years would be minimal. [...] Title VII, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National ParksFormerly [...] Title VII would nullify within three years of enactment existing regulations prohibiting hand-propelled vessels on streams and rivers in the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Title VII also would direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to coordinate the use of hand-propelled vessels on the Gros Ventre River within the National Elk Refuge in Wyoming. Under existing regulations, the National Park Service prohibits boating on five of the 168 lakes in Yellowstone National Park and a 1,000-foot section of the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park. Based on information provided by the Department of the Interior, CBO estimates that implementing title VII would cost about $4 million over the 2014-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds to conduct resource studies, promulgate new rules, and manage boating in the newly opened areas. [...] Title VIII, Federal Grazing LandsFormerly [...] Title VIII would increase the term of new grazing permits on federal lands from 10 years to 20 years and allow expired and transferred grazing permits to remain in effect until new permits are issued by BLM or the Forest Service. Based on information provided by the affected agencies, CBO estimates that enacting that provision would have a minimal impact on offsetting receipts each year because those agencies have the authority under current law to extend expired permits. The bill would allow the affected agencies to collect offsetting receipts from transferred permits sooner than it would under current law.|$|E

30|$|Fiscal {{conditions}} are controlled for {{by means of}} the general government budget balance. The expectation is that, in the case of reforms that are costly to the budget, a larger fiscal space favours reforms. The spread with respect to Germany of real interest rates on 10 year government bonds is also included as a measure of markets’ perception of fiscal conditions 11. The expected effect of such a variable is not obvious. On the one hand, higher spreads may signal stronger market pressure to reform. On the other hand, they are associated with a reduced fiscal space to accommodate reforms with an <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> Another hypothesis that has often been put to the test is that fiscal consolidation makes reforms less likely by reducing the political capital available to governments. We have not pursued that route as, in our sample, fiscal consolidation measures raise a strong suspicion of endogeneity, especially with reform measures with an <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> but also with those reforms that were triggered during the crisis in a context of capital flight, revenue losses linked to deep recessions, and bond market tensions, where governments had to respond simultaneously by tightening the budget and stepping up the reform agenda.|$|E
