5|$|The {{chemically}} resistant (but expensive) fluorinated ionomers {{are used as}} electrochemical cell membranes, of which {{the first and most}} prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based chloralkali process cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are crosslinked <b>fluoropolymer</b> mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest <b>fluoropolymer</b> and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey <b>fluoropolymer</b> paint.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fluoropolymers</b> {{share the}} {{properties}} of fluorocarbons {{in that they are}} not as susceptible to the van der Waals force as hydrocarbons. This contributes to their non-stick and friction reducing properties. Also, they are stable due to the stability multiple carbon-fluorine bonds add to a chemical compound. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> may be mechanically characterized as thermosets or thermoplastics. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> can be homopolymers or Copolymer.|$|R
5|$|About 180,000metrictons of <b>fluoropolymers</b> were {{produced}} in 2006 and 2007, generating over $3.5billion revenue per year.

40|$|Metals and <b>fluoropolymers</b> {{exposed to}} 0. 5 to 1. 0 keV argon ions at current densities of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mA/sq cm develop surface {{texturing}} that increases tensile and shear strength of epoxy bonds. Bonds are 46 to 100 percent stronger {{than those of}} chemically etched surfaces. Metals require 3 to 4 hours of bombardment to become properly textured. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> require 5 seconds to 30 minutes. Ion beam will not texture nickel. Unlike chemical treatments, bonding of <b>fluoropolymers</b> can be done days or months after ion treatment...|$|R
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's <b>fluoropolymer</b> production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

40|$|An {{electron}} bombardment argon ion source {{was used to}} ion etch various metals and <b>fluoropolymers.</b> The metal and <b>fluoropolymers</b> were exposed to (0. 5 to 1. 0) keV Ar ions at ion current densities of (0. 2 to 1. 5) mA/sq cm for various exposure times.
