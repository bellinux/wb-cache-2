In his closing remarks, the President of the Russian Federation expressed his opinion: [...] "There is indeed, a distinct lack of sign language translators. This level of need necessitates changes. There are considerations and proposals for implementation to resolve the need of training sign language interpreters to provide translation services. But <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> has been said: it is necessary to reconsider the preparation of the interpreters at the Ministry of Education Institutions and universities. These teachers should be prepared in virtually every federal district, because we have a huge country and it is impossible to imagine having all sign language interpreters trained in Moscow, for example, and {{this is the only way}} we can solve this problem. I am glad that the State Duma supported the initiatives of the President, so we will continue to work in the same unity, in which we have previously worked to resolve this issue." ...|$|E

March 14 supporters stressed how his predecessor had very different views and was almost fanatically supportive of the Lebanese Forces. Christian {{supporters of}} the March 8 alliance welcomed his comments. Prime Minister Najib Mikati also supported his stance saying [...] "The Maronite patriarch spoke about a part the problem. No one is against the resistance’s arms as long as Israeli occupation continues. There is Lebanese unanimity on the resistance’s arms in the face of Israeli occupation." [...] Mikati said after his meeting with al-Rahi that he was [...] "very relieved and reassured by the Patriarch’s wisdom." [...] President Michel Suleiman said that [...] "the Patriarch is not in need of anyone to defend him and his positions emanate from his central role as a person in charge of Lebanon's and the Middle East's Christians and that of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty;" [...] and that [...] "the patriarch {{does not need to be}} defended, and his stances represent his way of taking responsibility for Lebanon's Christians."

Here is the picture of Iraq in front of us." [...] Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun expressed support for al-Rahi: [...] "Rai’s statements express the concerns of the minorities because he is entrusted with the Synod for the Middle East. Gradual changes doesn’t harm stability and wouldn’t get Syria into the same troubles as Palestine, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. some of the Syrian demonstrators are armed and are destroying the country the Syrian government cannot but bring order to the country." [...] Former 14 March Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt also criticised Rai's assessment on the grounds that [...] "Lebanon cannot remain hostage to regional conflicts", and denied that regime change in Syria was posing a threat to Christians in the country. In an interview with Reuters on 4 March 2012, al-Rahi said: [...] "All regimes in the Arab world have Islam as a state religion, except for Syria.

40|$|Brian Forst and Shawn Bushway {{have done}} an {{excellent}} job of bringing together perspectives from various disciplines on discretion in criminal sentencing. That itself is a great service, and there is much that <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with.</b> <b>What</b> I will attempt to do in my comments is to continue building a more complete picture of the role discretion plays {{in the criminal justice system}} from my own slightly different disciplinary perspective of law and economics. First, I will fill out some of the picture of theoretical economic work provided by the authors. The most important theoretical contributions by economists in the area of crime have been on the costs and benefits of incarceration. However, to my knowledge none of that work has incorporated judicial discretion, prosecutorial discretion, or sentencing guidelines even though they are of obvious relevance to deterrence and incapacitation. I argue that we have learned some important lessons on sentencing from theoretical work, but that more work can be done because prior forays do not adequately reflect the institutional picture. Second, I will discuss briefly the challenge of reducing and measuring “unwarranted disparity ” in sentencing. Reducing disparity was an important goal of the state and federal Guidelines, and there are substantial challenges to actually identifying the magnitude of unwarranted disparity and the success of the Guidelines in mitigating it...|$|E
