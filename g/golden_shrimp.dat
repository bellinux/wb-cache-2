50|$|Farfantepenaeus aztecus is {{a species}} of marine penaeid shrimps found around {{the east coast of}} the USA and Mexico. They are an {{important}} commercial species in the USA. The FAO refers to them as the northern brown shrimp; other common names, used in the USA, are brown shrimp, <b>golden</b> <b>shrimp,</b> red shrimp or redtail shrimp.|$|E
50|$|Pachystachys lutea, {{known by}} the common names {{lollipop}} plant and <b>golden</b> <b>shrimp</b> plant, is a subtropical, soft-stemmed evergreen shrub between 36 and 48 inches (90 and 120 cm) tall. The zygomorphic, long-throated, short-lived white flowers emerge sequentially from overlapping bright yellow bracts on racemes that are produced throughout the warm months. It is a popular landscape plant in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.|$|E

40|$|China is {{a country}} with longest history of {{aquaculture}} in the world. Comparatively, shrimp culture {{is a relatively new}} industry in China. The earliest national production figure of cultured shrimp was 79 metric tons in 1970. It took more than 10 years for the production to reach 10, 000 metric tons. The cultured shrimp production reached 10, 093 metric tons in 1981. In 1981 - 1988, China experienced the first <b>golden</b> period of <b>shrimp</b> culture industry development after the full maturation of mass production hatchery technique for shrimp (P. chinensis). The total production of cultured shrimp unbelievably increased to 199, 418 metric tons in 1988 from 10, 093 metric tons in 1981. However, the good times did not last long. The peak production maintained for 5 years only, ending in 1992 with production of 206, 866 metric tons. The serious outbreak of shrimp diseases badly hit China along with other shrimp producers in Asia. This resulted to the drop of cultured shrimp production to 87, 856 mt in 1993, 40 % of the highest production in 1991 (219, 571 mt). The production continued to drop to 63, 872 metric tons in 1994. The industry started to recover very slowly in the next 3 years, and regained its production of more than 100, 000 tons in 1997 (102, 923 mt). The slow recovery in cultured shrimp production in 1995 - 1998 was mainly due to modification in the culture system and techniques. Since 1998, China has been into a new era of fast growth in cultured shrimp production. The production has been keeping a very fast growth, from 143, 086 mt in 1998 to 760, 430 mt in 2003. The rapid growth of production during the last several years was mainly due to the rapid expansion of culture of Penaeus vannamei, an exotic shrimp species. Cultured shrimp production in China during 1984 - 2003. It {{should be noted that the}} increase of cultured shrimp production was very abrupt in 2003 in China. It appears unbelievable. Two major reasons could be attributed to it in addition to the expansion of shrimp farming in China in 2003. One is due to the unreported freshwater production of P. vannamei before 2003. It was estimated that production of cultured P. vannamei in freshwater environment reached 160, 000 metric tons in China in 2002. This production was not actually included in the total cultured shrimp production of the year. Secondly, it was only in 2003 when brackish and freshwater production of P. vannamei was separately reported...|$|R
30|$|With the {{participation}} of outsiders who have enough capital {{to invest in the}} risky business, consequent landlessness is often considered as a negative result of the shrimp industry (Luttrell 2006; EJF p. 26; EJF 2003; Le Thi Van Hue and Scott p. 17; Le Thi Van Hue and Scott 2008, p. 70, Pham Van Khang 2008, p. 45 - 47). However, outsider participation in shrimp farming is not always an issue. In the two research in Long An and Ca Mau provinces, where extensive and advanced-extensive types of shrimp culture are widely adopted, shrimp farmers are mostly local people who had previously cultivated rice. During the <b>golden</b> age of <b>shrimp</b> farming, land values in these localities increased. Outsiders who had capital and knowledge of raising shrimp (mainly aquaculture engineers) came to these sites to invest in shrimp farming. However, it was not easy for them to purchase land in these communities because most local landowners were reluctant to give up their land entirely due to their historical and cultural ties to the land. Therefore, those coming from elsewhere to invest in shrimp aquaculture had to rent ponds to raise shrimp. Often after several unprofitable crops, they then had to quit. In contrast to other studies, which claim landlessness as a negative impact of shrimp farming (EJF 2003; Luttrell 2006; Le Thi Van Hue and Scott, 2008), this study shows that landlessness due to shrimp farming has not been a widely common phenomenon in shrimp farming communities, especially in those places where farmers adopt extensive and semi-extensive types of shrimp culture. To farmers, land is an economically and culturally valuable asset. Selling off their land is the last resort for farmers. During hard times, they resort to many strategies to keep their land. For example, at the beginning stage of shrimp farming, when the poor could not engage in shrimp farming, they either, rented their land out to others and took their land back when they could afford shrimp farming, or left their fields vacant while engaging in off-farm jobs to earn their living. In shrimp production, although incurring bad debt is a pervasive phenomenon, selling land, the only valuable asset of most farmers, to pay off their debt is not always the case. In the case that they cannot pay back loans or debts resulting from shrimp farming, they normally pledge their land (cấm cố) to their local neighbors who will give them some money (in gold equivalence) to use that plot of land until the land owners are able to pay them back that same amount of money (in gold equivalence with no interest charged). Failing shrimp farmers either migrate to other places to find jobs or rent back that same piece of land to raise shrimp in order to accumulate money {{to be able to get}} their land back. My study also shows that although loans from government banks with favorable interest are the most important source of capital that help people to take part in shrimp farming, other informal types of support from relatives, neighbors (in the form of cash, labor, and land) and people within the shrimp market network (buying food or shrimp post-larvae on credit) are also important, especially to the poor.|$|R
