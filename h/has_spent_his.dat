Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E
25|$|Capello {{was born}} in San Canzian d'Isonzo near Gorizia, in {{north-eastern}} Italy, {{in what was then}} the Allied-occupied Zone A of the Julian March. His parents were Guerrino and Evelina Capello. Capello is a devout Catholic who prays twice a day.

Capello <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> entire adult life working in football. He has been married to his wife Laura, whom he first met on a bus as a teenager, for over 40 years. He is represented by his son Pier Filippo, who acts as his agent. In January 2008, Italian police announced that they were launching an investigation into tax irregularities by Capello. The probe, however, has been dismissed as routine by Capello's spokesmen, who said this was part of a wider investigation into a number of wealthy Italians. The FA revealed that they had known about the upcoming probe when they had appointed Capello, and expected no charges to be brought.|$|E
500|$|On 27 December 2002, an {{open letter}} {{announced}} {{the revival of the}} Priory of Sion as an integral traditionalist esoteric society, which stated that: [...] "The Commanderies of Saint-Denis, Millau, Geneva and Barcelona are fully operative.

500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the {{historical}} figure of the same name, is Bolívar's [...] "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's [...] "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has learned to live with his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, [...] Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Final Fantasy XII, Vaan is a 17-year-old {{orphaned}} street urchin {{who lost his}} parents in a plague when he was 12 years old. His only brother, Reks, died two {{years prior to the}} start of the game, during the Archadian invasion of Dalmasca. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers while claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic boy. Vaan dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He trains to meet this goal by killing dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname [...] "Vaan Ratsbane." [...] Despite nominally being the protagonist, the majority of the game focuses on the events and conflicts of the world as a whole and of Ashe, rather than Vaan's individual problems, with his character instead used as a narrative device to allow the player to follow the events as an outside observer. During the course of the game, Vaan comes to understand that he <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>his</b> time running from his problems and blaming the Archadian empire for them, rather than moving on with his life after his brother and parents' deaths. Vaan ends the game as a sky pirate, traveling the world along with Penelo. He also reprises his role from Final Fantasy XII in the manga adaptation by Gin Amou.|$|E
