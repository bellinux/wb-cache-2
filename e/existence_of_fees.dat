40|$|Nowadays, most loan {{transactions}} are contracted {{by using the}} exponential discounting as the underlying standard economic model to value this type of financial operations. In a framework of absence of fees to be paid by the borrower, the interest rate of the exponential discount function is, moreover, the true interest rate of the operation. Nevertheless, there exist a set of circumstances which make this identity false. Among others, these characteristics are: the use of linear discount as the underlying discount function, splitting time when using a nominal interest rate, and the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> in a loan at 0 % interest rate. All these cases will be analyzed in this paper {{in the context of}} the so-called quick loans...|$|E

This has been highlighted with the commencement of the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profit Commission in 2012 heralding a new era of accountability and regulation. It is in this context that this study used a stratified sample of 101 Australian charities’ 2011 - 2012 annual reports to study five aspects of the charity audit market, which formed its objectives. These were: a) to estimate and develop a model <b>of</b> Australian charity <b>fee</b> audit determinants; b) to determine if there was evidence of Big Four audit firm fee premiums in a market where the Big Four may not dominate; c) to test for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> audit <b>fee</b> premium pricing amongst non-Big Four audit firms; d) to test for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> an audit <b>fee</b> premium for audit firm offices; and e) to test for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> an audit <b>fee</b> premium for audit firm partners. This study found support for the choice of audit firm (Big Four audit firm versus non-Big Four audit firm) having an influence on audit fee pricing. Auditee complexity, a well-established determinant in the private sector literature, was also shown to have some influence on charities’ audit fee costs, in the form of incorporation (company versus non-company) and size as represented by proxy, income being significant. Trading income too indicated a possible influence on charities’ audit fees, but these findings were limited and require further investigation. In this study a Big Four audit premium was shown to exist in the Australian charity sector. It is also shown that small audit firms with a single client may have been discounting audit fees, but further investigation is required to confirm this. In summary, this study put the spotlight on a sector that has not previously been examined, and provides deeper insights into the Australian charity sector and audit fee pricing...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory Fees at Children´s Department in Klatovy Hospital The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} effects and impacts after an introduction <b>of</b> regulatory <b>fees</b> {{in the health}} service. An aim of the thesis was to ascertain effects of the introduction <b>of</b> regulatory <b>fees</b> at Children´s Department in Klatovy Hospital. First I investigated how the fees influenced an exploitation of the hospital care, and then I investigated whether the fees influenced a possibility of parents to accompany their children during the hospitalization. In the theoretical part I deal with basic definitions of terms related to the issue <b>of</b> regulatory <b>fees.</b> These include concepts of a health, an illness, a health policy, health systems, a structure of the health system in the Czech Republic and a definition <b>of</b> the regulatory <b>fees,</b> their types, an importance of their introduction, a protection limit, effects of the introduction and a consumption of the health services after the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>fees.</b> In the practical part I attend to a description of objectives and hypotheses, a research methodology and an interpretation of results. The research part was realized by using a quantitative form of the research, I used a method of interviewing, a questionnaire technique. As an auxiliary method I chose a document analysis { [...] } secondary data analysis. The research sample consisted of the parents accompanying their children for an examination at an outpatient clinic and parents accompanying hospitalized children. The research results showed that regulatory fees do not influence the possibility of parents to accompany their children during the hospitalization and although parents say that in case of repeated hospitalizations the fees could influence this possibility, they continue to accompany their children during their hospitalization and on the contrary, there is {{an increasing number of}} the accompanying.

40|$|Using unique {{data from}} Pakistan we {{estimate}} {{a model of}} demand for differentiated products in 112 rural education markets with significant choice among public and private schools. Our model accounts for the endogeneity <b>of</b> school <b>fees</b> and the characteristics of students attending the school. As expected, central determinants of school choice are the distance to school, school fees, and the characteristics of peers. Families {{are willing to pay}} on average between 75 % and 115 % of the average annual private school fee for a 500 meter reduction in distance. In contrast, price elasticities are low: - 0. 5 for girls and - 0. 2 for boys. Both distance and price elasticities are consistent with other estimates in the literature, but at odds with a belief among policy makers that school fees deter enrollment and participation in private schooling. Using the estimates from the demand model we show that the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a low <b>fee</b> private school market is of great value for households in our sample, reaching about 25 % to 100 % of monthly per capita income for those choosing private schools. A voucher policy that reduces the <b>fees</b> <b>of</b> private schools to $ 0 (from an average annual <b>fee</b> <b>of</b> $ 13) increases private school enrollment by 7. 5 percentage points for girls and 4. 2 percentage points for boys.
