25|$|The first {{computer}} keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial <b>keyboard</b> <b>cable</b> communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the <b>keyboard</b> <b>cable</b> or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E

50|$|The kits were {{a perfect}} vehicle to sell Maplin's {{components}} and {{the articles in}} Electronics published full circuit diagrams, parts lists and technical articles with full instructions for building and setting up the projects. All this happened in the early 1980s, and the sudden boom in home computer ownership spawned by manufacturers such as Sinclair, Commodore International and Atari created opportunities for Maplin to create home build project kits to plug into these computers such as speech synthesisers, memory expansion cards, extension <b>keyboards,</b> <b>cables,</b> and connectors.|$|R
5000|$|The term interdiction is {{also used}} by the NSA when an {{electronics}} shipment is secretly intercepted by an intelligence service (domestic or foreign) {{for the purpose of}} implanting bugs before they reach their destination. According to Der Spiegel, the NSA's TAO group is able to divert shipping deliveries to its own [...] "secret workshops" [...] in a method called interdiction, where agents load malware onto the electronics or install malicious hardware that can give US intelligence agencies remote access. The report also indicates that the NSA, in collaboration with the CIA and FBI, routinely and secretly intercepts shipping deliveries for laptops or other computer accessories, such as a computer monitor or <b>keyboard</b> <b>cables</b> with hidden wireless transmitters bugs built-in for eavesdropping on video and keylogging.|$|R

50|$|Like all early optical mice, {{their debut}} product {{relied on a}} special {{metallic}} and reflective mousepad printed with a square grid of grey and blue tracking lines: as the device moved over the pad, LED feedback was processed by an on-board microchip, which in turn supplied the host computer with machine-readable tracking data via an RS-232 serial port. An external power supply was required. Some mice would derive their power supply from the keyboard connector on the motherboard and came with a pass-through connector to be inserted before the <b>keyboard</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Matra Alice 90 {{released}} in 1985 was an upgrade to the Alice 32, which featured 32 kilobytes of RAM and a full-size case and <b>keyboard.</b> Its video <b>cable</b> included video-in, so EF9345 graphics could be overlaid onto the input video.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{hardware}} {{covers all}} of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, <b>cables,</b> <b>keyboards,</b> printers and [...] "mice" [...] input devices are all hardware.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} major {{redesign}} of the Apple keyboard, featuring more fluid, curving lines to match the look of the new Apple product style. It was an unpopular replacement for the Apple Extended Keyboard II in 1994. Significantly lighter than its predecessors, it had a much softer and quieter key interface that was unpopular with many typists. It also included only one ADB port for mice or other pointing devices, concealed on the underside, with the keyboard's cable permanently attached. The Extended II had an ADB port {{on either side of the}} keyboard, allowing the <b>keyboard</b> <b>cable</b> or mouse to be attached to the side preferred by the user. This keyboard was also produced in black using the same model number (like the Apple Keyboard II before it), for inclusion with the Macintosh TV, black Performa 5420 released primarily in Europe, and the black Power Macintosh 5500 released in Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Keyboard hardware: Hardware keyloggers {{are used}} for {{keystroke}} logging {{by means of a}} hardware circuit that is attached somewhere in between the computer keyboard and the computer, typically inline with the <b>keyboard's</b> <b>cable</b> connector. There are also USB connectors based Hardware keyloggers as well as ones for Laptop computers (the Mini-PCI card plugs into the expansion slot of a laptop). More stealthy implementations can be installed or built into standard keyboards, so that no device is visible on the external cable. Both types log all keyboard activity to their internal memory, which can be subsequently accessed, for example, by typing in a secret key sequence. A hardware keylogger has an advantage over a software solution: it is not dependent on being installed on the target computer's operating system and therefore will not interfere with any program running on the target machine or be detected by any software. However its physical presence may be detected if, for example, it is installed outside the case as an inline device between the computer and the keyboard. Some of these implementations have the ability to be controlled and monitored remotely by means of a wireless communication standard.|$|R
5000|$|Marisol Macías {{was murdered}} for exposing {{criminal}} groups in Mexico through social media. While {{writing on the}} social media websites, she targeted the criminal groups around her area, namely the Los Zetas drug cartel who are predominantly found in north and northeast Mexico and even in Laredo, Texas. She was decapitated, with her head {{on top of a}} well-known stone monument, Christopher Columbus Monument, in a busy, well-traveled section of the city. Beheading is a standard way that the drug cartels have killed its enemies. The rest of her body, a <b>keyboard,</b> <b>cables,</b> and disks, as well as the hand written note, were together on the lawn close to the monument. The Zetas left a note next to her body which translated reads, [...] "OK Nuevo Laredo en Vivo and social media sites. I am Nena de Laredo and I'm here because of my (online) reports and yours.....For those who don't believe this happened to me because of my actions, for trusting in the Army and Marines...Thank you for your attention, La Nena de Laredo...ZZZZ." [...] It is still unknown how the criminal group discovered her identity on the social websites.|$|R

5000|$|The Portable was {{basically}} a PC/XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512 kB on the motherboard), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome amber composite monitor, {{and one or two}} half-height 5¼" [...] 360 kB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA card and a 9" [...] amber monochrome composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could, however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television. A separate 83-key <b>keyboard</b> and <b>cable</b> was provided.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{connecting}} a keyboard to a system unit (more precisely, to its <b>keyboard</b> controller) using <b>cables,</b> including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the PS/2 and the USB connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary Apple Desktop Bus for its keyboard connector.|$|R

40|$|This is chapter 77 in the The Handbook of Information Security, H. Bidgoli, ed., New York: Wiley, 2006. Electronic {{protection}} involves {{methods of}} preventing spies from stealing secrets from the electromagnetic emanations of your information systems, {{as well as}} methods of preventing saboteurs from incapacitating or destroying your information systems using electromagnetic radiation. We discuss the kinds of threats {{and what can be}} done to reduce or prevent them. Particular weaknesses are video monitors, <b>keyboards,</b> and <b>cables.</b> Electromagnetic shielding is helpful, but requires special additions to computer hardware. Source suppression, noise generation, encryption, deliberate irregularity, and deliberate deception can also help against spies but require careful planning. Bug detectors can alert you to electronic devices that may be eavesdropping, but do not always work. As for electromagnetic sabotage, similar shielding methods can protect against it, but backup methods are important, including current limiters...|$|R

2500|$|Kelly Jones and Stuart Cable {{lived on}} the same street in the Welsh village of Cwmaman. Jones heard Cable played drums so asked {{if he wanted to}} jam together. After some time practising in Jones' dad's garage, Nicholas Geek joined in on guitar. Later, Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and <b>keyboards,</b> respectively. <b>Cable</b> recalls {{he was the one who}} {{suggested}} that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported Roy Orbison. In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name [...] "Zephyr". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways. Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R band called [...] "Silent Runner" [...] while Cable joined a glam-rock band named [...] "King Catwalk" [...] on drums.|$|R
5000|$|The Miracle system {{consisted}} of a <b>keyboard,</b> connecting <b>cables,</b> power supply, soft foot pedals, and software either on 3.5" [...] floppies or standard, licensed NES/SNES/Genesis cartridges. After the supplied MIDI keyboard was connected to a console or computer and the included software was loaded, a user followed the on-screen notes. Its marketed value was {{as a tool to}} teach kids and to play the piano. It provided hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. Due to its high price (US$500) and low sales, the keyboard with all of the original cables together are a rare find. Factory sealed copies of the Sega Genesis version can be worth up to US$412. [...] Aside from being released in the United States, the Miracle Keyboard was also released in multiple regions within Europe. The European versions are, however, much harder to find. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were also later converted for PC use - the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.|$|R
40|$|The Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment (SHERE) is a {{proposed}} International Space Station (ISS) glovebox experiment designed {{to study the}} effect of preshear on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for monodisperse dilute polymer solutions. Collectively referred to as Boger fluids, these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment. The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, <b>Cabling,</b> <b>Keyboard,</b> Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray. Each component will be described in detail in this paper. In the area of space exploration, the development of in-situ fabrication and repair technology represents a critical element in evolution of autonomous exploration capability. SHERE has the capability to provide data for engineering design tools needed for polymer parts manufacturing systems to ensure their rheological properties have not been impacted in the variable gravity environment {{and this will be}} briefly addressed...|$|R
