5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Como {{was born}} in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was the seventh of ten {{children}} and the first American-born child of Pietro Como and Lucia Travaglini, who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump the bellows, and play music he had heard by ear. Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> barely afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como {{was a member of}} the Canonsburg Italian Band along with the father of singer Bobby Vinton, bandleader Stan Vinton, who was often a customer at his barber shop.|$|E
500|$|Upon his arrival, Goddard warned {{his client}} that a citizen's intervention, should it arise, {{was likely to}} succeed. It was, {{according}} to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition. Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform {{him that she was}} willing to give him up so that he could remain king. It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to go, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not marry Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: [...] " [...] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but {{the other end of the}} wicket [...] was determined".|$|E

500|$|On 13 May, {{near the}} village of Arakere, about [...] below Seringapatam, Tipu decided to offer battle from a {{position}} on nearby heights. [...] In the ensuing battle, complicated by the rains, Cornwallis prevailed, routing Tipu's forces, which retreated into Seringapatam. Following the battle, Cornwallis made the difficult decision to retreat, as the army's supply situation had become so desperate that a siege would have been impossible, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have joined with Abercromby's troops. A hoped-for junction with Marathan troops also seemed unlikely, as Tipu had successfully prevented communication and intelligence of their position from reaching Cornwallis, and the most recent reports placed them some distance off. [...] After ordering Abercromby to retreat on 21 May, Cornwallis ordered his siege train destroyed and began to retreat toward Bangalore on 26 May. [...] That very day, he was met by an advance company of the Marathan army. [...] The next day that army, totalling some 40,000 cavalry, joined with his. The Marathan army was well-provisioned, so they were able to relieve some of the British army's stresses, although the prices they charged for their provisions were exorbitant. [...] The combined army reached Bangalore on 11 July. Tipu took advantage of the retreat to make a concerted attack on Coimbatore, which fell after a lengthy siege in November.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records. Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134). He also held NL career marks in {{categories}} such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. [...] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military. [...] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. [...] His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. [...] He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. [...] His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road. [...] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191. [...] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. [...] His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) {{he would have had to}} play to age 47 to attain the hits record.|$|E
2500|$|Reporters {{liked him}} because he was always willing to talk to them on the record, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say much for it. He was the department's {{preferred}} spokesperson for what it called [...] "front-page crimes." [...] Of the department's senior commanders, the same detective who praised Seedman's style in the Times said, [...] "he only one who comes across on the tubeâ€”and in a media age you must have a guy like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frequently and {{accurately}} described as [...] "cigar-chomping" [...] and [...] "tough-talking", {{with a personal}} style likened by a colleague to a Jewish gangster, {{he was one of}} the city's most visible police personnel during the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s. Newspaper photographers and television cameras carried many images of, and quotes by, him. He was always willing to speak to reporters <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell them much. After his retirement he wrote Chief!, a memoir of his time on the force and high-profile cases, and appeared as a detective in the 1975 film Report to the Commissioner.|$|E
2500|$|The F-86 was {{vulnerable}} to the diminutive Folland Gnat, nicknamed [...] "Sabre Slayer." [...] The Gnat is credited by many independent and Indian sources as having shot down seven Pakistani Canadair Sabres in the 1965 war. while two Gnats were downed by PAF fighters. The PAF's F-104 Starfighter of the PAF was the fastest fighter operating in the subcontinent {{at that time and}} was often referred to as [...] "the pride of the PAF". However, according to Sajjad Haider, the F-104 did not deserve this reputation. Being [...] "a high level interceptor designed to neutralise Soviet strategic bombers in altitudes above 40,000 feet," [...] rather than engage in dogfights with agile fighters at low altitudes, it was [...] "unsuited to the tactical environment of the region." [...] In combat the Starfighter was not as effective as the IAF's far more agile, albeit much slower, Folland Gnat fighter. Yet it zoomed into an ongoing dogfight between Sabres and Gnats, at supersonic speed, successfully broke off the fight and caused the Gnats to egress. An IAF Gnat, piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, landed at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur and was captured by the Pakistan Army. The pilot claimed that most of his equipment failed and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get some chance on that, the Starfighters snuffed it. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, was of view that Gnat was no [...] "Sabre Slayer" [...] when it came to dog fighting. The Pakistan Air Force had fought well in countering the much large Indian Air Force and supported the ground forces.|$|E

Also he promised to bring them some clothes and cloaks of Spanish make, since those they had were not fit to travel in through that country, being soiled and blood-stained.|$|R
50|$|Judd {{is excited}} {{that he is}} going to see Vicki Byrne again. He has always felt that they should be more than friends. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> wonders <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get married, with only about a year before the return of Christ. But when they climb down a rock face, and Judd accidentally makes a boulder fall, it crushes Lionel's left arm. He is stuck. After he stops the bleeding, Judd starts to run back to the safe house for help, leaving Lionel to wait. Lionel knows that if help does not come soon, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die. After hours pass, and no help arrives, he takes matters into his own hands.|$|R
60|$|The {{humor of}} this proved {{too much for}} the three of us, and Miss Trevor herself went into peals of laughter. Would that the Celebrity could have seen his own face.

6000|$|... "Free!" [...] The word rang in {{her ears}} as she {{drove back to the}} little house that had been her home. The Honourable Dave lifted his felt hat as he handed her out of the carriage, and said he would call again in the <b>evening</b> to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} further for her.

5000|$|Back in 1885, {{after their}} Chicago {{team won the}} pennant, Kelly and McCormick {{returned}} by train to Paterson with teammate Tom Burns, who was heading to Connecticut. A local social club met the players and took them to McCormick's bar. There, a state senator handed a silver ball to McCormick, [...] "who was loudly called upon and cheered. He said {{he was suffering from}} the effects of a severe cold and he would like to make a speech but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell them how much he appreciated this token of friendship, more than anything he had ever yet received. Kelly was called on and was cheered; in fact, the crowd at this stage was prepared to cheer everybody. As he arose some one sic called: 'Make a dead hit this time, Mike!' He said on behalf of Mr. McCormick and himself he desired to thank the donors of the ball; they would never forget this occasion and would ever keep this gift and try to be in the best club sic; but we are getting pretty old now." ...|$|R
5000|$|He died at 95, and {{his funeral}} {{was held in}} Les Invalides. In tributes, the President of France, Jacques Chirac, called him [...] "one of the inventors of French sport". The prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said: [...] "France and journalism have just lost an {{exceptional}} man. He made the Tour de France, through his 50 years at its helm, the most popular French sports event and the one most known across the world". The former winner Laurent Fignon said: [...] "I only knew him a little. But what I remember of him is his personality. He had true moral values and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> sometimes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> appear hard, <b>he</b> was always just in his judgements".|$|R

50|$|It took Kai until November 2000 to {{make another}} final eight appearance. A third place at Grand Prix Florence was {{followed}} by his second Pro Tour win. The 2000 Pro Tour Chicago title made him the third player to win more than one Pro Tour, the other two being Jon Finkel and Tommi Hovi. Winning Pro Tour Barcelona in the same season, Kai managed to surpass Finkel and Hovi {{to become the first}} player to win three Pro Tours. In the semi-final at Barcelona Budde had <b>even</b> asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> concede to his friend Patrick Mello to make him eligible for the next Masters, but the officials had refused. Finally a 44th-place finish at the World Championship in Toronto sufficed to make Kai the first double Pro Player of the Year.|$|R
50|$|Maria Fitzherbert's {{face was}} one which always {{displayed}} its best advantages. Her eyes were peculiarly languishing, and, {{as she had}} already been twice a widow, and was six years his senior, she had the advantage over a less experienced lover. Likewise, she was a Catholic, and so by another act of Parliament any marriage with her would be illegal. Yet just because of all these different objections the prince was doubly drawn to her, and was willing to sacrifice <b>even</b> the throne <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but win her.|$|R
5000|$|Young people, {{especially}} if they were educated, were actively persecuted for practicing religion, and {{especially if}} they did so openly, or participated in Christian study groups or choirs. People {{who were part of}} such groups could be arrested and even placed in [...] "psychiatric prisons". Placing the religious youth in psychiatric hospitals was based on the principle that any person who had gone through the atheistic education from kindergarten to university and yet remained religious (or <b>even</b> worse, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> converted), <b>could</b> be considered to have a kind of psychological disorder.|$|R
6000|$|What hereto {{had been}} known to him alone, [...] Despite our long sit-out of years foreflown, [...] "And if," [...] I said, [...] "I do this for his memory's sake, [...] It would not wound him, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> wake." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dead silence {{followed}} this speech. The girls did some rapid-fire mental calculations {{and realized that}} this young man was proposing to invest something like fourteen hundred thousand dollars, in order that they might carry out their philanthropic conception.

6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} for him," [...] Grace said, [...] "but the poor old man will never reach Willow Lake on foot, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find the way.

60|$|It befell {{also that}} another wonder was worked, {{by no means}} {{inferior}} to the last. For among those who had believed in the saving name of the Lord Christ, an Ishmaelite, of no humble rank, had made a vow to God, with Simeon as witness. Now his promise was this, that he would henceforth to the end abstain from animal food. Transgressing this promise once, I know not how, he slew a bird, and dared to eat it. But God being minded to bring him by reproof to conversion, and to honour his servant, who was {{a witness to the}} broken vow, the flesh of the bird was changed into the nature of a stone, so that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wished, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not thenceforth eat it. For how <b>could</b> <b>he,</b> when the body meant for food had turned to stone? The barbarian, stupified by this unexpected sight, came with great haste to the holy man, bringing to the light the sin which he had hidden, and proclaimed his transgression to all, begging pardon from God, and invoking the help of the saint, that by his all-powerful prayers he might loose him from the bonds of his sin. Now many saw that miracle, and felt that the part of the bird about the breast consisted of bone and stone.|$|R
6000|$|Time {{was when}} an incompetent Governor {{could not be}} {{permitted}} among men. He was, and had to be, by one method or the other, clutched up from his place {{at the helm of}} affairs, and hurled down into the hold, perhaps <b>even</b> overboard, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not really steer. And we call those ages barbarous, because they shuddered to see a Phantasm at the helm of their affairs; an eyeless Pilot with constitutional spectacles, steering by the ear mainly? And we have changed all that; no-government is now the best; and a tailor's foreman, who gives no trouble, is preferable to any other for governing? My friends, such truly is the current idea; but you dreadfully mistake yourselves, and the fact is not such. The fact, now beginning to disclose itself again in distressed Needlewomen, famishing Connaughts, revolting Colonies, and a general rapid advance towards Social Ruin, remains really what it always was, and will so remain! ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the whole}} {{it was a}} {{peaceful}} and grateful retrospect; the brothers all doing so well in their several ways, and such a comfort to their father. Tom, concerning whom she had made the greatest mistake, might be looked upon as rescued by Norman. Aubrey, Margaret said, smiling, was Ethel's child, and had long been off her mind; Hector, to her quite a brother, would miss her almost more than her own brothers, but good honest fellow, he had a home here; and, whispered Margaret, smiling and glowing a little, [...] "don't tell any one, for it is a secret of secrets. Hector told me one <b>evening</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be very steady, he hoped he might yet have Blanche at Maplewood. Poor little White Mayflower, it won't be for want of liking on her part, and she so blushes and watches when Hector comes near, that I sometimes think {{that he might have}} said something like it to her." ...|$|R
