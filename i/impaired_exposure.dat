30|$|Despite {{the claim}} that use of uterine {{cannulation}} is not necessary [30] and that it may led to dissemination of tumoral cells [43, 44], {{there is no evidence}} that uterine manipulation during laparoscopy increases the risk of cell spillage in the pelvic cavity [27, 28, 45]. To date, the prognostic importance of isolated positive cytology remains uncertain [46]. In fact, the new FIGO staging system deleted cytology as a variable dictating more advanced disease [35]. In this study, the rate of positive cytology and vaginal recurrence was comparable with those reported in previous studies in which patients were treated by laparotomy [47] or those in which TLH was performed without uterine cannulation [48]. Moreover, several studies comparing laparotomy with laparoscopy have shown that the rate of positive cytology was identical between the groups [41] even if the uterus was cannulated [24, 27]. Furthermore, in our experience, the uterine manipulator is essential to improve exposure and prevent ureteral complications [37].

We investigated whether MMF-treated renal transplant patients who concomitantly used pantoprazole as ulcer prophylaxis had a higher risk of acute rejection within the first three months after transplantation than those who used ranitidine. Methods: We performed a retrospective study in adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation between January 2007 and December 2011. Their immunosuppressive therapy consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and MMF and they used either pantoprazole or ranitidine as ulcer prophylaxis. Results: 202 patients were included: 125 using pantoprazole and 77 using ranitidine. There was no difference in the number of patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) : 13 (10. 4 %) in the pantoprazole group versus 7 (9. 1 %) in the ranitidine group (NS). Also after correction for inequalities between the two groups, there was no significant relationship between the risk of BPAR and the type of anti-ulcer agent.

The natural bioburden of used surgical devices is 10 0 to 10 3 organisms (primarily vegetative bacteria), which is substantially below the 10 5 - 10 6 spores used with biological indicators. Spore-forming organisms are most resistant to sterilization and are the test organisms required for FDA clearance.

40|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} is a major {{biomedical}} health concern in the United States. Despite considerable research efforts aimed at understanding the progression of the disease, the specific mechanisms leading to alcohol-induced damage remain elusive. Numerous proteins {{are known to have}} alcohol-induced alterations in their dynamics. Defining these defects in protein trafficking is an active area of research. In general, two trafficking pathways are affected: transport of newly synthesized secretory or membrane glycoproteins from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane and clathrin-mediated endocytosis from the sinusoidal surface. Both impaired secretion and internalization require ethanol metabolism and are likely mediated by acetaldehyde. Although the mechanisms by which ethanol <b>exposure</b> <b>impairs</b> protein trafficking are not fully understood, recent work implicates alcohol-induced modifications on tubulin or components of the clathrin machinery as potential mediators. Furthermore, the physiological ramifications of impaired protein trafficking are not fully understood.

40|$|AbstractThe {{prefrontal cortex}} (PFC) {{provides}} top-down regulation of behavior, cognition, and emotion, including spatial working memory. However, these PFC abilities are greatly <b>impaired</b> by <b>exposure</b> to acute or chronic stress. Chronic stress exposure in rats induces atrophy of PFC dendrites and spines that correlates with working memory impairment. As similar PFC grey matter loss appears {{to occur in}} mental illness, the mechanisms underlying these changes need to be better understood. Acute stress <b>exposure</b> <b>impairs</b> PFC cognition by activating feedforward cAMP-calcium- K+ channel signaling, which weakens synaptic inputs and reduces PFC neuronal firing. Spine loss with chronic stress {{has been shown to}} involve calcium-protein kinase C signaling, but it is not known if inhibiting cAMP signaling would similarly prevent the atrophy induced by repeated stress. The current study examined whether inhibiting cAMP signaling through alpha- 2 A-adrenoceptor stimulation with chronic guanfacine treatment would protect PFC spines and working memory performance during chronic stress exposure. Guanfacine was selected due to 1) its established effects on cAMP signaling at post-synaptic alpha- 2 A receptors on spines in PFC, and 2) its increasing clinical use for the treatment of pediatric stress disorders. Daily guanfacine treatment compared to vehicle control was found to prevent dendritic spine loss in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of prelimbic PFC in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress. Guanfacine also protected working memory performance; cognitive performance correlated with dendritic spine density. These findings suggest that chronic guanfacine use may have clinical utility by protecting PFC gray matter from the detrimental effects of stress...|$|R

The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly <b>impaired</b> after <b>exposure</b> of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly <b>impaired</b> after <b>exposure</b> of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. In each experiment, column chromatography of the luminal aspirates revealed similar spectra of hydrolytic products of [14 C]PG- 7, whereas the fraction of the distal aspirate chromatogram appearing as pteroyl-micron[14 C]glutamyl-gamma-monoglutamate ([14 C]-PG- 1) was similar in all three groups. By accounting for the variable effects of absorption on the luminal appearance of [14 C]PG- 1 and by correcting for mucosal hydrolysis which was not followed by release of [14 C]PG- 1 to the luminal contents, the calculated rate of in vivo hydrolysis of [14 C]PG- 7 to [14 C]PG- 1 was found impaired in both celiac sprue groups, with significant improvement on treatment. In mucosal biopsies from the sprue patients, the in vitro activity of folate conjugase in whole homogenates was higher and the activity of disaccharidase lower than {{in a group of}} 12 normal mucosal biopsies. These in vitro data suggest that the predominant cellular location of mucosal folate conjugase is different from that of disaccharidase, whereas comparison with the results of in vivo hydrolysis suggests that measurement of the enzyme in whole mucosal homogenates overestimates its significant digestive activity. The present studies indicate that (a) the mucosal lesion of celiac sprue significantly limits the intestinal absorption of both simple and conjugated folate, and (b) malabsorption of conjugated folate results from a combination of impaired hydrolysis and decreased mucosal uptake of hydrolytic product...|$|R

We also investigated why predator <b>exposure</b> <b>impairs</b> memory. Was spatial memory impaired because of the fear-provoking aspects of predator exposure or only because the cat was a novel and arousing stimulus? If the latter possibility was correct, then any novel and arousing stimulus, independent of its emotional valence (i. e., aversive or appetitive), would impair memory. We found that spatial working memory was not impaired when the male rats were exposed to a sexually receptive female rat, a stimulus that was novel and arousing to them, but not aversive.

Overall, this series of experiments demonstrates that (1) predator stress selectively impaired working (hippocampal-dependent), but not reference (hippocampal-independent), memory; (2) a fear-provoking stimulus, and not merely novelty and increased arousal, impaired spatial memory; and (3) increased corticosterone levels correlated withimpaired spatial working memory only under predator exposure, that is, fear-provoking conditions...|$|R

Rats were orally exposed to 0 or 50 mg Mn/kg/day from postnatal day 1 until the end of the study (PND 145). The staircase test was used to assess skilled forelimb function. Oral MPH (2. 5 mg/kg/day) was administered daily 1 h before staircase testing for 16 days. DA and NE levels were measured by dual probe microdialysis. Results show that Mn <b>exposure</b> <b>impaired</b> reaching and grasping skills and the evoked release of DA and NE in the PFC and striatum of adult rats. Importantly, oral MPH treatment fully alleviated the fine motor deficits in the Mn-exposed animals, but did not affect forelimb skills of control rats not exposed to Mn. These results suggest that catecholaminergic hypofunctioning in the PFC and striatum may underlie the Mn-induced fine motor dysfunction, and that oral MPH pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment approach for alleviating this dysfunction in adult animals.

Fish exposed to oil prior to bacterial challenge exhibited 94. 4 % mortality within 48 hours of bacterial exposure. Flounder challenged with V. anguillarum without prior oil exposure had < 10 % mortality. Exposure resulted in taxonomically distinct gill and intestine bacterial communities.

Endogenous GP was tyrosine nitrated and irreversibly inactivated in skeletal muscle cells upon exposure to peroxynitrite, with concomitant impairment of glycogen mobilization.

The results showed that younger zebrafish exposed to no MeHg, EtOH, or 0. 01 mM of MeHg learned and retained avoidance responses, while 0. 1 or 0. 3 mM of MeHg <b>exposure</b> <b>impaired</b> avoidance learning in a dose-dependent manner. The study suggested that MeHg exposure produced learning impairments at a much lower concentration of MeHg exposure and more severely in older adult compared against younger adult zebrafish even after short exposure times...|$|R

However, the mechanisms by which PCBs disrupt the epididymis remain obscure. We analyzed the gene expression profile in mice epididymis exposed to PCBs (Aroclor 1254) at doses comparable to human exposure using a cDNA microarray. Differentially expressed genes were involved in a variety of function categories and biological pathways, including GTP binding, nucleosome assembly, and ribosome and protein disulfide isomerase. The differentially expressed genes related to GTP binding were highly enriched. The abundance of GTP binding proteins related to tight junctions being reduced and the phosphorylation level of their downstream effectors were <b>impaired</b> after <b>exposure</b> to PCBs. The results of tracer studies demonstrated that the permeability of blood-epididymis barrier was increased by PCB exposure. In addition, PCB exposure also disrupted the expression of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens- 1 and occludin. We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} exposure to PCBs at doses relevant for the general population was able to affect the blood-epididymis barrier in mice through altering GTP binding and tight junction proteins. Our results provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms linking PCB exposure to sperm maturation...|$|R
