Second-growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake.|$|E
5|$|In prehistoric times montane forest {{occupied}} {{one-third of}} the territory of present-day Rwanda. Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the three National Parks, with terraced agriculture dominating {{the rest of the}} country. Nyungwe, the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias. Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest. By contrast, Akagera has a savanna ecosystem in which acacia dominates the flora.

25|$|The long {{geological}} {{isolation of}} the Socotra archipelago and its fierce heat and drought have combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora. Botanical field surveys led by the Centre for Middle Eastern Plants, part of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, indicate that 307 out of the 825 (37%) plant species on Socotra are endemic, i.e., they are found nowhere else on Earth. The entire flora of the Socotra Archipelago has been assessed for the IUCN Red List, with 3 Critically Endangered and 27 <b>Endangered</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> recognised in 2004.|$|E

A colonial population of 570 cacti were found on one island in Biscayne Bay in 2001, making it the largest known population of semaphore prickly-pear cactus in the world. The only natural population of Sargent's palm grows on Elliott Key. Fewer than 50 grew on the key in 1991. Despite efforts to propagate the plant, there are now 16 Sargent's palms on Elliott Key, with about 123 propagated on Long Key.|$|E

Its black maple and upland sugar maple communities are host to many threatened and <b>endangered</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> and bloom with trillium, trout lilies, violets, buttercups, and wild geraniums in the spring. The forest is a refuge {{for a wide range of}} birds, including Great Horned Owls and several species of hawks, as well as a stopover for several species of migratory birds, including the Indigo Bunting, which nests there during the warm breeding season and migrates south by night in the winter.

2500|$|The Ogasawara Islands have no airport, {{and there}} is no {{prospect}} for one being constructed. However, for several decades there was talk of building one. Anijima and Chichijima were once designated possible construction sites, but because there are numerous valuable, rare, or <b>endangered</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> forming a unique ecosystem {{in the vicinity of the}} proposed sites, issues of nature conservation were raised. Although construction of an airport was desired by some, a desire to keep the natural beauty of the islands untouched created a movement to block it. The airport issue was quite controversial on the islands.|$|E
2500|$|Increasing {{agriculture}} {{and urban development}} is an increasing problem for Nelson's antelope squirrel. This species will not colonize cultivated land. [...] Therefore, an increase in agriculture land is taking away their habitat and leaving them with no alternative. [...] Grazing livestock further destroys what habitat may be left, and exotic plants are able to take over native grasses that the squirrel forages upon and relies on for shade and cover. [...] Also, pesticide drift from nearby agricultural fields encroaches in on the existing squirrel habitat. [...] Not only are these practices affecting {{the population of the}} Nelson's antelope squirrel, but they are also causing problems for other native animal and plant species in the San Joaquin Valley. [...] Native plant species such as the kern mallow, San Joaquin woolly threads, California jewelflower, and Bakersfield cactus are all federally <b>endangered</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that are being outcompeted by invasive plant species. [...] Many invasive plants grow in very dense patches. [...] These dense patches are not adequate habitats for Nelson's antelope squirrel and many other San Joaquin Valley Species.|$|E

The most serious is a bark beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus) and mistletoe (Arceuthobium sp.). The drought conditions have been blamed on global climate change. Areas in Querétaro and Guanajuato have been declared as biosphere reserves. The Sierra Gorda in Hidalgo has not, but it still contains a large number of important ecosystems.|$|E
