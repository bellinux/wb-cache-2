50|$|On {{his return}} from Ireland, he {{proposed}} himself {{as a candidate for}} Staffordshire in the 1698 election in place of the retiring John Grey. He solicited the support of Sir Walter Bagot, 3rd Baronet, who had sat for the county until 1695, and his son Edward, but this <b>forward</b> <b>proposal</b> (the Staffordshire gentry had historically met and chosen candidates by consensus, to avoid the cost of a contested election) backfired. Edward had his own designs on the seat, and he wrote to many of the local gentry to inform them of Shirley's breach of protocol, asking them not to pledge their support until a meeting could be held. As the other sitting member, Henry Paget, intended to retain his seat, local support began to coalesce around Paget and Bagot. Nonetheless, Robert's father, Lord Ferrers, and his kinsman Viscount Weymouth continued actively soliciting support for Shirley and Bagot; the support of Whigs such as Philip Foley for Paget in 1693 had made him somewhat suspect among the Tories. Lord Ferrers, though a Tory, obtained the interest of the Whig Dukes of Shrewsbury and Newcastle on Robert's behalf, suggesting a fluid political affiliation. In August 1698, {{on the eve of the}} election, John Chetwynd held a meeting between the Shirleys and the Bagots at Ingestre to try to broker a last-minute compromise, in which one of the candidates would withdraw in exchange for an unopposed candidature at the next election. The compromise failed, and the contest may have gone to a poll; if so, Shirley was unsuccessful, and Paget and Bagot were elected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With {{the depth}} {{development}} {{of health care}} system reform in China, emergency medical services (EMS) is confronted with challenges as well as opportunities. This study aimed to analyze the equity of China 2 ̆ 019 s EMS needs, utilization, and resources distribution, and put <b>forward</b> <b>proposal</b> to improve the equity. Method Three emergency needs indicators (mortality rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, harm, and digestive system disease), two utilization indicators (emergency outpatient visits and rate of utilization) and one resource allocation indicator (number of EMS facilities) were collected after {{the review of the}} China Statistical Yearbook and the National Disease Surveillance System. Next, EMS related indicators were compared among 31 provinces from the eastern, central, and western regions of the country. Concentration Index (CI) were used to measure the equity of EMS needs and utilization among the western, central, and eastern regions. The Gini coefficient of demographic and geographic distribution of facilities represented the equity of resource allocation. Result During 20102 ̆ 0132014, the CI of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease mortality changed from positive to negative, which indicates that the concentrated trend transferred from richer regions to the poorer area. Injury mortality (CI: range from 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2122 ̆ 0090. 1241 to 2 ̆ 2120. 1504) and digestive disease mortality (CI: range from 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2122 ̆ 0090. 1921 to 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2122 ̆ 0090. 2279) consistently concentrated in the poorer region, and the inequity among regions became more obviously year-by-year. The utilization of EMS (CI: range from 0. 1074 to 0. 0824) showed an improvement; however, the inequity reduced gradually. The EMS facilities distribution by population (Gini coefficient: range from 0. 0922 to 0. 1200) showed high equitability but the EMS facilities distribution by geography (Gini coefficient: range from 0. 0922 to 0. 1200) suggested a huge gap between regions because the Gini coefficients were greater than 0. 5 in the past 5 years. Conclusion There are some inequities of needs, utilization, and resource allocation in the China EMS. The government needs to stick to the principle of increasing investment in poorer regions, perfecting ambulance configuration and improving health workers 2 ̆ 019 professional skills to improve the equity and quality of EMS...|$|E
