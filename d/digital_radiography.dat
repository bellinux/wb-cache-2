25|$|In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube {{generates a}} beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are {{filtered}} through a device called an grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by <b>digital</b> <b>radiography</b> (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen. In <b>digital</b> <b>radiography</b> the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{data hiding}} is demonstrating {{every day that}} several {{applications}} can benefit from this technology: among these, medical data management. In particular, embedding the patient’s information into a medical image through data hiding could improve the level of security and confidentiality that {{is essential for the}} diffusion of medical information sys- tems. The design of a data hiding system for such an application has to take into account specific requirements, the most important are: high payload to reliably identifying a pa- tient; quality preservation of the watermarked image; robustness to content modification. According to this analysis, a comparison between different data hiding approaches is pre- sented, to evaluate the most suitable algorithms for embedding patient’s information into <b>digital</b> <b>radiographies.</b> In particular two algorithms based on statistical decision theory have been compared with schemes following the new approach of modelling data hiding as com- munication with side-information at the transmitter.

40|$|Introduction: X-rays are potent {{mutagenic}} agents {{capable of}} inducing both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. They act {{directly on the}} DNA molecule or indirectly through the formation of reactive compounds that interact with this molecule. In spite of their mutagenic potential, this kind of radiation is an important tool for diagnosis. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the genotoxic effects on oral mucosa during conventional and <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography.</b> Objectives: 1. To assess the nuclear abnormalities, mainly micronuclei in exfoliated buccal mucosal cells, before X-ray exposure and 10 days after exposure using conventional and <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography.</b> 2. Comparison of micronuclei count obtained during conventional and <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography.</b> Materials and Methods: One hundred healthy individuals were chosen who were free of all deleterious habits. Epithelial buccal cells were obtained with an exfoliative cytobrush immediately before exposure and 10 days after exposure. The smears were stained using Giemsa stain and analyzed under low-power and high-power microscope. Results: There was a significant difference in the mean values obtained pre- and post-exposure to conventional panoramic radiography, as the mean value of micronuclei before exposure was 0. 025 ± 0. 01 which increased to 0. 064 ± 0. 02 post-exposure. Similarly, there was a significant difference in the mean values obtained pre- and post-exposure to <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography,</b> as the mean value of micronuclei before exposure was 0. 022 ± 0. 01 which increased to 0. 041 ± 0. 01 post-exposure. In the present study, there was a highly significant increase in the number of micronuclei post-exposure in conventional panoramic radiography when compared to <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography.</b> Conclusion: This results show that panoramic radiography does induce genotoxic effects in buccal epithelial cells and should be used only when indicated, and that <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography</b> is safer as compared to conventional radiography...|$|R

Materials and Methods Thirty-five patients under high-risk for development of carotid artery calcifications who had <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography</b> were referred to undergo ultrasonography. Thus, 70 arteries were assessed by both methods. The main parameters utilized to evaluate the panoramic radiography reliability in the diagnosis of carotid artery calcifications were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of this method as compared with ultrasonography.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess and}} compare five {{diagnostic}} imaging methods {{used in the}} identification of periapical diseases, of different diameters, mechanically simulated. MethodsThe sample of the present study consisted of 12 dried human mandibles. <b>Digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography,</b> conventional and <b>digital</b> periapical <b>radiography</b> (charged couple device and photo-stimulable phosphor plate), and high-resolution cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were previously performed to exclude regions presenting periapical lesions or similar conditions, which then formed the control and experimental groups. Then, periapical diseases were progressively produced with drills of different diameters, thus creating lesions of different sizes. The different image diagnosis methods were applied after each lesion produced. The data were assessed using the Kappa test, ROC curve graphs and Cochran's Q test. The significance level was set at 0. 05. ResultsThe images obtained with conventional film and <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography</b> showed the worse results (0. 65 and 0. 55, respectively), and statistically significant differences compared to the controls (p< 0. 05) for lesions artificially produced with # 6 drill. With regard to high-resolution CBCT, the area values were found to be high for all lesion sizes. ConclusionConventional periapical <b>radiography</b> and <b>digital</b> panoramic <b>radiography</b> did not provide satisfactory images for the identification of incipient periapical diseases. The high-resolution CBCT showed high accuracy in the diagnosis of periapical diseases in both regions evaluated, and proved to be the most reliable method for the identification of initial periapical diseases (1. 8 mm) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Foreign body {{ingestion}} {{is common}} and potentially lethal. This study evaluates {{the use of}} low-dose Statscans (LODOX) in emergency departments. DESIGN: This comparative cross-sectional study retrospectively assessed 28   289 digital chest x-rays and 2301 LODOX scans performed between 2006 and 2010 at a tertiary emergency centre. The radiographic appearance, image quality and location of ingested foreign bodies were evaluated in standard digital chest and LODOX radiography. The mean irradiation (μSv) and cumulative mean radiation dose per patient with the ingested foreign body were calculated according to literature-based data, together with the sensitivity and specificity for each modality. RESULTS: A total of 62 foreign bodies were detected in 39 patients, of whom 19 were investigated with LODOX and 20 with conventional <b>digital</b> chest <b>radiography.</b> Thirty-three foreign bodies were located in the two upper abdominal quadrants, 21 in the lower quadrants-which are not visible on conventional digital chest radiography-seven in the oesophagus {{and one in the}} bronchial system. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>digital</b> chest <b>radiography</b> were 44. 4 % and 94. 1 %, respectively, and for the LODOX Statscan 90 % and 100 %, respectively.

Cytological preparations were stained according to the Feulgen/fast green method and analyzed under a light microscope.
