Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger {{with his bare hands}} and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E

After an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to rob a local bank, he tries to kidnap Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra)Barfi's autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her grandfather's fortunefor a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi finds she has already been kidnapped. He sees her in a van, sneaks inside and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom delivery.

Occasionally he creates trees with multiple faces, usually three, which cover diverse themes. For example, a tree can have a scene depicting the birth of Christ, the Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Another example is the courtship, marriage and death of a couple. To decorate the trees, fine brushes and paints made himself from natural pigments are generally used. The final piece receives a coat of glue-based varnish. Attention is paid to the details.|$|E

25|$|Many critics hold postmodern art {{emerges from}} modern art. Suggested dates for {{the shift from}} modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe, and 1962 or 1968 in America. James Elkins, commenting on discussions about the exact date of the {{transition}} from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of Mannerism and whether it should begin directly after the High Renaissance or later in the century. <b>He</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> point these debates go {{on all the time}} with respect to art movements and periods, {{which is not to say}} they are not important. The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated to the end of the 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} large icons between the doors. These were {{probably}} painted by Mátyás Hittner, since their style slightly {{differs from the}} icons above. The paintings of the Sovereign follow the traditional placement. On the northern side of the iconostasis is the icon of Saint Nicholas. In Hajdúdorog he is depicted in an episcopal vestment. <b>He</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> gesture of teaching or blessing with his right hand, and he holds a crosier and a white handkerchief in his left. The icon of the Theotokos {{is on the left}} of the Royal Door. It is a traditional depiction of mother Mary holding her child in her arms. The child Jesus holds a blue orb in his left representing his rule above both our world and the others. His right hand makes the same gesture as Saint Nicholas. The icon {{on the other side of}} the Royal Door is that of the Pantocrator, which is a specific depiction of Christ. The Pantocrator, like the Theotokos icon, holds an orb in his left and makes the teaching gesture with his right. An open book lies before him, probably the New Testament based on the traditional depiction.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} formal {{education}} at the Barmen Gymnasium. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the University of Jena, intending to write a thesis in physics. But he also studied carefully Kant's Critique of Pure Reason during a course taught by Bruno Bauch, {{and was one of}} very few students to attend Gottlob Frege's courses in mathematical logic. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to World War I, he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the University of Berlin, 1917–18, where Albert Einstein was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the University of Jena, where he wrote a thesis defining an axiomatic theory of space and time. The physics department said it was too philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox Kantian style, and published as Der Raum ("Space") in a supplemental issue of Kant-Studien (1922). In it <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> clear distinction between formal, physical and perceptual (e.g., visual) spaces.|$|E
25|$|The two icons {{on either}} side of the Royal Doors are rather similar: Jesus was painted with an orb in his left hand, and <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> same gesture with his right in both pictures. However, the icon of the Theotokos {{represents}} Jesus' first appearance among humans, while the Pantocrator icon refers to his second coming. Thus the royal gate– and with that the most important movements of the holy service– is situated between the first and the second coming of Jesus. There is another interesting relationship between the two paintings. In Byzantine iconography Mary and Jesus usually wear blue or white garments covered by a red toga. After the death of Christ the colors are inverted. This change appears on the Theotokos and the Pantocrator icons: Mary wears a white tunic with a red toga; the Pantocrator on the other side wears a red garment with a blue toga. The Virgin also wears a blue on red garment on the top of the iconostasis, when mourning her son's death. In Christian art, the combination of blue and red has further significance: red refers to the divine origin and blue symbolizes human nature. This is the reason Christian art so often depicts Jesus in red and blue garments.|$|E
