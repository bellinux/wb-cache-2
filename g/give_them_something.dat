His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the Vietnam War. To <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics. O'Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: [...] "Is the surface of a planet really the right place for an expanding technological civilization?" [...] His students' research convinced him that the answer was no.|$|E

500|$|According to Ratnam, {{the only}} {{difference}} between Divya and Mouna Ragam was the scene with Karthik (which {{was not part of the}} earlier screenplay). Divya, the story of a young woman settling into an arranged marriage, did not explore her life before the marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> that would make them accept the character without questioning Divya's actions. The story dealt with an arranged marriage— two strangers suddenly thrown together— and how they adjust. Ratnam originally resisted this, but reconsidered because its suddenness provided a clear rationale for the Divya's resistance to the arranged marriage. Karthik said he was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the cast; his scenes were shot in a week, and his role was [...] "but a cameo".|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

[...] Stephen Whitty gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that Home would rather keep young viewers occupied than <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> to think about." [...] Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I realized that I had to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E

Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed VA-11 HALL-A as [...] "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and [...] "powerful" [...] writing.|$|E
2500|$|Blending {{literary}} elements {{is always}} a difficult task; Aphra Behn took on the challenge with Oroonoko. Restoration literature had three common elements: the New World setting, courtly romance, {{and the concept of}} heroic tragedy. John Dryden, a prominent playwright in 1663, co-wrote The Indian Queen and wrote the sequel The Indian Emperour. Both plays have the three aspects of Restoration literature, and [...] "Behn was certainly familiar with both plays", influencing her writing as seen in the opening of the tale. Behn takes the Restoration themes and recreates them, bringing originality. One reason Behn may have changed the elements is because Oroonoko was written {{near the end of the}} Restoration period. Readers were aware of the theme, so Behn wanted to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>something</b> fresh. Behn changed the New World setting, creating one that readers were unfamiliar with. Challenging her literary abilities even further, Behn recreates the Old World setting. Behn gives readers an exotic world, filling their heads with descriptive details. Behn was the first person to blend new elements with the old Restoration essentials. The New World was set in the contemporary British Caribbean, not in Mexico as previous centuries were accustomed to. With a new setting came a new villain, the British and their practice of Colonialism. The New World gave readers knowledge of a foreign place, “a colony in America called Surinam, in the West Indies”. Behn paints a picture-perfect New World unspoiled by natives—one that contrasts with Dryden's previous work. Unlike Dryden, she does not blame cruelty on distant tyrant leaders; instead, she places the blame on Colonialism. Behn's New World seems almost utopian as she describes how the people get along: “with these People, … we live in perfect Tranquility, and good Understanding, as it behooves us to do.” This New World is unique during this period; it is [...] "simultaneously a marvelous prelapsarian paradise and the thoroughly commercialised crossroads of international trade”. It seems hard to believe that in such a romantic setting Behn can blend heroic tragedy, yet she accomplishes this effect through the character of Oroonoko. The Old World changes as Behn recreates the trade route back across the Atlantic to Africa, instead of Europe, becoming “the first European author who attempted to render the life lived by sub-Saharan African characters on their own continent.” There were few accounts of coastal African kingdoms at that time. Oroonoko is truly an original play blending three important elements in completely original ways, with her vision of the New World constituting a strong example of the change.|$|E
