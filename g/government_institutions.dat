5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and <b>Government</b> <b>institutions,</b> and his one-man domineering leadership style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet leadership also believed that his individualistic leadership style ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new leadership. Together they formed a functional collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important <b>government</b> <b>institutions.</b> Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E
40|$|Zakat Potential in Indonesia is in {{fact the}} biggest zakat {{potential}} in the whole world. The potential of zakat in Indonesia is 217 billiom rupiah (BAZNAS, 2011). But the realization of zakat collection in Indonesia did not reach 2 percent of the whole potential. According to BAZNAS report, zakat collection in 2014 on a national level only reached 3, 2 billion rupiah. This indicates a very high discrepancy between zakat potential and zakat collection’s realization in Indonesia. In order to help zakat institutions in Indonesia maximizing the existing zakat potential, the government release Instruksi Presiden (Inpres) No. 3 year 2014 which was dedicated to all of <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions</b> as well as their employees to pay their zakat through the national amil institution, BAZNAS. The Inpres also indicates that BAZNAS must made a socialiszation regarding the importance of zakat and the Inpres itself to all of <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions.</b> BAZNAS was also asked to create somekind of strategy or mechanism to collect all zakat from the government’s instituions in an effective manner. Hence {{the purpose of the study}} is to help BAZNAS formulating a strategy to implement the law by analizing the internal factors as well as the external factors of BAZNAS in regards to the Inpres. Internal factor evaluation indicates that the strongest strengths of BAZNAS to implement the Inpres are BAZNAS’s distribution programs and also the transparancy as well as the accountability of BAZNAS’s financial performance. Other factors that also considered as the streghts of BAZNAS to implement the law are BAZNAS’s prominent figure who has wide network in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> BAZNAS’s zakat collection model, and BAZNAS’s cooperation with many institutions in the country and abroad. Whereas the weakest weaknesses of BAZNAS in implementing the law are the lack of uniformity of zakat understanding among the amilin in BAZNAS, as well as the quality of IT based system in BAZNAS’s branches. Eksternal factor evaluation indicates that among the opportunities that BAZNAS could take are the change of governmental cabinet, the growth of middle class Muslim in Indonesia, relationship with other zakat institutions, prominent figure who supports amil institution, and the increase of syraiah ambiance in the country. Whereas the threats that BAZNAS faces in regards to the Inpres implementation are bureaucracy in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> IT based system in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> low understanding of zakat amongst public in general, people’s trust towards <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> and muzakki that have their own network in distributing their zakat. The result of analyzing both internal and eksternal factors had positioned BAZNAS at the average pack of zakat institution. It is then being analyzed by using SWOT matrix to create alternate strategies. The result of SWOT Matrix are 9 alternate strategies which are the maximization of the role of BAZNAS prominent figure to expand the network in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> to strengthen the cooperation with other organizations to provide more facilities to the muzakki in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> to increase the amount of human resources and improve their capabilities, to develop IT based system in BAZNAS branches, to approach the new governmental cabinet, to strengthen cooperation in order to create zakat campaign in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> maximization of BAZNAS prominent figure to tackle the bureaucracy in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> to increase socialiszation in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> and to collect zakat in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions</b> through payroll system. This study aims to formulate a zakat collection strategy for BAZNAS through the stages of analysis mentioned before. Lastly the final stage of BAZNAS’s strategy formulation is analyzed using QSPM analysis in order to give a clear direction for BAZNAS to implement the new regulation in an effective manner. All of the o alternate strategies that have been identified earlier then being measured its’ attractiveness scores towards existing internal and external factors. Alternate strategies that have the highest total attractiveness score is the strategy that has to be prioritized by BAZNAS. Among the 3 highest alternate strategies based on QSPM analysis are to collect zakat in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions</b> through payroll system, to maximize the role of BAZNAS’s prominent figures in order to tackle the bureaucracy in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> and lastly to increase socialiszation in <b>government’s</b> <b>institutions</b> Keywords: BAZNAS, Strategy, SWOT, QSPM, Zakat Collectio...|$|R

Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
