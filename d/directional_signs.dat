25|$|Guide {{signs are}} divided into <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> service area signs, route markers, and tourist-related signs, with {{influence}} from both American and Australian practice. <b>Directional</b> <b>signs</b> use a green background with white letters and arrows. Service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. Tourist-related signs use a brown background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. The route marker sign, excluding the AH26 route marker, {{is based on the}} Australian National Route marker, but reserved for future use.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> is based upon, {{and is very}} similar to, that {{employed}} in the United Kingdom, but is bilingual everywhere except in the Gaeltacht, where only the Irish language is used on signs.|$|E

25|$|Class 2 (high intensity) is {{generally}} a microprismatic product which uses truncated cube corners to return {{light to the}} driver. It is commonly used for <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> or less important regulatory signs. There are also high intensity glass bead products that meet this class.|$|E
25|$|Directional signage {{is similar}} to current United Kingdom standards. The same colours are used for <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> in Ireland as in the UK, and the UK Transport and Motorway fonts are used. Unlike Wales and Scotland, where Welsh and Gaelic place-names use the upright Transport face, Irish place-names are {{rendered}} in an italic face.|$|E
25|$|They {{often do}} not appear on lesser roads, but are {{normally}} posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least 1000m from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> typically follow before the actual interchange itself.|$|E

25|$|Road {{signs in}} the Netherlands follow the Vienna Convention. <b>Directional</b> <b>signs</b> (which have not been {{harmonized}} under the Convention) always use blue as the background colour. The destinations on the sign are printed in white. If the destination is not a town (but an area within town or {{some other kind of}} attraction), that destination will be printed in black on a separate white background within the otherwise blue sign.|$|E
25|$|Diversion routes {{are marked}} with black symbols on a yellow patch (square, triangle, circle, or diamond). These mark diversionary routes {{in the event}} that the road ahead is closed for any reasons. Motorists can {{navigate}} following the symbol, and can find their way back to the original road at a junction above the closure. The four symbols may be filled (solid) or outlines. They are most commonly placed on <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> following the route number (e.g. A 25) but may be free standing.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands always signposts European road numbers where {{applicable}} (i.e., on the advance <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> the interchange direction signs {{and on the}} reassurance signs). Dutch national road numbers are placed on a rectangle, with motorways being signposted in white on a red rectangle (as an Axx) and primary roads in black on a yellow rectangle (as Nxx). When a motorway changes to a primary road, its number remains the same, but the A is replaced by the N. So {{at a certain point}} the A2 becomes N2, and when it changes to a motorway again, it becomes A2 again.|$|E

25|$|On Advance Direction Signs, as {{introduced}} {{under the}} Guildford Rules, the background colour indicates {{the category of}} route on which it is located. On all <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> destination names are placed on the colour appropriate to the category of route used from that junction. A panel of one colour on a different colour of background therefore indicates a change of route status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured blue or green.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} of the current signage system, introduced in 1977, {{can also be seen}} in on some national roads (and also on the oldest stretch of the M1). This is similar to the current system, but the signs are simpler, a different shade of green is used, and the Irish place names are not in italics. These signs were directly based on the Worboys Committee designs which had been adopted in the UK in 1965. These signs were replaced by the current system on 1 January 1989. The design of signs has continued to evolve with the introduction of patching under the Guildford Rules in 1994 and the introduction of cantilever <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> in 2005, as well as the expansion in gantry signage since then.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, the Australian National Route Numbering System was {{introduced}} to simplify navigation across Australia. The National Route Numbers are marked by white shields that are present in <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> distance signs or trailblazers. The general rule was that odd-numbered highways travel in north-south directions and even-numbered highways in east-west directions, {{with only a few}} exceptions. National Route 1 was assigned to a network of highways and roads, which together linked all capital cities and coastal towns circumnavigating the mainland. The National Route system initially linked the centres of towns and cities and terminated at the junction of other national routes, however many bypasses have been constructed since then. National Routes often terminated at the metropolitan city limits rather than the individual city centres.|$|E

25|$|Several other differences, {{including}} in road classification and route-numbering, speed-limits, directional sign-posting and warning and regulatory signposting have developed since the 1920s. Signs in Northern Ireland denote distances in miles, while all <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> {{placed in the}} Republic since the 1970s use kilometres. Currently speed limits in miles per hour (mph) are used north of the border; those in the Republic are in kilometres per hour (km/h). Metric speed limits were introduced on 20 January 2005, this involved the provision of 58,000 new metric speed limit signs, replacing 35,000 imperial signs. The Republic's road signs are bilingual, using both of the state's official languages, Irish and English while those in Northern Ireland are in English only. Northern Ireland uses directional, regulatory and warning signage which is almost identical to that used in Great Britain. Warning signs have black symbols on a white background with a red border, enclosed in a triangle-shaped sign. However, from 1956, the Republic of Ireland has used diamond-shaped warning signs, with black symbols or writing on a yellow (reddish-orange for temporary signs) background, similar to the signs used in the US and Australia.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{ordinance}} imposed content-based restrictions on free speech, Justice Thomas held that {{the ordinance}} would only be constitutional if it survived strict scrutiny. Assuming that the town's interests of preserving aesthetic appeal and traffic safety were compelling, he concluded that these were [...] "hopelessly underinclusive" [...] because the ordinance allowed for the proliferation of an unlimited number of larger, ideological signs that pose the same threats to aesthetics and traffic as <b>directional</b> <b>signs.</b> In fact, Justice Thomas suggested that a [...] "sharply worded" [...] ideological sign {{may be more likely}} to distract drivers than a directional sign. Justice Thomas also suggested that some <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> [...] "may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety". Therefore, Justice Thomas remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court's opinion.|$|E
500|$|The church {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona in March 2008, where they claimed the town [...] "abridged their freedom of speech in {{violation}} of the First and Fourteenth Amendments". The district court first denied the church's request for a preliminary injunction, and the church then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the likelihood of success on the merits requirement for a preliminary injunction, affirmed the decision of the district court, holding that the town's restrictions for temporary <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> [...] "did not regulate speech on the basis of content" [...] Although the Ninth Circuit conceded that enforcement officers would need to read a sign to determine which portions of the sign ordinance applied to the sign, the Ninth Circuit concluded that this [...] "cursory examination" [...] was not equivalent to [...] "synthesizing the expressive content of the sign". The Ninth Circuit then remanded the case back to the district court to determine [...] "in the first instance whether the Sign Code’s distinctions among temporary <b>directional</b> <b>signs,</b> political signs, and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a content-based regulation of speech." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{the town}} of Gilbert, Arizona adopted a {{municipal}} sign ordinance that regulated {{the manner in which}} signs could be displayed in public areas. Although the ordinance banned the display of most outdoor signs without a permit, twenty three categories of signs were exempt from the permit requirement. Three of those categories were relevant to this case. First, [...] "ideological signs", which contained [...] "a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes", could be up to twenty square feet in size and could be placed in any [...] "zoning district" [...] for any length of time. Second, [...] "political signs", which included content [...] "designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body", could be no larger than thirty two square feet on nonresidential property and sixteen square feet on residential property. Additionally, political signs could only be displayed [...] "up to 60 days before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election". Third, “temporary <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> relating to a qualifying event", which directed [...] "pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby" [...] to events hosted by non-profit organizations, could be no larger than six square feet. Additionally, temporary <b>directional</b> <b>signs</b> relating to a qualifying event could be displayed no earlier than twelve hours before the start of a qualifying event and no later than one hour {{after the end of the}} event; these signs could only be displayed in private property or public rights-of-way, but no more than four signs could be placed on a single property at the same time.|$|E

[...] After running through {{the southern part of}} downtown, it crosses the Mississippi on the Keokuk–Hamilton Bridge, which is adjacent to the older Keokuk Rail Bridge. From both bridges, Lock and Dam No. 19 and its hydroelectric power plant dominate the northern view of the river.|$|E
