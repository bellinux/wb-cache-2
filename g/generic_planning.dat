50|$|The first {{reasoning}} {{systems were}} theorem provers, systems that represent axioms and statements in First Order Logic {{and then use}} rules of logic such as modus ponens to infer new statements. Another early type of reasoning system were general problem solvers. These were systems such as the General Problem Solver designed by Newell and Simon. General problem solvers attempted to provide a <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> engine that could represent and solve structured problems. They worked by decomposing problems into smaller more manageable sub-problems, solving each sub-problem and assembling the partial answers into one final answer. Another example general problem solver was the SOAR family of systems.|$|E

To support this complex task, the development of planning tools is important to support people during decision-making and problem-solving tasks. Nowadays, {{a large number of}} manual and electronic tools support this complex activity; manual and electronic planning tools aid people in creating strategies for effective work performance. However, there is limited information on the design of <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> tools people use for their activities, and why people choose to use the planning tool they do. Some examples of generic tools for planning are calendars, checklists, agendas, etc. ^ To answer this question, this research study identifies and understands user preferences in the selection of these types of planning tools, particularly when users can choose manual or electronic planning tools. Principles of design, such as affordance, are considered in this study to generate insight on users 2 ̆ 7 preferences between manual and electronic <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> tools.

40|$|Healthcare service providers, {{including}} {{those involved in}} renal disease management, {{are concerned about the}} planning of their patients’ treatments. With efforts to automate the planning process, shortcomings are apparent due to the following reasons: (1) current plan representations or ontologies are too fine grained, and (2) current planning systems are often static. To address these issues, we introduce a planning system called Dynamic Personalized Planner (DP Planner) which consists of: (1) a suitably light-weight and <b>generic</b> <b>plan</b> representation, and (2) a constraint-based dynamic planning engine. The plan representation is based on existing plan ontologies, and developed in XML. With the available plans, the planning engine focuses on personalizing pre-existing (or <b>generic)</b> <b>plans</b> that can be dynamically changed as the condition of the patient changes over time. To illustrate our dynamic personalized planning approach, we present an example in renal disease management. In a comparative study, we observed that the resulting DP Planner possesses features that rival that of other planning systems, in particular that of Asgaard and O-Plan...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{general-purpose}} method for dynamically factoring a planning domain, whose structure is then exploited by our <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> method to find sound and complete plans.

The factorization procedure divides a planning domain into subdomains that are organized in a tree structure such that interaction between neighboring subdomains in the tree is minimized. The combined planning algorithm is sound and complete, and we demonstrate it on a representative planning domain. The algorithm appears to scale to very large problems regardless of the black box planner used. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Most {{approaches}} to dialogue management {{have so far}} concentrated on offline optimisation techniques, where a dialogue policy is precomputed for all pos-sible situations and then plugged into the dialogue system. This development strat-egy has however some limitations in terms of domain scalability and adaptivity, since these policies are essentially static and cannot readily accommodate runtime changes in the environment or task dynamics. In this paper, we follow an alternative approach based on online planning. To ensure that the planning algorithm remains tractable over longer horizons, the presented method relies on probabilistic models expressed via probabilistic rules that capture the internal structure of the domain using high-level representations. We describe in this paper the <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> al-gorithm, ongoing implementation efforts and directions for future work. ...|$|E
40|$|The meta level notion {{has been}} applied to dierent contexts. In this paper we present its {{application}} to an interoperable system. The incorporated meta level mechanism permits to improve the management of the system by: 1. allowing to exploit the existing mapping information and, 2. enhancing the query processing task through the use of query patterns. Mapping information is the abstraction that provides the link between the terms that appear in the semantic view (class level) oered to the user of the interoperable system and the instances of these terms actually supported by stored data (instance level) in distributed and heterogeneous data sources. Our mechanism allows one to describe mapping expressions and reasoning with them. Query patterns are associated to already obtained <b>generic</b> <b>plans.</b> Our mechanism recognizes a user query (description in the class level) as an instance of a query pattern (description in the metaclass level). Then, a proper instantiation of the correspondent <b>generic</b> <b>plan</b> solves the plan generation step of the query processing task. Dealing with a meta level, one aspect that requires a particular attention is the kind of language selected to specify metaclasses. This paper presents a logic-based language that allows the specication of structural and semantic constraints of objects that belong to the class level. Our proposal is founded on the Description Logics (DL) technology. We have dened a DL with two combined languages: one to specify the schema part in the metaclass level, and another for the view part. The description of semantic constraints on class level objects is achieved by the integration of suitable predicates of Concrete domains into the DL language.

40|$|Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) {{has proven}} to be a powerful, <b>generic</b> <b>planning</b> {{technique}} for decision-making in single-agent and adversarial environments. The stochastic nature of the Monte-Carlo simulations introduces errors in the value estimates, both in terms of bias and variance. Whilst reducing bias (typically through the addition of domain knowledge) has been studied in the MCTS literature, comparatively little effort has focused on reducing variance. This is somewhat surprising, since variance reduction techniques are a well-studied area in classical statistics. In this paper, we examine the application of some standard techniques for variance reduction in MCTS, including common random numbers, antithetic variates and control variates. We demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to MCTS and explore their efficacy on three different stochastic, single-agent settings: Pig, Can’t Stop and Dominion. ...|$|E
