2500|$|The Poetry Foundation's website characterizes Ryan's poems as follows: [...] "Like Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore before her, Ryan {{delights in}} quirks of logic and {{language}} and teases poetry {{out of the}} most unlikely places. She regards the 'rehabilitation of clichés,' for instance, {{as part of the}} poet’s mission. Characterized by subtle, surprising rhymes and nimble rhythms, her compact poems are charged with sly wit and off-beat wisdom." [...] J. D. McClatchy included Ryan in his 2003 anthology of contemporary American poetry. He wrote in his introduction, [...] "Her poems are compact, exhilarating, strange affairs, like Satie miniatures or Cornell boxes. … There are poets who start with lived life, still <b>damp</b> <b>with</b> sorrow or uncertainty, and lead it towards ideas about life. And there are poets who begin with ideas and draw life in towards their speculations. Marianne Moore and May Swenson were this latter sort of artist; so is Kay Ryan." ...|$|E

Finally, its hardware and software design of the measuring-controlling unit for MR <b>damper</b> <b>with</b> embedded controller, are introduced, and some test results are also show and analyzed.

However, the long range transverse wake field which can cause beam emittance dilution is one of the critical issues. We examined effectiveness of dipole mode damping in three kinds of X-band, {pi}-mode standing wave structures at 11. 424 GHz with no detuning considered. They represent three <b>damping</b> schemes: <b>damping</b> <b>with</b> cylindrical iris slot, <b>damping</b> <b>with</b> choke cavity and <b>damping</b> <b>with</b> waveguide coupler.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of a suspension system is to isolate and absorb the impact from road surface to vehicle body. To provide good riding comfort, a <b>damper</b> <b>with</b> variable and wide-range damping is highly needed. This paper presents a complete procedure from design, optimization to experiment for a magnetorheological (MR) <b>damper</b> <b>with</b> multiple poles. This new designed damper is entirely different from those conventional single-pole MR dampers, effectively by extending the range of damping force. Magnetic simulation {{has been done in}} the paper to provide an optimal structure of the damper which significantly enhances the damping force while avoids magnetic saturation. The new damper was also manufactured and tested. The experimental results show that the provided damping force can be significantly increased with the increase of input current from low to high speeds. Damping force can be varied by 7. 41 times. It proves that this new MR <b>damper</b> <b>with</b> high <b>damping</b> force can be controlled adaptively at wide range of operation conditions. It is suitable to be an adaptively variable damping source in semi-active suspension systems...|$|R
