Others said that, because a typical CIO was too focused on technology issues, there should be a new position created “to coordinate all Web-based activities and to put resources, both people and capital, into his or her organisation.” ...|$|E

Simons {{has acknowledged that}} asking [...] "whether Australia could, and should, develop a nuclear power service industry based on uranium enrichment and fuel rod manufacture for the global market" [...] is a key theme of the Institute's work. In a 2013 article entitled <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> nuclear energy for Australia? Simons proposed that goals of securing energy supply, maintaining economic growth and mitigating impacts of climate change could all be advanced by including nuclear in a [...] "low-emission energy mix" [...] for Australia. On UCL's role in the process he wrote: [...] "University College London’s International Energy Policy Institute (IEPI), based at its Australia campus in Adelaide, undertakes economic, regulatory and policy research on how Australia could develop a nuclear energy industry and manage its externalities, including decommissioning and waste."In late 2013, UCL staff and students contributed to conference papers investigating the subject of nuclear submarine development in Australia. Papers entitled What would it take for Australia to develop a nuclear-powered submarine capability? and From subs to Mines: What would it take for Australia to develop a nuclear-powered submarine capability? were presented in Brisbane, Australia and at the AIChE Annual Meeting in San Francisco, USA respectively. The subject was further explored in 2014 with the presentation of a conference paper entitled Selecting Nuclear-Powered Submarines in Australia: Nuclear Waste Consideration at a Waste Management conference (WM2014) in Phoenix, Arizona.|$|E
