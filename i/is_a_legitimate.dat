5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that currently make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.|$|E
5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one {{must be able to}} prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E

As a rule, Mr. Sengupta despises {{imagination}} and stories, which {{sets the stage}} for his later appearance on Kahani as antagonist Khattam-Shud. Khattam-Shud's defeat seems to correspond with Soraya's desertion of Mr. Sengupta, who does not appear again in person. His name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> Bengali surname.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues {{to follow the}} precedent set by Wickard v. Filburn. In Gonzales v. Raich it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.|$|E

25|$|Animal-assisted therapy, {{where an}} animal {{such as a}} dog or a horse becomes a basic part of a person's treatment, is a {{controversial}} treatment for some symptoms. A 2007 meta-analysis found that animal-assisted therapy {{is associated with a}} moderate improvement in autism spectrum symptoms. Reviews of published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.|$|E
25|$|Another coating {{treatment}} applies {{a thin film}} of synthetic diamond {{to the surface of}} a diamond simulant. This gives the simulated diamond certain characteristics of real diamond, including higher resistance to wear and scratching, higher thermal conductivity, and lower electrical conductivity. While resistance to wear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> goal of this technique, some employ it in order to make diamond simulants more difficult to detect through conventional means, which may be fraudulent if they are attempting to represent a simulated diamond as real.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins are an {{increasingly}} popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for {{mild to moderate}} depression. However, this study was criticized on several grounds. For example, {{it is not known}} whether dolphins are more effective than common pets. Reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.|$|E

25|$|Caroline {{was born}} on 23 January 1957 in the Prince's Palace, Monaco. She is the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly.

On 1 February 1965, her younger sister Princess Stéphanie was born. Caroline <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> patrilineal descendant of the Dukes of Polignac, and as such belongs to the historical French nobility. Through her mother, she is of Irish and German descent.|$|E
25|$|In the {{constitutional}} {{challenges to the}} Citizenship and Entry to Israel Law, the state, represented by the Attorney General, insisted that security was the only objective behind the law. The state also added {{that even if the}} law was intended to achieve demographic objectives, it is still in conformity with Israel's Jewish and democratic definition and thus constitutional. In a 2012 ruling by the Supreme Court on the issue, some of the judges on the panel discussed demography and were inclined to accept that demography <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> consideration in devising family reunification policies that violate the right to family life.|$|E
25|$|The {{third part}} {{concerns}} predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great {{events such as}} plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> area of study, and argues that {{the effect on the}} weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times.|$|E
