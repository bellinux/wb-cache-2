5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blank,</b> Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E
25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank.</b> If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has {{remained}} {{one of the}} few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park. When the park requires repairing or is in need of empty beds filled, the Nursery provides its wide variety of plants to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> spaces. Indoors, the plants are set up in neat rows and beds, showing off the nursery’s green diversity for the buyers picking. The Golden Gate Park Nursery is one of the city’s main green providers and is greatly responsible for the city’s plant life.|$|E

25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank,</b> by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
500|$|Pinker is a {{frequent}} participant in public debates surrounding the contributions of science to contemporary society. Social commentators such as Ed West, author of The Diversity Illusion, consider Pinker important and daring in his willingness to confront taboos, as <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blank</b> Slate. This doctrine (the tabula rasa), writes West, remained accepted [...] "as fact, rather than fantasy" [...] {{a decade after the}} book's publication. West describes Pinker as [...] "no polemicist, and he leaves readers to draw their own conclusions".|$|E
500|$|After {{surviving}} a thunderstorm, {{the flying}} house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness {{themselves to the}} still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, known as the mythical [...] "Snipe", whom he names [...] "Kevin". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar {{that allows him to}} speak and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, and are taken to their master, who turns out to be Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains to them that he is searching for a giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they are attempting to capture the bird themselves. Carl flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. After Carl saves the house, he and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is upset at Carl for abandoning Kevin. Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and is surprised to find that she has filled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the [...] "adventure" [...] and encouraging him to go have a new one.|$|E

2500|$|Following her nomination, Palin {{was often}} tagged with the epithet [...] "Caribou Barbie," [...] {{a play on}} Malibu Barbie, owing to her {{background}} as a beauty pageant contestant in her home state of Alaska. Palin herself uttered this phrase when she made an October 18, 2008 guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> for Alec Baldwin, who could not remember what people called her. Baldwin later referred to Palin as [...] "Bible Spice" [...] in an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. The epithet Caribou Barbie has been contrasted with Palin's usage of Mama grizzly to describe herself and later to describe other moms seeking political office.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{nativism}} is most {{associated with}} the work of Jerry Fodor (1935–), Noam Chomsky (1928–), and Steven Pinker (1954–), who argue that humans from birth have certain cognitive modules (specialised genetically inherited psychological abilities) that allow them to learn and acquire certain skills, such as language. For example, children demonstrate a facility for acquiring spoken language but require intensive training to learn to read and write. This poverty of the stimulus observation became a principal component of Chomsky's argument for a [...] "language organ"—a genetically inherited neurological module that confers a somewhat universal understanding of syntax that all neurologically healthy humans are born with, which is fine-tuned by an individual's experience with their native language. [...] <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blank</b> Slate (2002), Pinker similarly cites the linguistic capabilities of children, relative to the amount of direct instruction they receive, as evidence that humans have an inborn facility for speech acquisition (but not for literacy acquisition).|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structure}} of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and {{there was even a}} text book entitled ALM [...] ) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was [...] "pattern practice," [...] which were drills expecting [...] "automatic" [...] responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as [...] "mimicry-memorization." [...] 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. [...] 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{arrhythmia}} recurrences after {{pulmonary vein}} isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF) are accepted {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period. Their relevance for long-term efficacy is not well-known. We evaluated patients, who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF, or had a registered episode of AF on the 24 -hour Holter 6 weeks after PVI and compared it with long-term outcome. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF were treated with <b>the</b> PVAC. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 3 -month <b>blanking</b> period patients who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF on ECG were recorded. 6 weeks after procedure a 24 -hour Holter was performed. After 3 months patients {{were asked if they}} felt a relapse. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months with ECG, 7 -day Holter at 6 and/or 12 months, and event recording if needed. RESULTS: Within <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period, 25 / 100 (25 %) patients had a documented recurrence of AF while 46 / 100 (46 %) patients felt a relapse. After <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period up to 12 months, 53 / 100 (53 %) patients were free of AF without anti-arrhythmic drugs. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that absence of AF <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period (OR 0. 22 95 %CI [0. 05 - 0. 98]) and absence of a relapse of symptoms suspect for AF during <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period (OR 0. 21 95 %CI [0. 06 - 0. 52]) were independent predictors of successful long-term outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Poor long-term outcome is strongly related to patients who experienced palpitations with ECG documented AF, AF on the 24 -hour Holter at 6 weeks after PVI and a relapse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> period...|$|R
