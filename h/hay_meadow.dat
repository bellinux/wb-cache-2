25|$|By {{the fourteenth}} century most farming {{was based on the}} Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams. These were allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, who were usually known as husbandmen or bonders. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland, known as a husbandland, was 26 acres, or 2 oxgangs. They would also have had a share of <b>hay</b> <b>meadow</b> and common pasture. Below the husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants, were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands.|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of traditional management practices {{is essential for}} the conservation of the biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands including species-rich <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> In the canton Valais (Switzerland), <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> are traditionally irrigated using open water channels. However, since the 1980 s, this labour intensive irrigation technique has been increasingly replaced by sprinkler irrigation. This study examined whether the different irrigation techniques (traditional vs. sprinkler) influence the local biodiversity of species-rich <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> In particular, the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of eight traditionally irrigated meadows were compared with those of eight sprinkler-irrigated meadows. It was also assessed whether the species of either meadow type differed in functional traits. A high plant species richness was found in the meadows investigated. The study showed that the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> were not affected by the change in irrigation technique 8 – 18 years ago. However, a lower grass/forb-ratio was observed in traditionally than in sprinkler-irrigated meadows. Furthermore, irrigation technique affected the leaf distribution and the onset of seed shedding in plants. Thus, the change in the irrigation technique altered only some aspects of biodiversity.

40|$|Questions: Which are {{the main}} {{vegetation}} types of lowland <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and pastures in Western and Central Europe? What {{are the main}} environmental gradients that drive patterns of species composition? Is it possible to classify these grasslands to phytosociological alliances that reflect management practices? Location: Western and Central Europe (excluding the Alps and Carpathians). Methods: A database of 21 400 vegetation plots of mesic grasslands across Western and Central Europe was compiled. After geographically stratified resampling, semi-supervised classification based on the K-means algorithm was applied to assign a subset of plots into 32 a priori association-level vegetation types and to search for new types within the subset of non-assigned plots. The vegetation plots assigned into the final vegetation types were submitted to another K-means classification to show the grouping into higher-level vegetation types. Results: A total of 36 associations were distinguished in the resampled subset of 8277 vegetation plots and were grouped into four large groups: (1) eutrophic and intensively managed <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and permanent pastures; (2) nutrient-rich grasslands developed from recently abandoned fields or managed under irregular practices of mowing and manuring; (3) non-eutrophic lowland and submontane hay meadows; (4) extensively managed pastures and Atlantic grazed <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> A PCoA of the associations of these four groups showed that extensively managed pastures were floristically more similar to non-eutrophic <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> than to permanent intensively managed pastures, which was more obvious in the Atlantic region than in Central Europe. Species composition of the lowland <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> was clearly differentiated according to biogeographic sectors. Other floristic differences were related to climate, altitude, soil base status and topography. Conclusions: This analysis challenges the traditional concept of mesic grassland alliances separating <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> from pastures. New classification should be based mainly on the differences in management intensity rather than in management practice. Consequently, nutrient-poor extensive pastures, which currently are not considered in the European Habitats Directive, should receive the same conservation attention as low-intensive <b>hay</b> <b>meadows,</b> because both types of vegetation can be equally species-rich and do not differ substantially in floristic composition from each other...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{describe}} the relative importance of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and other types of semi-natural grasslands for species diversity and to focus on the impact of the fragmentation of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> on species diversity. The study area was the rural districts of Hjartdal and Seljord in the county of Telemark, southern Norway. Interrelationships between the landscape and vegetation were revealed by combining research at three hierarchical levels, i. e. the landscape, biotope and species levels. A descriptive and analytical technique based on CIR aerial photo interpretation was developed for the landscape mesoscale. The historical background of the landscape and former biotope patterns were described, since traditional and sustained management is an important parameter in the landscape ecological analysis. The vegetation of different grassland biotopes was classified and numerically analysed. The results of the aerial photo interpretation revealed a landscape with considerable complexity and high biodiversity both at landscape level and at biotope and species level, due to the many traditional <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and pastures still left in this area. The results also showed that the remaining fragments of traditional <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> are of vital importance for biological diversity. They had the highest average number of species per subplot and furthermore contained species that did not occur in any other grassland biotopes. In addition, the largest populations of several grassland species were found in the traditionally managed <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> Unfertilised pastures and verge...|$|R

40|$|Semi-natural grasslands {{including}} <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> {{belong to}} the most species-rich habitats in central Europe and are therefore of high conservation value. The high biodiversity of these grasslands has been maintained for many centuries through the regular disturbance by traditional management practices. In the Valais, an arid mountain region of Switzerland, traditional management of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> includes irrigation by open water channels. In the past decades, however, the traditional irrigation technique was increasingly replaced by more efficient sprinkler-irrigation systems or irrigation was stopped on marginal and poorly accessible areas. Within {{the scope of this}} thesis, four studies were conducted to investigate different aspects of these changes in meadow irrigation. The aim of the first study was to examine whether land-use abandonment resulting from the cessation of irrigation influenced the biodiversity of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> in the Valais. For this purpose, plant and gastropod surveys were conducted in three serial stages of succession (<b>hay</b> <b>meadows,</b> early abandoned meadows and young forests). Meadow abandonment resulted in an increase in gastropod species richness and a loss of plant and gastropod species characteristic for open grassland habitats. Furthermore, functional traits of plants (plant height, the start of seed shedding and the type of reproduction) and gastropods (shell size) were affected by abandonment. Traditional meadow irrigation is assumed to distribute the water more heterogeneously than sprinkler irrigation, which might affect meadow biodiversity as well as the distribution of plants in a small scale. The aim of the second study was to examine whether the change from traditional to sprinkler irrigation affected the local biodiversity (plants and gastropods) of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> in the Valais. A high plant species richness was found in the <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> investigated. The diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species did not differ between traditionally and sprinkler-irrigated meadows. However, the installation of sprinkler systems resulted in an increase in the grass-to-forb ratio and affected the leaf distribution and the start of seed shedding in plants. The third study aimed to investigate whether the change in irrigation technique affected the small-scale distribution of plants and soil characteristics in these <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> Three sampling plots consisting of 13 subplots of increasing size were installed in traditionally and sprinkler-irrigated meadows to assess plant species richness and soil characteristics within subplots. The type of irrigation technique did not affect the shape of the plant species-area relationship. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation in the soil characteristics examined was low and their small-scale distributions were mostly not influenced by the irrigation technique. These findings indicate a pronounced small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of plant species and soil characteristics in the <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> investigated. Therefore, as practiced in our study areas, the distribution of water by sprinklers might be less homogenous than commonly assumed. The abandonment of traditional management practices of semi-natural grasslands is suggested to result in a reduced landscape heterogeneity, which in turn might contribute to the loss of local plant diversity. The fourth study aimed to investigate whether the change from traditional to sprinkler irrigation resulted in alterations in the surrounding landscape of species-rich <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> Furthermore, we asked if plant diversity of differently irrigated meadows is influenced by landscape composition and the heterogeneity of the surrounding landscape. Landscape composition was more diverse for traditionally than for sprinkler-irrigated meadows, but did not differ prior to the installation of sprinklers. A diverse small-scale landscape composition in the close surroundings of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> had a positive effect on the number of generalists but not on total plant species richness or the number of specialists. Finally, sprinkler-irrigated meadows had an increased number of generalist plant species. The findings of this thesis suggest that the installation of sprinklers did not affect the local species richness of plants and gastropods in the <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> investigated. Nevertheless, the change in irrigation technique influenced functional aspects of plant diversity (plant traits, grass-to-forb ratio and generalist species). Furthermore, the installation of sprinklers was associated with a homogenization of the landscape, which may eventually result in an intensification of land use. For the conservation of the biodiversity of these <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> it is recommended to maintain the relatively extensive irrigation and management practices. ...|$|R
