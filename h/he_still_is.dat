5|$|Following Drygas' movie, Ryszard Siwiec was posthumously {{awarded a}} number of Czech, Slovak and Polish state decorations. Memorial plaques {{dedicated}} to his memory exist in Warsaw, Dębica and Przemyśl. A bridge in Przemyśl, where he lived, was named after him in 1991, {{as well as a}} street in Prague in front of the Czech Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, with a nearby memorial dedicated to him, unveiled in 2010. A street in Warsaw was named for him in 2011. Nonetheless, as noted by Kavaliauskas in 2010, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> less known than other self-immolators of his time.|$|E

Nevertheless, Carlos tells her that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> not unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E

500|$|Rumors of a {{possible}} full-length Arrested Development film circulated after the possibility was referenced in season 3's final episode, [...] "Development Arrested". In 2008, Howard was slated to direct the film, {{though it is not}} clear if <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is.</b> Reportedly, all original members of the main cast are expected to reprise their original roles. As of July 11, 2013, Netflix was in discussions for a fifth season. In August 2013, Hurwitz commented [...] "I'm working on the movie right now" [...] and his plan is to do another season after the movie is completed. In August 2014, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated in an interview with USA Today that there is a strong possibility of a fifth season. [...] "It's just a matter of when." [...] In April 2015, executive producer Brian Grazer confirmed that a fifth season is in development and will consist of 17 episodes. Jason Bateman contradicted this in February 2016, however, and said regarding a fifth season, [...] "There is no plan. I haven't heard of anything solid going forward." [...] However, in January 2017, executive producer Brian Grazer again confirmed a fifth season plan, stating that all of the original series actors are on board for a new season, with an official deal expected to be made [...] "within a couple of weeks".|$|E
2500|$|Hancock said of Shorter's {{tenure in}} the group: [...] "The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> a master. Wayne {{was one of}} the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed." [...] Davis said, [...] "Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for {{everybody}} just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Sharma {{was called}} to join the Indian squad for the tour of South Africa in 2006–07. However, after {{receiving}} the call and organising travel arrangements, it was decided not to send him on the tour. In reference to his height and lean physique in his Under-19 days, the bowler was nicknamed Lambu. In 2011, he became the fifth youngest player to take 100Test wickets. Against South Africa in 2013, Ishant Sharma became the fifth quickest Indian to grab 100 ODI wickets. While being a [...] "rhythm" [...] bowler, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> {{considered one of the}} fastest Indian bowlers having bowled in excess of 150km/h on several occasions in international cricket as well as the IPL, his fastest being 152.2km/h bowled to Ricky Ponting on Boxing Day Test in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} operations, which in Chapter Five had been postponed, was a [...] "holding attack" [...] on Huesca, {{designed}} {{to draw the}} Nationalist troops away from an Anarchist attack on [...] "the Jaca road." [...] It is described herein. It {{is one of the}} most significant military actions that Orwell participates in in his entire time in Spain. Orwell notes the offensive of that night where his group of fifteen captured a Nationalist position, but then retreated to their lines with captured rifles and ammunition. However, despite these finds, Orwell and his group were forced to pull back before they could secure a large telescope they had discovered in a machine gun case, something more badly needed to their side than any single weapon. However, the diversion was successful in drawing troops from the Anarchist attack. The chapter ends with Orwell lamenting that even now <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> upset about losing the telescope.|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff for}} the first season {{consisted}} of Kripke and five other writers, with assistants to help with researching urban legends. Most of the work done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the writers often breaking up into groups. At {{the beginning of each}} season, the writers are brought together and pitch their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary changes. Afterward, the script is written, and Kripke goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other episodes. Kripke found this task very difficult to do in the first season, but he felt it became easier by the third season, as the staff came to [...] "really understand the show's style". Following the fifth season, Kripke stepped down as showrunner but maintained his connection with the series as an executive consultant. In a 2006 interview with Collider, he responded to the question as to how involved <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> with the show with the answer: [...] "I would define myself as a proud parent who has sent their child off to college." [...] He elaborate on this analogy, explaining, [...] "I'm there if they need me, I'm happy to help, but I also stay out of their way if they don't need me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is,</b> obviously, because of the way he bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did. He bowled really well there, and I was expecting him come to these conditions and bowl well here as well." [...] The injury prevented Onions from playing most of the English cricket season. He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating. When you've had a place in the team for a while and you lose it it's hugely disappointing and hurts a lot. Before the injury everything had been like a dream for me, all I ever wanted to do was play for England, but the last six months have been tough." [...] In April 2010 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. Onions did not recover in time to play in the 2010–11 Ashes series. However he was named in England's 27-man performance squad the following March after recovering from surgery.|$|E

60|$|He wants, he asks, he pleads his poverty, They within doors do him an alms deny. He doth repeat and {{aggravate}} his grief, But they repulse him, {{give him}} no relief. He begs, they say, Begone; {{he will not}} hear, But coughs, sighs, and makes signs <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> there; They disregard him, he repeats his groans; They still say nay, and he himself bemoans. They grow more rugged, they call him vagrant; He cries the shriller, trumpets out his want. At last, when they perceive he'll take no nay, An alms they give him without more delay.|$|E

60|$|Our Duke--in {{spite of}} his disgrace, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> ours, and yours too, I hope, gentlest reader--our Duke found himself at Cleve Park again, in a {{different}} circle from the one {{to which he had}} been chiefly accustomed. The sporting world received him with open arms. With some of these worthies, as owner of Sanspareil, he had become slightly acquainted. But what is half a morning at Tattersall's, or half a week at Doncaster, compared with a meeting at Newmarket? There your congenial spirits congregate. Freemasons every man of them! No uninitiated wretch there dares to disturb, with his profane presence, the hallowed mysteries. There the race is not a peg to hang a few days of dissipation on, but a sacred ceremony, to the celebration of which all men and all circumstances tend and bend. No balls, no concerts, no public breakfasts, no bands from Litolf, no singers from Welsh, no pineapples from Gunter, are there called for by thoughtless thousands, who have met, not from any affection for the turfs delights or their neighbour's cash, but to sport their splendid liveries and to disport their showy selves.|$|E
6000|$|... "'If Paul de Florac {{in any way}} resembles his mother, {{between you}} and him {{there ought to be}} a very warm regard. I knew her when I was a boy, long before you were born or thought of; and in {{wandering}} forty years through the world since, I have seen no woman in my eyes so good or so beautiful. Your cousin Ethel reminded me of her; as handsome, but not so lovely. Yes, it was that pale lady you saw at Paris, with eyes full of care, and hair streaked with grey. So it will be the turn of you young folks, come eight more lustres, and your heads will be bald like mine, or grey like Madame de Florac's, and bending over the ground where we are lying in quiet. I understand from you that young Paul is not in very flourishing circumstances. If <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> in need, mind and be his banker, and I will be yours. Any child of hers must never want when I have a spare guinea. I do not mind telling you, sir, that I cared for her more than millions of guineas once; and half broke my heart about her when I went to India, as a young chap. So, if any such misfortunes happen to you, consider, my boy, you are not the only one.|$|E
6000|$|We {{remember}} that unpleasant Heidelberg affair: how hopeful it once looked; fact DONE, Church of the Holy Ghost fairly ours; your CORPUS EVANGELICORUM fallen quasi-dead; and nothing now {{for it but}} protocolling by diplomatists, pleading in the Diets by men in bombazine, never like ending at all;--when Friedrich Wilhelm did suddenly end it; suddenly locked up his own Catholic establishments and revenues, and quietly inexorable put the key in his pocket; as it were, drew his own whip, with a [...] "Will you whip MY Jew?"--and we had to cower out of the affair, Kaiser himself ordering us, in a most humiliated manner! Readers can judge whether Kur-Pfalz was {{likely to have a}} kindly note of Friedrich Wilhelm in that corner of his memory. The poor man felt so disgusted with Heidelberg, he quitted it soon after. He would not go to Dusseldorf (in the Berg-and-Julich quarter), as his Forefathers used to do; but set up his abode at Mannheim, where <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>is.</b> Friedrich Wilhelm, who was far from meaning harm or insolence in that Heidelberg affair, hopes there is no grudge remaining. But so stand the facts: it is towards Mannheim, not towards Heidelberg that we are now travelling!--For the rest, this scheme of reprisals, or whipping your Jew if you whip mine, answered so well, Friedrich Wilhelm has used it, or threatened to use, as the real method, ever since, where needful; and has saved thereby much bombazine eloquence, and confusion to mankind, on several occasions.|$|E
