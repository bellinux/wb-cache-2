5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed {{in charge of the}} British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E

5|$|Whitney {{takes an}} {{interest}} in Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets. When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant {{to make up for}} it. Whitney agrees to go on a date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> she knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E

Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
25|$|Law {{decided that}} the November party conference was {{the perfect time to}} {{announce}} the withdrawal of the Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne should <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed {{out at the end of}} the day Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of Standing Orders of the House at Churchill, hitting him on the head. Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them they had been planned by the party Whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Grace Chappell argues that, without {{external}} reasons for action, it becomes impossible {{to maintain that}} {{the same set of}} moral reasons applies to all agents equally. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, [...] "involves treating the person who is blamed like someone who had a reason {{to do the right thing}} but did not do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{not having a}} studio {{attached}} before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt [...] "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her." [...] Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming {{that he was the}} only person who could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the story [...] "was in his heart and in his mind".|$|E

He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun.

500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahmadzai {{used the}} {{technique}} of making the music freeze midrhythm throughout American Life, including [...] "Love Profusion". One technique was the stutter edit, which Ahmadzaï clarified was not characteristic of his production and recording. [...] "People get upset {{because they think it}} is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it is natural. The stuttering can help you create a new groove", he said. The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{composed}} by Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura {{stated that he}} was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog, as he had just started with Dreams Come True. He wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> Sega said the game {{was going to be}} better than Mario, and was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. He adapted the Genesis' sound chip, and believed the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it [...] "impossible". Nakamura wrote the soundtrack concurrently with [...] "Million Kisses", a studio album for Dreams Come True.|$|E

500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later. [...] "The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have.

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E
500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, like most of the movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E
