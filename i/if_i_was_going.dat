5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Gillard's {{mother told}} ABC TV's Australian Story program that Gillard had spoken {{from a young}} age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm not sure I could have. There's {{something}} in me that's focused and single-minded and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do that, I'm not sure I could have done this." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{induction}} ceremony, Pearson {{said that he}} felt the inaugural class should include more pioneers such as Raymond Parks, Tim Flock, and Lee Petty. Pearson said [...] "I feel like <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> in next year and I knew Raymond Parks wasn't, I'd withdraw my name to get him in." [...] In 2010, Pearson {{was named to the}} 2011 class in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. He received the most votes, from 50 of 53 voters. [...] "I am just proud that that many people thought enough to vote for me", Pearson said. He added that he had not felt slighted by Bill France, Jr. beating him into the 2010 class by one vote. He was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E

500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I {{was never going to}} leave the band. It was just that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Briskly.] Well, at {{all events}} that's some comfort. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> done {{out of my}} night's rest, I should like {{to take it out}} of some one.|$|R

500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E
500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E
500|$|Friends was Aniston's sixth sitcom; {{each of her}} {{previous}} ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms {{in spite of her}} preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, [...] "When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be still playing Rachel." [...] Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, [...] "I'm auditioning for your part in Friends." [...] Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because [...] "in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable," [...] commending the actress for [...] "breathing life into a difficult character." ...|$|E

In October 2012, bassist and frequent collaborator Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented: [...] "I would estimate that there are currently about three or four albums’ worth of material floating around," [...] and Beck himself said that [...] "I wasn't sure <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to put out a record – or if I should put out a record.
