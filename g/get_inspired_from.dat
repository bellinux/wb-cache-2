40|$|Eclectic {{fashion is}} {{considered}} to be a selecting what appears to best in various styles. Furthermore it could be identified as deriving ideas, style or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources. During the Kotte period in Sri Lanka Portuguese influences affected the fashion of the royalty due to changing their religion to Christianity. Ultimately they embraced western lifestyleandpartly abandoned their jewelry bedecked bare upper body style and combined a western stitched long sleeved loose jacket with the existing clinging draped cloth. Subsequently the early phases of the Kandyan King‘s attire totally ignored the traditional lower long cloth and adopted the western trousers with long sleeved jacket. They became fashion fanatics and eager to acquire many fashion details from different fashion sources. The literary evidences proved that the royal males had an exotic taste. They were not hesitating to <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> the west and produce their own fashion. This paper explores emerging sartorial complexities of dress composition which entailed an eclectic fashion movement in Sri Lanka...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{brand is}} a {{significant}} element of the differentiation in the highly competitive environment. The {{first step in the}} systematic brand building is to define its identity, which ensures the consistency of a brand over time. The goal of the master's thesis is to find out how czech brand consultants define the brand identity. In the master's thesis there is a comparison of the most frequently used elements in the theoretical models and brand bibles of foreign companies with approaches of czech consultants. Theoretical models and brand bibles have been analyzed by using conceptual content analysis. Qualitative research was used to find out approaches to the brand identity of czech consultants. Results of the qualitative research and the synthesis of the theoretical and practical part revealed that czech consultants <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> abroad, where some of them use models and some of them approach to defining brand identity instinctively. The master's thesis brings the primary insight into this field within the Czech Republic and {{can be used as a}} base for mapping the whole situation in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} how the playing of {{children}} is being affected by watching TV, if it is being affected at all? Is TV consumption promoting or restraining the playing of children? Can children identify with a TV-character? The study was carried out at a school with children 6 to 8 years old. I have interviewed five children, two 6 year olds, one child of 7 and two children who are 8 years old. I recorded the interview so I could listen to it afterwards, and concentrate on the childrens body language during the interview. I observed children playing during the recess. I also gave questionnaires to the five children's parents. I {{wanted to know the}} parents opinion about the TV-habits of their children, but the questionnaires did not have any major effect on the study. I haved drawn on, and related my findings to older research, specially the work of the swedish media researcher Margareta Rönnberg. Children's playing is a reflection of what they have experienced and what they've seen and heard both on TV and from people around them. Identity is something you have in yourself. It's who you are and how you will react in different situations. But the identity is not the same over your lifetime. It changes when you meet with new situations and encounter other people. My major conclusion is that children's playing <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> what they see. Children don´t only look on children's TV-shows, they look at many adult TV-shows as well, and their playing gets inspiration from it. They mix the things they found interesting on TV with things they have been through personally. Children can identify with characters from TV and recognize themselvs in them. The identification can be based on personality or on the outer likeness in special features as hair colour etc...|$|E
50|$|<b>Getting</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> Zainul Abedin, Jamini Roy, Quamrul Hassan {{chose to}} give the folk art {{tradition}} a breath of life by incorporating modern ideas in it. He always borrowed the two-dimensionality of pata paintings of fork art in his work, he also attempted {{to give the}} quality of three-dimensionality in it. Instead of using mixed colours, in most of his paintings he used primary colors like pata painters. Sometimes, like folk artists, he applied flat colors without creating tonal variations. However, he has attempted to create color perspective by using various colors in one plane, so that a sense of height, distance can be created in the image. This technique was <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> Henri Matisse. Patriotism was born in him due to his involvement in folk art. Some of his notable works are: Goon Tana, The Happy Return, Biral, Nabanna, Gorur Snan etc. All of these paintings highlight the lives of lower-class people {{which has been the}} topmost priority of his paintings.|$|R

40|$|The growing {{threat of}} a rapidly {{changing}} climate is undoubtedly one of our cities' most pressing issues. Despite the scientific knowledge about the future impacts of climate change, {{only a limited number}} of European cities have established climate adaptation plans. This paucity of political investment can be partially explained by a lack of understanding from both civil society and decision-makers themselves, because the common scientific statements are usually unintelligible and inapplicable for most of the stakeholders. The Climate Twins approach, by linking the future climate of a European city with the current climate of another one, is an innovative approach that can be easily used and understood by non-specialists, providing readily understandable climate information on the impacts of climate change on urban areas and on the existing measures and strategies to cope with such issue. We have reasonably matched seventeen twins from which we can say that the future climate of a city “A” will be significantly similar to the current climate of a city “B”. As an example, we have linked the future climate of Hamburg with the current climate of Toulouse. By linking these current and future climates, this approach allows a better understanding of the forthcoming impacts of a changing climate. Through the comparative analysis of the Climate Twins, we have showed that stakeholders from a city “A” could clearly envision the requirements for a better adaptation to climate change. Moreover, they could <b>get</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> the current climate-resilient practices promoted in a city “B” and hence, could take those ideas and actions on board for the implementation of a future climate adaptation plan in their own city. As an illustration, we have investigated how and to what extent the city of Hamburg could learn from the city of Toulouse in terms of heat waves management...|$|E

The film's screenplay was written by NanjilNadu T. N. Rajappa.The producers had originally chosen Bhanumathi for the titular character. However she opted out as she felt uncomfortable shooting with her hands being tied back for many scenes. Kannada actress M. V. Rajamma was chosen for the role.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 58 - 62. Caged compounds {{have attracted}} great attention {{due to their}} use in the elucidation of numerous biochemical processes. Photolabile caged compounds release covalently bound moieties upon exposure of ultraviolet light. Releasing the active species in such a controlled manner enables concentration of the molecules to be manipulated in spatiotemporal way. <b>Getting</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>from</b> the knowledge of cellular information transfer through second messenger systems which Ca and Zn ions play important role, we synthesized a photolabile caged Zn(II) compound so that we benefit from its controlled ion release feature, so as to integrate two molecular logic gates physically. For that reason, a molecular logic operation was designed and the released ion was used as information carrier from one logic gate to other. After proving its practicality, we tested same principle for higher molecular logic systems. To do that, photolabile caged Zn(II) compound and previously proved supermolecule with coupled AND logic gates were physically integrated. Results proved that photolabile caged Zn(II) compounds is a useful way to combine two separate logic gates by means of free zinc ions. From this point of view, the approach physical integration of molecular logic gates through a metal ion or compound might be a solution for building more complex molecular logic systems.
