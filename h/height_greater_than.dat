40|$|A {{procedure}} was devised for routine examination of feces for Clostridium difficile with selective enrichment broth culture containing {{increased levels of}} carbohydrates and antibiotics to detect cytotoxin and volatile acids in broths inoculated with fecal samples. C. difficile was detected and identified with a rapidity {{comparable to that of}} conventional culture on selective cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar. Detection rates for C. difficile in inoculated broths (111 / 401 or 27 %) were significantly higher than for culture on cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (47 / 401 or 11 %, P <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001). All fecal samples containing C. difficile and cytotoxin were correctly identified by the procedure. Isocaproic acid peak <b>heights</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 2 mm in selective enrichment broths inoculated with fecal samples indicated that C. difficile was present in the fecal sample examined. Of the positive specimens examined, 58 % (64 / 111) produced peak <b>heights</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 10 mm. Peak heights less than 2 mm were not associated with C. difficile in the fecal sample. The investigated procedure provided a reliable alternative to the routine processing of feces for detecting C. difficile and associated cytotoxin in feces. Inoculated broths with isocaproic acid peak <b>heights</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 2 mm, after 24 to 48 h of incubation, and in which cytotoxin was detected, were subcultured to blood agar to obtain isolates of the organism as required.
