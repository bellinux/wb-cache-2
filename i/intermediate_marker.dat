40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) is a premalignant condition, due {{to chronic}} gastroesophageal reflux. Effective antireflux therapy may diminish cancer risk. To evaluate this option an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> is needed. We developed a methodology for measurement of epithelial cell proliferative activity of Barrett's mucosa as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> and correlated the activity with traditional cancer risk markers and other parameters. Fifty-six patients (21 - 74 years of age) with Barrett's esophagus and established acid gastroesophageal reflux were included. Biopsies {{were taken from}} Barrett's mucosa at 3 -cm intervals. Reflux was measured by 24 -hr pH-metry. Proliferative activity was determined using in vitro labeling with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine and immunohistochemistry and was expressed as labeling index (LI). The length of BE correlated with erect acid reflux (P = 0. 002). LI in specialized columnar metaplasia was higher than in gastric metaplasia, especially in crypt epithelium (P < 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis revealed independent positive correlations for surface LI with dysplasia (P 0. 011), distance from the incisors (P = 0. 041), and crypt LI (P = 0. 000). Crypt LI showed an independent positive correlation with the length of BE (P = 0. 033) and type of metaplasia (P = 0. 007). In conclusion, epithelial cell proliferative activity of BE correlates with several known risk factors for cancer. Proliferative activity is an attractive <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> to evaluate the effects of interventional measures to decrease cancer risk in Barrett's esophagus...|$|E

40|$|Dietary {{fats and}} oils provide {{calories}} and essential fatty acids and are sources of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Certain types of fat, however, can increase risk of chronic cardiovascular diseases that affect the heart, blood vessels, and brain. The type of fat that is consumed can have either positive or negative effects on risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Saturated fatty acids (SFA) and trans fatty acids are generally considered unhealthy; whereas, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered beneficial. The effect of dietary SFA on CVD risk is partially mediated by effects on blood lipids, in particular, increased total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The EC Concerted Action PASSCLAIM aims {{to produce}} a generic tool for {{assessing}} the scientific support for health-related claims for foods and food components. AIM: The task of the ITGB Working Group was to critically evaluate the categories of scientific evidence needed to support claims in relation to bone health and osteoporosis. METHODS: A framework was developed to describe the chain of evidence that is required to link the consumption of a food or food component to bone health outcomes. Techniques available for interrogating each link in the chain were identified and their strengths and weaknesses considered. This framework {{was used to determine}} intermediate markers of health outcome with respect to osteoporosis and to debate the level of evidence that would be required to substantiate claims of enhanced function or reduced disease risk. RESULTS: Use of this framework with osteoporotic fracture as the health endpoint resulted in the following judgements based on current knowledge: 1) bone mineral density (BMD) is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> of bone health which, for people of any age and sex, can provide evidence of enhanced function; 2) for people over 50 years living in populations with a high incidence of fracture, BMD is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> of osteoporotic fracture risk which can provide evidence of an increased probability of reduced disease risk; 3) because osteoporosis is defined as a state of increased fracture risk due to low bone mass and deterioration in bone microarchitecture, a claim of a definite reduction in osteoporosis or fracture risk requires similar substantiation to claims that fractures are prevented or treated, including clinical trials and animal studies; 4) data from lower in the chain of evidence, such as bone turnover and calcium bioavailability, are not, by themselves, sufficiently strongly related to bone health endpoints to provide evidence of enhanced function or reduced disease risk but can provide supporting information. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of existing scientific knowledge, a framework has been developed as a tool for considering the scientific support for claims relating to bone health and osteoporosis. To provide a working example, the framework has been used to assess the current position with osteoporotic fracture as the health endpoint. This experience will contribute to the formulation under PASSCLAIM of a generic tool for assessing the scientific support of health claims on foods...|$|E

Methods—Participants were 1677 individuals aged ≥ 65 years from the 3 -City Dijon study, who were free of stroke and dementia at baseline, followed-up for ≤ 12 years. Results—Both lesion types were comparably {{associated with an increased}} risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1. 72; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 24 – 2. 40 for WMH volume and hazard ratio, 2. 15; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 18 – 3. 93 for brain infarcts), but only WMH volume was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 1. 41; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 09 – 1. 83). Conclusions—The differential impact of WMH and brain infarcts on clinical stroke and dementia suggests relatively different prognostic value of the 2 lesions.

In addition, proteolytic activity levels in the buccal cells were increased nearly 3 -fold in patients with oral trauma (P < 0. 01) or diabetes (P < 0. 02), as well as pregnant women (P < 0. 04). Excluding these subgroups of patients in epidemiological studies increase the differences in levels of proteolytic activities between both the nonsmoking comparison group and smokers and between the comparison group and patients with oral leukoplakia or erythroplakia. Evaluation of prerandomization levels of proteolytic activities of patients in cancer chemoprevention trials will increase the statistical power by allowing stratified randomization based on levels of proteolytic activities.

Thus, this subpopulation of first-degree relatives could provide very important information {{with regard to the}} investigation of endophenotypes for schizophrenia that could clarify the often contradictory findings in schizophrenia high-risk populations. To date, despite the extant literature on schizophrenia endophenotypes, we are only aware of one other study that examined the neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive abnormalities in this group. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether a more homogeneous group of relatives, such as POCs, have neural abnormalities that may be related to schizophrenia. Methods We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to collect blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) response data in six POCs and eight unrelated healthy controls while performing under conditions of sustained, selective and divided attention. Results The POCs indicated alterations in a widely distributed network of regions involved in attention processes, such as the prefrontal and temporal (including the parahippocampal gyrus) cortices, in addition to the anterior cingulate gyrus. More specifically, a general reduction in BOLD response was found in these areas compared to the healthy participants during attention processes. Conclusion These preliminary findings of decreased activity in POCs indicate that this more homogeneous population of unaffected relatives share similar neural abnormalities with people with schizophrenia, suggesting that reduced BOLD activity in the attention network may be an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> for schizophrenia. </p...|$|E

Further understanding of the molecular effects of estrogen and its deprivation in normal breast tissue may allow the development of biomarkers of risk of breast cancer and help to predict the value of chemo-prevention with aromatase inhibitors. Core biopsies of normal breast tissue were taken before and after letrozole treatment from postmenopausal women in the LITMaS pilot prevention study. RNAwas extracted from these samples and used for cDNA microarray analysis. Gene expression changes induced by letrozole treatment were much less extensive than observed in estrogen receptor–positive malignant tissue; however, overall, they correlated to a highly significant degree (r = 0. 511;P < 1020). As well as some classically estrogen-associated genes, many genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling were affected by estrogen deprivation in the normal breast in vivo. These data indicate for the first time that gene expressionof normal breast tissue remains dependent on endogenous estrogens after the meno-pause.

The study was designed as a two-phase approach. In the discovery phase, we compared breast genomic profiles of 37 parous with 18 nulliparous postmenopausal women. In the validation phase, confirmation of the genomic patterns observed in the discovery phase was sought in an independent set of 30 parous and 22 nulliparous postmenopausal women. RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG_U 133 Plus 2. 0 oligonucleotide arrays containing probes to 54, 675 transcripts, scanned and the images analyzed using Affymetrix GCOS software. Surrogate variable analysis, logistic regression, and significance analysis of microarrays were used to identify statistically significant differences in expression of genes. The false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to control for multiple comparisons. We found that 208 genes (305 probe sets) were differentially expressed between parous and nulliparous women in both discovery and validation phases of the study at an FDR of 10 % and with at least a 1. 25 -fold change. These genes are involved in regulation of transcription, centrosome organization, RNA splicing, cell-cycle control, adhesion, and differentiation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{majority}} of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women are asymptomatic, but may {{give rise to}} pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal infertility. Screening programmes aim at reducing morbidity in individuals by early detection and treatment, and at decreasing the overall prevalence of infection in the population. A number of modelling studies have tried to calculate the threshold prevalence of chlamydia lower genital tract infection above which screening becomes cost-effective. There is considerable debate over the exact complication rates after chlamydia infections, and more precise estimates of PID and tubal infertility are needed, for instance to be inserted in economic models. METHODS: With reference to key studies and systematic reviews, an overview is provided focusing on the epidemiology of chlamydia infection and the risk-estimates of its late complications. RESULTS: In the literature, the generally assumed risk of developing PID after lower genital tract chlamydia infection varies considerably, and is up to 30 %. For developing tubal infertility after PID the risks are 10 - 20 %. This implies {{that the risk of}} test-positive women of developing tubal infertility would range between 0. 1 and 6 %. We included chlamydia IgG antibody testing in a model and estimated a risk of tubal infertility up to 4. 6 %.

An overarching hierarchy of clinical evidence is introduced, and the relative strengths and limitations of the major types of study designs are discussed. A corollary to the hierarchy of evidence in trial designs is proposed for trial outcomes: the “pyramid of endpoints. ” This pyramid represents a spectrum of outcomes from tangible health events to <b>intermediate</b> <b>markers</b> with no direct physical impact on an individual. The potential advantages and difficulties inherent in the use of surrogate endpoints for final health outcomes are explored. Randomized controlled trials utilizing “hard” clinical endpoints are advocated as the most efficient and reliable way to directly assess the benefits and harms of a therapy; however, using a case study of treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma, we highlight the challenges that can complicate even the highest levels of evidence.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{major cause}} of death from cancer in the Western world. Approximately 70 % of CRC is {{associated}} with environmental factors, probably mainly the diet. There is interest in the potential protective role of fermented milks containing probiotic cultures against CRC. This article analyzes the existing data from human, animal, and in vitro studies that explore whether consumption of milks fermented with probiotic cultures could play a role in colon cancer risk reduction. Cohort studies have failed to detect significant effects, but most case-control studies favor a protective role of fermented milks against colon cancer. Interventional studies have shown a shift of <b>intermediate</b> <b>markers</b> of CRC risk in human subjects from a high- to low-risk pattern after ingestion of fermented milks or probiotics. Animal studies consistently show a reduction in chemically induced colorectal tumor incidence and aberrant crypt formation accompanying probiotic administration. In vitro studies also provide evidence of protection, and permit a better understanding of active compounds involved, and of the mechanisms underlying their anticarcinogenic effects. Probiotics may beneficially modulate several major intestinal functions: detoxification, colonic fermentation, transit, and immune status, which may accompany the development of colon cancer. Although the evidence is not conclusive and much further research is required, the data reviewed constitute a promising body of evidence supporting the protective role of milks fermented with probiotic cultures in colon cancer risk reduction...|$|R
40|$|Carcinogenesis {{proceeds}} {{through a}} very long preclinical period. Our collective hope is that multiple opportunities exist for chemoprevention to arrest or reverse progression towards malignancy. In the hope of faster progress with fewer subjects and lower total cost, much effort is being expended on the search for reliable biomarkers to predict the likelihood of developing cancer and/or to signal the effectiveness of chemopreventive therapy. Considerable {{attention is paid to}} identifying those markers that can act as surrogate markers for cancer development, since favorable modulation of the surrogate end-point biomarker (SEBM) may demonstrate effectiveness of a putative preventive treatment. However, the complexity of the biology challenges our ability to measure the effectiveness of attempts to arrest or reverse carcinogenesis, other than through costly and time-consuming prospective trials with disease state as the endpoint. Despite much work, to date no prehistologic biological or molecular <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> has been validated for sporadic cancers. Several factors accounting for the difficulties encountered in SEBM development are reviewed. Discussion is focused on the common thread of the complexity of the underlying biological changes in carcinogenesis limiting the effectiveness of any single biomarker. Additionally, the incidence of sporadic cancers is also low, further limiting the positive predictive value of any putative prognostic marker. Recent successes in development of chemopreventive agents show the concept is valid and worth pursuing, but the current strategies to develop biochemical and genetic markers to identify surrogate biomarkers is flawed, and need to be reassessed in light of the difficulties faced over the last 20 years...|$|E

Multiple regression analyses showed that birth weight decreased with 47 g (95 % CI: 16 - 78 g) for an interquartile range increase of 0. 99 mg/L arsenic. The model was adjusted for child's sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, and parity. Higher arsenic concentrations and reduced birth weight were positively associated with changes in expression of the sFLT 1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1) gene in cord blood cells in girls. The protein product of sFLT 1 is a scavenger of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the extracellular environment and {{plays a key role}} in the inhibition of placental angiogenesis. In terms of fetal development, inhibition of placental angiogenesis leads to impaired nutrition and hence to growth retardation. Various genes related to DNA methylation and oxidative stress showed also changed expression in relation to arsenic exposure but were not related to birth outcome parameters. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased expression of sFLT 1 is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> that points to placental angiogenesis as a pathway linking prenatal arsenic exposure to reduced birth weight...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women are asymptomatic, but may {{give rise to}} pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal infertility. Screening programmes aim at reducing morbidity in individuals by early detection and treatment, and at decreasing the overall prevalence of infection in the population. A number of modelling studies have tried to calculate the threshold prevalence of chlamydia lower genital tract infection above which screening becomes cost-effective. There is considerable debate over the exact complication rates after chlamydia infections, and more precise estimates of PID and tubal infertility are needed, for instance to be inserted in economic models. With reference to key studies and systematic reviews, an overview is provided focusing on the epidemiology of chlamydia infection and the risk-estimates of its late complications. In the literature, the generally assumed risk of developing PID after lower genital tract chlamydia infection varies considerably, and is up to 30 %. For developing tubal infertility after PID the risks are 10 - 20 %. This implies {{that the risk of}} test-positive women of developing tubal infertility would range between 0. 1 and 6 %. We included chlamydia IgG antibody testing in a model and estimated a risk of tubal infertility up to 4. 6 %. The risk of developing late complications after chlamydia lower genital tract infection appears low. High quality RCTs dealing with the transition from cervicitis to infertility are needed to broaden the evidence. In screening programmes, chlamydia antibody testing, as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>marker</b> for potential adverse sequelae, might enable more precise estimate...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Virgin {{olive oil}} (VOO) and nuts are basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, a heart-healthy dietary pattern. Nuts have well known cholesterol lowering effects, while evidence is unclear for VOO. We designed a study in hypercholesterolemic patients to assess the effects on serum lipids and other <b>intermediate</b> <b>markers</b> of cardiovascular risk of replacing 40 % of the fat in the background diet with VOO, walnuts or almonds. Methods and Results: After a 4 week run-in period with a healthy diet, eligible candidates were randomized into three diet sequences in a crossover design, with a common background diet enriched with VOO, walnuts or almonds, lasting 4 weeks each. Outcomes were changes of serum lipids and oxidation and inflammation markers, measured by standard methods. Plasma fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography to assess compliance. In 18 participants completing the study (9 women, mean age 56 y, BMI 25. 7 kg/m(2)), LDL-cholesterol was reduced from baseline by 7. 3 %, 10. 8 % and 13. 4 % after the VOO, walnut and almond diets, respectively (P = 0. 001, Friedman test). Total cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratios decreased in parallel. LDL-cholesterol decreases were greater than predicted from dietary fatty acid and cholesterol exchanges among diets. No changes of other lipid fractions, oxidation analytes or inflammatory biomarkers were observed. Plasma fatty acid changes after each diet sequence supported good compliance.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: To {{account for}} the dynamic aspects of carcinogenesis, we propose a compartmental hidden Markov model in which each person is healthy, asymptomatically affected, diagnosed, or deceased. Our model is {{illustrated}} using the example of smoking-induced lung cancer. METHODS:: The model was fitted on a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, including 757 incident cases and 1524 matched controls. Estimation was done through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and simulations based on the posterior estimates of the parameters were used to provide measures of model fit. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of our findings. RESULTS:: After adjusting for its impact on exposure duration, age was not found to independently drive the risk of lung carcinogenesis, whereas age at starting smoking in ever-smokers and time since cessation in former smokers {{were found to be}} influential. Our data did not support an age-dependent time to diagnosis. The estimated time between onset of malignancy and clinical diagnosis ranged from 2 to 4 years. Our approach yielded good performance in reconstructing individual trajectories in both cases (sensitivity > 90 %) and controls (sensitivity > 80 %). CONCLUSION:: Our compartmental model enabled us to identify time-varying predictors of risk and provided us with insights into the dynamics of smoking-induced lung carcinogenesis. Its flexible and general formulation enables the future incorporation of disease states, as measured by <b>intermediate</b> <b>markers,</b> into the modeling of the natural history of cancer, suggesting a large range of applications in chronic disease epidemiology.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2015. Background Impairments in key neuropsychological domains (e. g. working memory, attention) {{and social}} {{cognitive}} deficits have been implicated as intermediate (endo) phenotypes for bipolar disorder (BD), and {{should therefore be}} evident in unaffected relatives. Method Neurocognitive and social cognitive ability was examined in 99 young people (age range 16 - 30 years) with a biological parent or sibling diagnosed with the disorder [thus deemed {{to be at risk}} (AR) of developing BD], compared with 78 healthy control (HC) subjects, and 52 people with a confirmed diagnosis of BD. Results Only verbal intelligence and affective response inhibition were significantly impaired in AR relative to HC participants; the BD participants showed significant deficits in attention tasks compared with HCs. Neither AR nor BD patients showed impairments in general intellectual ability, working memory, visuospatial or language ability, relative to HC participants. Analysis of BD-I and BD-II cases separately revealed deficits in attention and immediate memory in BD-I patients (only), relative to HCs. Only the BD (but not AR) participants showed impaired emotion recognition, relative to HCs. Conclusions Selective cognitive deficits in the capacity to inhibit negative affective information, and general verbal ability may be <b>intermediate</b> <b>markers</b> of risk for BD; however, the extent and severity of impairment in this sample was less pronounced than has been reported in previous studies of older family members and BD cases. These findings highlight distinctions in the cognitive profiles of AR and BD participants, and provide limited support for progressive cognitive decline in association with illness development in BD...|$|R
