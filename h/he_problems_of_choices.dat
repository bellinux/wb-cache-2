40|$|Action Selection schemes, when {{translated}} into precise algorithms, typically involve considerable design effort and tuning of parameters. Little {{work has been}} done on solving the problem using learning. This paper compares eight different methods of solving the action selection problem using Reinforcement Learning (learning from rewards). The methods range from centralised and cooperative to decentralised and selfish. They are tested in an artificial world and their performance, memory requirements and reactiveness are compared. Finally, the possibility of more exotic, ecosystem-like decentralised models are considered. 1 Action Selection By Action Selection we do not mean the low-level <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> action in pursuit of a single coherent goal.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{proposes to}} analyze the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> land use and {{technology}} for forest regeneration with minimum adverse impacts on the ecosystem. As the nature <b>of</b> the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> such <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> land use and technology would depend upon the local characteristic of the ecosystem we propose {{to take up a}} case study through developing a model of analysis at the watershed level economies in the Himalayan mountains. The issue <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> which is involved in the analysis of the particular case study, is supposed to yield valuable analytical and policy insights, which can be generalized for rural situations with similar geomorphic, eco-regional and agro-climatic conditions. This work develops a quantitative optimization framework of analysis using the mathematical tool of linear programming for structuring and articulating the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> The modeling framework essentially focuses on optimal use of land and energy resources in two alternate exercises of net revenue maximization and cost minimization. The range of options that the model would attempt to articulate through the case study would cover the following aspects: (a) Use of land for agriculture, pasture and forestry including conversion from one use to the other.
