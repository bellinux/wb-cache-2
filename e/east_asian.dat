40|$|Behavioral and {{eye-tracking}} {{studies on}} cultural differences {{have found that}} while Westerners have a bias for analytic processing and attend more to face features, <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> are more holistic and attend more to contextual scenes.

Additionally, Westerners showed bilateral activity to faces in the FFA whereas <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> showed more right lateralization. In contrast, no cultural differences were detected in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), although there was a trend for <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> to show greater house selectivity than Westerners in the lingual landmark area, consistent with more holistic processing in <b>East</b> <b>Asians.</b> These findings demonstrate group biases in Westerners and <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> that operate on perceptual processing in the brain and are consistent with previous eye-tracking data that show cultural biases to faces...|$|R

These findings have often been explained as being due to corresponding differences in social orientation. Westerners are more independent and Easterners are more interdependent. However, comparisons of the cognitive tendencies of Westerners and <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> do not allow us to rule out alternative explanations for the cognitive differences, such as linguistic and genetic differences, as well as cultural differences other than social orientation. In this review we summarize recent developments that provide stronger support for the social-orientation hypothesis.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} genetic polymorphisms and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) -related cough, and the race- or ethnicity-related difference in the prevalence of cough attributed to ACEI therapy. METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Database without language limitation. A database of 11 studies on ACEI-related cough, with detailed information regarding ACE I/D or bradykinin B 2 receptor polymorphisms, was created. Eligible studies were synthesized using meta-analysis methods, including cumulative meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was also performed using ethnicity. RESULTS: Six studies were included on ACE I/D polymorphism (398 Caucasians, 723 <b>East</b> <b>Asians),</b> and three studies were included on bradykinin B 2 receptor polymorphism (300 <b>East</b> <b>Asians).</b> The distribution of ACE genotypes showed {{significant differences in the}} entire population (P = 0. 004) and in <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> (P = 0. 005) but not in Caucasians (P = 0. 23). Allelic frequencies of ACE showed significant differences in <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 49 (1. 11 - 2. 02) ]. The meta-analysis with a random effects model showed a significant association between ACE allele I/D and ACEI-related cough [random effects (RE) OR = 1. 49 (1. 11 - 2. 02), P = 0. 009] in <b>East</b> <b>Asians,</b> but not in Caucasians [RE OR = 0. 90 (0. 60 - 1. 35) ]. The allelic frequencies of the bradykinin B 2 receptor gene were significantly different [OR = 2. 25 (1. 42 - 3. 57) ]. The distributions of the T/C genotypes of the bradykinin B 2 receptor gene were significantly different (&#x 3 C 7; 2 = 8. 366, P = 0. 015). The meta-analyses revealed that there was a significant association between the bradykinin B 2 receptor allele and ACEI-related cough in <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> [RE OR = 2. 29 (1. 42 - 3. 69), P = 0. 001].

40|$|Background and {{objective}} The relationship between myeloperoxidase G- 463 A genetic polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility {{has been studied}} extensively. However, the outcomes are not consistent. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the relationship between myeloperoxidase genetic polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility by meta analysis. Methods Documents published were retrieved through databases associated with the study. Taking into account the possibilities of heterogeneity of the studies, a statistical test for heterngeneity was performed. The odds ratio and 95 %CI were used to evaluate the risks. The meta analysis was applied with RevMan software 4. 2, and the forest plot and funnel plot of meta analysis were worked out. Results A total of 5 381 cases and 5 827 controls from studies for Caucasian and a total of 1 558 cases and 1 755 controls from studies for <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> were included. For Caucasian the pooled OR was 0. 91 (95 %CI: 0. 81 - 1. 02); For <b>East</b> <b>Asians,</b> the pooled OR is 0. 83 (95 %CI: 0. 63 - 1. 09). Publication bias exits in the study for Caucasian, but not for <b>East</b> <b>Asians.</b> Conclusion The results of this study indicated that the polymorphism of myeloperoxidase G- 463 A was not significantly associated with the lung cancer risk for Caucasian or <b>East</b> <b>Asians.</b> However, further studies for the <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> is needed for the few subjects...|$|R
30|$|Mutations provide another {{mechanism}} for MET dysregulation. Mutated MET allows the kinase to overcome inhibitory mechanisms, thus becoming constructively activated or hyperresponsive to stimuli. Mutations could also prolong {{the duration of}} stimulating signals by increasing the level of activation or by preventing the degradation of the kinase. One study examined individual exons of semaphorin, juxtamembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains of MET in 141 <b>East</b> <b>Asians,</b> 76 Caucasians and 66 African Americans [65]. The results showed that MET mutations varied with ethnicity. N 375 S, occurred within the semaphorin domain, was the most frequent non-synonymous mutation, {{and the frequency of}} this mutation was higher in <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> compared to Caucasians. In both <b>East</b> <b>Asians</b> and Caucasians, the frequency of N 375 S was higher in squamous cell carcinoma than in other non-small cell lung cancer. Among <b>East</b> <b>Asians,</b> the frequency of N 375 S in males was much higher compared with females [65]. Since there is a relationship between ethnic differences and MET mutations, greater knowledge of this correlation can help us understand incidence, prognosis and treatment of lung cancer.|$|R
