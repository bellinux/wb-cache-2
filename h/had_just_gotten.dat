25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E
25|$|About 1pm, as Drake moved sluggishly {{out across}} Belfast Lough, {{a small boat}} came out to her, {{carrying}} another volunteer, Royal Navy Lieutenant William Dobbs, a local man who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> married. According to Drake pilot {{he brought with him}} a copy of an express letter from Whitehaven, explaining the full details of the mystery ship (Jones states in his official report that the news from Whitehaven had arrived the previous evening and was known to his morning captives). With the wind and tide more favourable in the afternoon, Ranger moved slowly back out of the Lough into the North Channel, making sure never to get too far ahead of Drake. Finally, about 6pm, the two enemies were within hailing distance. Jones had the American naval colours flying, and Lieut. Dobbs' formal inquiry as to the ship's identity was answered with absolute truth.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year's {{race was}} the last Giro to be run with a points system. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who won the sixth stage, and would come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani— who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War— won the event by six points over the second-place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi. The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification shift from a points system to a time based system. In the new system, every rider's finishing time for each stage is totaled together and the rider with the lowest total time is the overall leader. Out of the eighty-one riders entered the race only eight of them finished. The grueling race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second-place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I.|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they {{also served as}} the opening act for W.A.S.P.'s U.S. tour in 1987. In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I think I <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> married, and I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue the tour Slayer enlisted Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione.|$|E

Futterman noted that people <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> [...] "used {{to the idea of}} a well-played villain on the show", while Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times expressed doubt about a complete conversion: [...] "We'll see how long that lasts." [...] Slezak called him a [...] "gem when it comes to delivering spicy one-liners", though he was less enthusiastic about the character's vocal solos, as was Canning, who nevertheless hailed Sebastian as a [...] "fine nemesis".|$|E

After she leaves, Sean shows up to see his child, and they name the girl Alexandra. Later, Emma agrees to Graham's offer to become his deputy.

500|$|... "Don't Stop", {{written by}} Christine McVie, {{is a song}} about optimism. She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their {{personal}} sensibilities overlapped. McVie's next track, [...] "Songbird", features more introspective lyrics about [...] "nobody and everybody" [...] {{in the form of}} [...] "a little prayer". [...] "Oh Daddy", the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> back together. [...] The band's nickname for Fleetwood was [...] "The Big Daddy". McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer's direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks provided the final lines [...] "And I can't walk away from you, baby/If I tried". Her own song, [...] "Gold Dust Woman", is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a metropolis. After struggling with the rock lifestyle, Nicks became addicted to cocaine and the lyrics address her belief in [...] "keeping going".|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

Raine <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> back from Sudan, he was trying to compress all the things he’d experienced.

2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, Vaughan was longing {{to work on}} {{material}} for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny, which restricted him of any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song [...] "Crossfire" [...] with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: [...] "Basically, we wrote the music, {{and they had to}} write the lyrics. We <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> together; Stevie was unable to be there at that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote." [...] On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughan's last concert appearance in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|On September 27, 1927, {{a tornado}} struck St. Louis, {{including}} Central High School, killing 76 people and leaving 1,500 others injured in total. The tornado killed five students—they {{are listed in}} the 1928 Central yearbook on a page with a touching poem--- {{and more than a dozen}} were injured when the school's tower collapsed. The damage to the building was so great that the school was permanently relocated to nearby Yeatman High School, which was renamed Central High School. The building, located on Garrison Avenue, had been designed by William B. Ittner as a three-story all-brick building with two towers at its entrance, and it would continue to house Central students through 2004. [...] It has long been forgotten that the Central student body and faculty had just returned to the Grand Avenue building FROM Yeatman High School, where the school had been housed two years while the Grand Avenue building underwent an extensive renovation and updating. [...] School <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>gotten</b> underway back at the Central building when the tornado struck. [...] Everyone and everything had to be moved back to Yeatman. [...] It's also been long forgotten that one wall of the school eventually built on the Central site, the factory-like and uniquely conceived Hadley Vocational High School, was a wall preserved from the Central building.|$|E
