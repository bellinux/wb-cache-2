40|$|Abstract Background Computer-based {{teaching}} (CBT) is {{a well-known}} educational device, but {{it has never been}} applied systematically to the teaching of a complex, rare, genetic disease, such as <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> (MPS II). Aim To develop interactive teaching software functioning as a virtual clinic for the management of MPS II. Implementation and Results The <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> eClinic, a self-training, user-friendly educational software program, available at the Lysosomal Storage Research Group ([URL]), was developed using the Adobe Flash multimedia platform. It was designed to function both to provide a realistic, interactive virtual clinic and instantaneous access to supporting literature on <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease.</b> The <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> eClinic consists of an eBook and an eClinic. The eClinic is the interactive virtual clinic component of the software. Within an environment resembling a real clinic, the trainee is instructed to perform a medical history, to examine the patient, and to order appropriate investigation. The program provides clinical data derived from the management of actual patients with <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease.</b> The eBook provides instantaneous, electronic access to a vast collection of reference information to provide detailed background clinical and basic science, including relevant biochemistry, physiology, and genetics. In the eClinic, the trainee is presented with quizzes designed to provide immediate feedback on both trainee effectiveness and efficiency. User feedback on the merits of the program was collected at several seminars and formal clinical rounds at several medical centres, primarily in Canada. In addition, online usage statistics were documented for a 2 -year period. Feedback was consistently positive and confirmed the practical benefit of the program. The online English-language version is accessed daily by users from all over the world; a Japanese translation of the program is also available. Conclusions The <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> eClinic employs a CBT model providing the trainee with realistic clinical problems, coupled with comprehensive basic and clinical reference information by instantaneous access to an electronic textbook, the eBook. The program was rated highly by attendees at national and international presentations. It provides a potential model for use as an educational approach to other rare genetic diseases. </p...|$|E

Pedigree analysis, and the normal iduronate sulphatase activity in the mother's fibroblasts, serum, and hair roots indicate that the affected child represents a new mutation. Since the parents' karyotypes are normal, it seems that the translocation disrupted the iduronate sulphatase gene itself, thus mapping this to Xq 26 - 27 for the first time.

40|$|Background: Molecular {{investigations}} of iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (IDS) mutants for the X-linked lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease),</b> commonly depends on transient expression studies to verify a single nucleotide change to be pathogenic. In 2 severely affected patients, IDS missense mutations, c. 1016 T>C (novel) and c. 1016 T>G (known) were identified predicting {{the substitution of}} an ambivalent cyclic proline and a hydrophilic arginine respectively for the hydrophobic leucine at residue 339. We hypothesized that residue Leu 339 may be functionally critical. Methods: We performed a study for the 2 mutations by in-situ mutagenesis, in vitro expression, and functional analysis. Results: Transient expression revealed that both the missense variants had stable mRNA but their residual enzyme activities remained < 2. 5 % of normal level. The effect of the missense mutations on protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis. Both the missense mutations synthesized the precursor form but had reduced mature form of IDS. Conclusion: The novel mutation p. L 339 P is a disease-causing mutation affecting maturation of the protein. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Enzyme replacement therapies for diseases of inherited metabolic enzyme deficiency provide an example of this dilemma. The Ontario Public Drug Programs convened the Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group to develop a policy for assessing these drugs. MethodsThe Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group developed terms of reference expecting that the ideal policy product would be transparent and consistent and address unique aspects of the treatment of a specific rare condition while being adaptable to other dissimilar conditions. The perspective was that of a public payer addressing requests for funding generated for a specific drug, and included respect for the principles of “accountability for reasonableness” of Daniels and Sabin. ResultsA seven-step framework was developed and tested by using the case study of idursulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis II (<b>Hunter</b> <b>disease).</b> Estimation of clinical effectiveness was done by using decision modeling.

40|$|Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome) is X-linked {{recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder {{resulting from}} the defective activity of the enzyme iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (IDS). <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> can vary from mild to severe, depending {{on the level of}} enzyme deficiency. We report the IDS mutation and polymorphisms causing the Hunter syndrome in patients from one family in Tunisia Patients and methods A preliminary diagnosis was made by qualitative detection of urinary glycosaminoglycans of the suspected MPS II probands. The IDS mutation and polymorphisms were determined on these probands and their family members by amplifying and sequencing each of the exons and intron-exon junctions of IDS gene. Results The studied probands were homoallelic for p. R 88 P mutation. In addition, three known polymorphisms/sequence variants: IVS 3 - 16 (c. 419 - 16 delT), T 214 M (c. 641 C > T), T 146 T (c. 438 C > T), IVS 5 - 87 (c. 709 - 87 G > A) and one previously unknown: IVS 7 + 38 (c. 1006 + 38 T > C were identified in the MPS II patients. These are the first Tunisian MPS II patients to be genotyped. Conclusion The identification of these mutation and polymorphisms and their genotype-phenotype correlation should facilitate prenatal diagnosis and counseling for MPS II in Tunisia, where a very high rate of consanguinity exists. </p...|$|E

40|$|Lysosomes are organelles ubiquitously {{distributed}} in most eukaryotic cells. They are spherical particles with {{a diameter of}} 0. 5 – 1. 5 microns. The pH in them is low (~pH 5. 0) and they contain many acid hydrolases that take part in protein degradation in the cell. Lysosomes also contain lipases, polysaccharidases, and nucleases. Deficiencies {{in some of these}} enzymes lead to specific lysosomal storage diseases, 1, 2 such as Tay Sachs, Gaucher, and <b>Hunter</b> <b>diseases.</b> Lysosomes also contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and thus, malfunctions in this organelle will have a direct impact on cell behavior and fate. 3 Lysosomes may also be involved in other cellular processes such as Albinism 4 and aging. 5, 6 The Lysosome Isolation Kit provides a procedure for isolating an enriched lysosomal fraction from animal tissues and cultured cells by differential centrifugation followed by density gradient centrifugation and/or calcium precipitation. The presence of lysosomes can be determined by measuring the acid phosphatase activity with the Acid Phosphatase Assay Kit (Catalog Number CS 0740) or the b-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity with the b-N-Acetylglucosaminidase Assay Kit (Catalog Number CS 0780).

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are {{inherited}} metabolic disorders {{from the}} group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). They arise from mutations causing dysfunction of one of enzymes involved in degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. Impaired degradation of these compounds results in their accumulation in cells and dysfunction of most tissues and organs of patients. If heparan sulfate (HS) is the sole or one of stored GAGs, brain functions are also affected. However, {{despite the fact that}} products of incomplete degradation of the same chemical, HS, are accumulated in brains of patients suffering from Hurler disease (MPS type I), <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> (MPS type II), Sanfilippo disease (MPS type III) and Sly disease (MPS type VII), and obvious deterioration of brain functions occur in these patients, their behavior is considerably different between various types of MPS. Here we asked the question about biochemical reasons of these differences. We performed theoretical analysis of products of incomplete HS degradation that accumulate in tissues of patients diagnosed for these diseases. A correlation between chemical structures of incompletely degraded HS and behaviors of patients suffering from particular MPS types was found. We propose a hypothesis that particular chemical moieties occurring at the ends of incompletely degraded HS molecules may determine characteristic behavioral disturbances, perhaps due to chemical reactions interfering with functions of neurons in the brain. A possible experimental testing of this hypothesis is also proposed. If the hypothesis is true, it might shed some new light on biochemical mechanisms of behavioral problems occurring not only in MPS but also in some other diseases...|$|E

Most of them (11) started ERT in 2006, 3 had started it earlier in 2004, enrolled in the phase III trial, and 3 after 2006, as soon as the diagnosis was made. The liver and spleen sizes and urinary GAGs significantly decreased and normalized throughout the treatment. Heart parameters improved, in particular the left ventricular mass index/m 2 decreased significantly. Amelioration of hearing was seen in many patients. Joint range of motion improved in all patients. However, no improvement on respiratory function, eye, skeletal and CNS disease was found. The developmental quotient of patients with a CNS involvement showed a fast decline. These patients were no more testable after 6  years of age and, albeit the benefits drawn from ERT, their quality of life worsened throughout the years.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPSII or Hunter Syndrome) is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{caused by}} the deficit of iduronate 2 -sulfatase (IDS) activity and characterized by progressive systemic and neurological impairment. As the early mechanisms leading to neuronal degeneration remain elusive, we chose to examine the properties of neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from an animal model of the disease in order to evaluate whether their neurogenic potential {{could be used to}} recapitulate the early phases of neurogenesis in the brain of <b>Hunter</b> <b>disease</b> patients. Experiments here reported show that NSCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of early symptomatic IDS-knockout (IDS-ko) mouse retained self-renewal capacity in vitro, but differentiated earlier than wild-type (wt) cells, displaying an evident lysosomal aggregation in oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. Consistently, the SVZ of IDS-ko mice appeared similar to the wt SVZ, whereas the cortex and striatum presented a disorganized neuronal pattern together with a significant increase of glial apoptotic cells, suggesting that glial degeneration likely precedes neuronal demise. Interestingly, a very similar pattern was observed in the brain cortex of a Hunter patient. These observations both in vitro, in our model, and in vivo suggest that IDS deficit seems to affect the late phases of neurogenesis and/or the survival of mature cells rather than NSC self-renewal. In particular, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive (PDGFR-α+) glial progenitors appeared reduced in both the IDS-ko NSCs and in the IDS-ko mouse and human Hunter brains, compared with the respective healthy controls. Treatment of mutant NSCs with IDS or PDGF throughout differentiation was able {{to increase the number of}} PDGFR-α+ cells and to reduce that of apoptotic cells to levels comparable to wt.

Methods: Peripheral leucocytes were collected from the patients and the IDS gene was amplified to looking for the variations. For a female patient, the X chromosome status was analyzed by androgen receptor X-inactivation assay and the mutation impact on RNA level was further performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: We discovered that point mutations constituted the major form while mutations in codon p. R 468 defined the largest number of patients in our cohort.

We further performed SNP-array to delineate the deletion breakpoints and to characterize the deletion extension in the different patients. the results indicated a similar to 9. 4 ?Mb deletion in Patient 1, a similar to 3. 9 ?Mb deletion of the Xq 27. 3 Xq 28 and a similar to 3. 1 ?Mb duplication of the X q 28 region in Patient 2 and a similar to 41. 8 ?Kb deletion in Patient 3. SNP-array was shown to be important to map for deletion breakpoints. A comprehensive molecular analysis in patients with Hunter syndrome, especially in the ones presenting the severe form, is important {{to the understanding of the}} genetic determinants of the phenotype and for the genetic counseling to be provided to the families.

40|$|Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is {{the most}} common {{therapeutic}} strategy applied to several Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) including Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), as MPS type I (MPS I, Hurler Disease) and type II (MPS II, <b>Hunter</b> <b>Disease).</b> Both diseases are characterized by a totally or partially defective activity of lysosomal enzymes involved in the catabolism of the mucopolysaccharides (or glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) heparan- and dermatan-sulfate which therefore heavily accumulate within cellular compartment and in the extracellular matrix. Although presenting several forms of clinical severity and disease progression, both pathologies affect most of the organ systems, are mostly life-threatening and about two-thirds of the patients also present neurological and cognitive impairment. Enzyme Replacement Therapy, applied to both diseases in the last few years, has shown to determine some clinical improvements, but it has also shown some limitations. In addition to the elevated costs of intervention, ERT presents the need of weekly administrations in a day-hospital regimen, this reducing patients’compliance, and the inefficacy of the recombinant enzymes in treating the CNS impairment due to their inability in blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing. Thus, we combined the experience of clinical-based skills with pharmaceutical nanotechnology-based skills in order to create nanocarriers, biodegradable and biocompatible, able to deliver the recombinant enzymes across the BBB and to both assure a prolonged drug circulation and release, and a protection from metabolic drug inactivation. With this aim, we produced polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) modified with 7 -aminoacid glycopeptides (g 7), yet demonstrated to be able to drive the NPs across the BBB after administration in rodents. Before going into functional and efficacy study, we developed several preliminary experiments in order to explore the ability of PLGA-NPs in transferring across the BBB a model drug (FITC-albumin), with a high molecular weight, comparable to that of the enzymes to be delivered across the BBB. In vivo experiments on both WT and knock-out (KO) mouse models for MPS I and MPS II were performed by i. v. -injecting g 7 -NPs loaded with FICT-albumin together with a plethora of control samples (i. e-. un-modified NPs, FITC-albumin solution) {{in order to have a}} broad preliminary view. The results clearly showed that g 7 -NPs are able to cross the BBB in all treated mice (WT and KO models) and to deliver FITC-albumin to the brain; interestingly, we found qualitative and semi-quantitative evidences of a higher grade of brain accumulation of g 7 -NPs loaded with Albumin in the KO -brains with respect to WT ones. Taken together, these results pave the way to a possible successful set of pilot experiments on the ability of enzyme-loaded g 7 -NPs to deliver sufficient amount of the drug to the brain district, hopefully exerting a corrective effect on the pathological cellular GAG deposits...|$|E
5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba.

30|$|As water {{scarcity}} is increasing worldwide, water-related diseases are increasing, especially {{in developing countries}} (Hunter et al. 2010). A recent study in India showed that domestic {{water scarcity}} is strongly associated with various kinds of health damage caused by infectious diseases (Motoshita et al. 2011). Increased flooding as well as drought result in {{a decline in the}} availability of clean water. In Bangladesh, waterborne diseases are already responsible for 24 % of all deaths (Reid and Sims 2007). Increased unavailability of freshwater forces people to drink contaminated water leading to dysentery, diarrhea, and other waterborne <b>diseases.</b> <b>Hunter</b> et al. (2010) indicated that inadequate access to safe drinking water is also associated with several non-diarrhea and noninfectious diseases.|$|R
50|$|Synageva’s other {{pipeline}} programs {{consisted of}} protein therapeutic programs for rare diseases with unmet medical need {{at various stages}} of development, including a Phase 1/2 trial with its second, first-mover program, SBC-103 for MPS IIIB. The company’s third, first-mover program, SBC-105, was an enzyme replacement therapy in preclinical development for disorders of calcification. In addition to these first-mover programs, Synageva’s pipeline also consisted of opportunities that leveraged the company’s EW manufacturing platform and other capabilities to create potentially bio-superior treatments for patient populations where there is still unmet medical need. The company was able to produce enzymes targeting <b>Hunter</b> syndrome, Fabry <b>disease</b> and Pompe disease with expression levels and activity that supported further preclinical development.|$|R
