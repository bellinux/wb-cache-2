Assessment was by pre-operative and postoperative grading of function in work and sport, {{together with a}} subjective <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> based on stability. Fifteen knees had collateral repairs, seven had cruciate repairs and 41 had combined collateral and cruciate repairs.

50|$|In another {{experiment}} {{a simple}} {{version of the}} “travelling salesman problem” was “solved”. For this purpose, different DNA-fragments were created, {{each one of them}} representing a city that had to be visited. Every one of these fragments is capable of a linkage with the other fragments created. These DNA-fragments were produced and mixed in a test tube. Within seconds, the small fragments form bigger ones, representing the different travel routes. Through a chemical reaction (that lasts a few days), the DNA-fragments representing the longer routes were eliminated. The remains are the solution to the problem. However, current technical limitations prevent <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> Therefore, the experiment isn’t suitable for application, but it is nevertheless a proof of concept.|$|E

50|$|In April 2016, {{attacks on}} all RMS {{implementations}} (including Azure RMS) were found and disclosed to Microsoft. These attacks allow a user {{with only the}} right to view on an RMS protected document {{to remove the protection}} permanently and preserve the file formatting. In addition, every user with the right to view on a protected document can manipulate the content of the document without leaving traces of the manipulation. Although preventing the removal of the RMS protection is not possible, it can be made harder for an attacker to succeed. The manipulation of a protected document on the other hand can be prevented, but has not yet (August 2016) been fixed.
