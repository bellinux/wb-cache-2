5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>species</b> {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>species</b> {{that have}} been {{identified}} as having lived in Lake Cahuilla include Cyprinodon macularius, Elops affinis, Gila elegans, Gila cypha, Gila robusta, Mugil cephalus, Ptychocheilus lucius, and Xyrauchen texanus.

5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in <b>fish</b> <b>species.</b> Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
