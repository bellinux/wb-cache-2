50|$|<b>Fluparoxan</b> showed α2-adrenoceptors {{antagonist}} {{activity in}} vivo in several animal species. In the conscious mouse, <b>fluparoxan</b> was effective by the oral route in preventing clonidine-induced hypothermia and antinociception. While in the rat the marked impairment of rotarod performance were prevented dose-dependently by <b>fluparoxan.</b> <b>Fluparoxan,</b> orally prevented agonist UK-14304 induced sedation and bradycardia in a dose-related fashion in the dog. <b>Fluparoxan</b> {{has been shown}} to possess central α2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, significantly attenuating all responses to the agonist clonidine (growth hormone secretion, bradycardia, hypotension, xerostomia) apart from the measures of sedation.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} chiral isomers 7 (+) 3aR,9aR and 8 (-) 3aS,9aS of <b>fluparoxan</b> {{both had}} comparable levels of α2-adrenoceptors antagonist potency and α2/α1 selectivity to racemic <b>fluparoxan</b> 6 (±) rel 3aR,9aR in vitro {{and a similar}} potency in vivo in reversing the hypothermia induced in mice by clonidine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluparoxan</b> {{is a very}} {{selective}} α2-adrenergic blocker, that readily {{cross the}} blood-brain barrier. Blockade of α2-adrenoreceptors, particularly presynaptic autoreceptors in noradrenergic neurons by <b>fluparoxan,</b> produces {{an increase in the}} synaptic concentrations of noradrenaline, by blocking the autoinhibitory feedback mechanism. This release of noradrenaline has a potential value in the treatment of disorders which are associated with a deficiency of noradrenaline at postsynaptic adrenoreceptors, such as depression, the early features of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cognitive impairment. <b>Fluparoxan</b> also exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, alpha1-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic or 5-HT1-receptor-blocking effects.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fluparoxan</b> has rat {{and human}} protein binding of 81-92% and 95% respectively. <b>Fluparoxan</b> shows high in vitro {{permeability}} in MCDK (Papp nm/s =2500) and Caco-2 (Papp nm/s =2000) cells which correlates {{well with the}} known high oral intestinal absorption (100%) in humans.Fluparoxan is well absorbed following oral dosing in all animals. Clearance was largely metabolic, with both oral and intravenous doses being excreted mainly via the urine (> 90%, of administered dose), chiefly as phase II metabolites (sulphamic acid and carbamoyI glucuronide conjugates). <b>Fluparoxan</b> has high oral bioavailability (100%) and a long duration of action (2hr) in the rat, which accounts for its similar potency seen by both the oral and intravenous routes of administration in this species. [...] The excellent pharmacokinetics exhibited by <b>fluparoxan</b> in animals also translated into man [...] where it has a superior bioavailability (97%) and longer duration of action (6-7hrs).|$|E
50|$|Racemic (±) <b>fluparoxan</b> 6 {{was first}} {{synthesised}} by a convergent route, which involved converting the bis-benzyl ether of cis-butene-l,4-diol 1 into its epoxide 2 followed by acid catalyzed ring opening to a racemic-diol {{which was then}} converted into the racemic trans bis-tosylate 3. Coupling 3-fluorocatechol 4 with the racemic trans bis-tosylate 3 in the presence base gave on deprotection the benzodioxan diol 5 which was converted to racemic 6 via coupling its bis-mesylate to benzylamine followed by deprotection.The individual chiral isomers (+) 7 and (-) 8 of <b>fluparoxan</b> were originally prepared from the (+) and (-) isomers of diethyl tartrate via the corresponding chiral trans bis-tosylates in a convergent route similar to that shown in the synthesis of racemic <b>fluparoxan.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluparoxan</b> {{has shown}} {{positive}} {{effects in the}} treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients when orally dosed with <b>fluparoxan,</b> and {{in the treatment of}} central neurodegenerative disorders in models of Alzheimer's disease where it prevented age-related decline in spatial working memory in transgenic mice, although it had no effect in other memory tasks such as object recognition or the Morris water maze and occurred in the absence of obvious concomitant change in pathology such as β-amyloid plaque load and astrocytosis.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>fluparoxan</b> {{has been}} shown to possess central α2-adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, clinical evaluation in depression and its development for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction was discontinued in the early 1990s when the compound failed to show a clear clinical advantage over existing therapies. The same is true for other α2-adrenoceptor antagonists in depression and it is now generally agreed that the original hypothesis that blocking α2-presynaptic adrenoceptors to increase brain levels of noradrenalin is insufficient as a neurobiological basis for depressive disorders, with the true picture likely to be much more complex and heterogeneous, involving both monoaminergic and nonmonoaminergic players. In contrast however, recent interest in <b>fluparoxan</b> has increased with its positive effects in treating cognitive dysfunction in central neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E
5000|$|Racemic (±) <b>fluparoxan</b> 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} powder as the hydrochloride hemihydrate m.p. 245 °C. [...] It {{is a mixture of}} two enantiomers and is moderately lipophilic (log P = 1.2) with good solubility 80 mg/mL in water at 25 °C. The compound is very stable in the solid state and its bioavailability from tablet formulation is 85% and absorption is rapid.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fluparoxan</b> was not metabolised {{by human}} {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes CYP 1A and CYP 2A, {{and was found}} {{not to be a}} mutagen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes and did not cause gene mutation when administered to Chinese hamster fibroblasts in culture. No mutagenic potential was identified in microbiological mutagenicity tests including a fluctuation test with S9 activation. No hydroxylated metabolites were identified after incubation with rat liver microsomes (S9) or in rat urine following oral dosing. [...] The compound was well tolerated on repeat oral administration to rat (≤ 200 mg /kg/day) and dog (≤ 80 mg/kg/day) for 12 months.|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by Ap plaque formation, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Current therapies for AD do not modify disease {{progression}} therefore, putative anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents {{need to be}} assessed in rodent in vivo models that demonstrate robust and reproducible markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This thesis interrogated the development of in vivo models comprising markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in rodent brain. The overview describes innate immunity focusing on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a standard immunostimulant followed by a review of AD and beta amyloid (Ap). Current rodent in vivo models of LPS or AP-induced neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration are also examined. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the novel application of Luminex suspension bead array systems {{for the detection of}} LPS-induced cytokine and other intracellular proteins in brain tissue. Intraperitoneal LPS modulated interleukin (IL) -lp, phosphorylated (p) -IicBa, p-p 38 kinase and p-JNK protein and intracerebroventricular LPS increased IL-ip, IL-la and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a protein in rat brain. Cytokine protein in rat brain was abrogated by dexamethasone and the a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>fluparoxan.</b> Subsequent chapters investigate more disease relevant models of Ap-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration detected by immunohistochemistry, Taqman or Luminex techniques. Chapter 4 discussed the assessment, by western blotting, of Ap forms expelled from apparatus commonly used to inject solutions into rodent brain tissue and identifying the most consistent method of Ap delivery. Subsequent studies revealing inconsistent neurotoxicity but robust neuroinflammation following intra-hippocampal injection of Ap were described. Final chapters focus on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration following peripheral insult (LPS or the noradrenergic neurotoxin, DSP- 4) to amyloid precursor protein (APP) / presenilin 1 (PS 1) transgenic mice. Peripheral administration of LPS or DSP- 4 modulated markers of neuroinflammation and did not initiate neurodegeneration. The implications of the current data on the future development of in vivo models are discussed in the final chapter...|$|E
