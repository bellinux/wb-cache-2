5|$|Ambassador Bishop {{requested}} an <b>evacuation</b> of the American {{community on}} 1 January, {{indicating that the}} <b>evacuation</b> could be with the planned Italian, French, or German <b>evacuation</b> efforts, but preferred an <b>evacuation</b> by the US military. The State Department authorized the <b>evacuation</b> on 2 January and on that day, Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an <b>evacuation</b> by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit. Ambassador Bishop had spent {{a considerable amount of}} time discussing contingency plans for <b>evacuation</b> with other diplomatic posts. Ultimately, ten heads of missions—eight ambassadors and two chargés d'affaires—along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The <b>evacuation</b> {{proceeded}} without {{interference from}} the PAVN. Aircraft flying air {{cover for the}} <b>evacuation</b> reported being tracked with surface to air radar {{in the vicinity of}} Bien Hoa Air Base (which had fallen to the PAVN on 25 April), but there were no missile launches. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the <b>evacuation</b> would lessen the risk of American intervention, had apparently instructed General Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Members of the police in Saigon had been promised <b>evacuation</b> in exchange for protecting the American <b>evacuation</b> buses and control of the crowds in the city during the <b>evacuation.</b> Disgruntled ARVN troops repeatedly hit American helicopters with small arms fire throughout the <b>evacuation,</b> without causing serious damage. Despite receiving sporadic NVA AAA fire, USAF and USN aircraft made no attacks on AAA or SAM sites during the <b>evacuation.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Evacuation</b> orders {{began on}} September 16, when {{officials}} issued a voluntary <b>evacuation</b> for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, {{all of which}} but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from Cape Fear northward were under a mandatory <b>evacuation.</b> A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the Outer Banks and 77% of residents in storm surge-prone areas of the Pamlico Sound did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory <b>evacuation.</b> The two primary reasons stated for the residents' <b>evacuation</b> decisions were the hurricane's strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official <b>evacuation</b> notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A {{majority of the respondents}} to the survey who heard the <b>evacuation</b> notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative's house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to Virginia. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative's house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing <b>evacuation</b> orders, the duration of the <b>evacuation</b> process varied between 3hours to 12hours in Dare County. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.|$|E
40|$|Historical runup {{data for}} the Hawaiian Islands {{indicate}} that <b>evacuations</b> of only limited coastal areas, rather than statewide <b>evacuations,</b> may be appropriate for some small tsunamis originating along the Kamchatka, Aleutian, and Alaskan portion of the circum-Pacific arc. With such limited <b>evacuations</b> most statewide activities can continue {{with little or no}} disruptions, saving millions in lost revenues and overtime costs, and maintaining or enhancing credibility in state and federal agencies. However, such <b>evacuations</b> are contingent upon accurate real-time modeling of the maximum expected runup values. Also, data indicate that such <b>evacuations</b> may not be appropriate for small Chilean tsunamis. Furthermore, data from other regions are thus far too limited for an evaluation of the appropriateness of partial <b>evacuations</b> for small tsunamis from those regions...|$|R
50|$|Voluntary <b>evacuations</b> of Jefferson and Orange Counties {{started on}} August 30 with {{mandatory}} <b>evacuations</b> {{in the two}} counties started on August 31. Also, the Texas Governor deployed other assets to help handle the oncoming disaster.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{flooding}} events in Tycannah Creek. During February 2012, heavy rainfall in the upper catchment of Tycannah Creek lead to the <b>evacuations</b> of 12 people {{in the village of}} Terry Hie Hie. Flooding leading to <b>evacuations</b> also occurred in November 2011.|$|R
5|$|<b>Evacuation</b> plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter <b>evacuation.</b> As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter <b>evacuation</b> and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed <b>evacuation</b> of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, {{the main}} and {{emergency}} spillways failed, leading to the <b>evacuation</b> of 188,000 people living near the dam. After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam's reservoir dropped below {{the top of the}} emergency spillway, the <b>evacuation</b> order was lifted.|$|E
5|$|On 28 April, Tan Son Nhut Air Base (lying {{adjacent}} to the airport) came under artillery fire and attack from Vietnamese People's Air Force aircraft. The fixed-wing <b>evacuation</b> was terminated and Operation Frequent Wind commenced. The <b>evacuation</b> took place primarily from the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) compound, beginning around 14:00 {{on the afternoon of}} 29 April, and ending that night with only limited small arms damage to the helicopters. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was intended to only be a secondary <b>evacuation</b> point for embassy staff, but it was soon overwhelmed with evacuees and desperate South Vietnamese. The <b>evacuation</b> of the embassy was completed at 07:53 on 30 April, but some Americans chose to stay or were left behind and some 400 third country nationals were left at the embassy.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Emergency Management Agency was {{activated}} on September 15, {{about three}} days prior to Isabel making landfall and entering the state. Officials in Hampton issued the first mandatory <b>evacuation</b> in the state on September 17, about 35hours prior to landfall. Elevenhours later, a mandatory <b>evacuation</b> was issued for some residents in Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, with a recommended <b>evacuation</b> for some residents {{in the city of}} Suffolk and Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Richmond, and York counties. Later on September 17 Governor Mark Warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory. By the time Isabel entered Virginia late on September 18, evacuations were also issued for Accomack County, Chincoteague, Gloucester County, Lancaster County, Mathews County, Newport News, Poquoson, Portsmouth, and Westmoreland County. The zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts, in areas prone to flooding, potentially affected by storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane, low-lying areas, health care facilities, or islands. The tools officials used to determine the <b>evacuation</b> zones included shelter locations, the SLOSH storm surge model, <b>evacuation</b> maps, and clearance times.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} <b>evacuation</b> points chosen for Operation Frequent Wind were the DAO Compound {{adjacent}} to Tan Son Nhut Airport for American and Vietnamese civilian evacuees, and the US Embassy, Saigon for Embassy staff. The {{plan for the}} <b>evacuation</b> included buses positioned at 28 buildings throughout metropolitan Saigon designated as pick-up points, with American civilian bus drivers standing by at those buildings. The buses would follow one of four planned <b>evacuation</b> routes from downtown Saigon to the DAO Compound, each route named after a Western Trail: Santa Fe, Oregon, Texas, etc.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 482,678individuals were {{directly}} affected by the storm. According to press reports, 12,076families in six provinces lost their homes. Nearly 40,000persons were rendered as homeless. In all, Typhoon Irma destroyed or damaged 119,233houses. A total of 24,137families or 141,974persons left their homes, 57,198 of which fled to <b>evacuation</b> centers because of flash flooding. The aforementioned <b>evacuation</b> camps included schools, town halls, and churches. Overall, damage totaled to $63.3million, including $41.8million from infrastructure. Crop damage was minimal, estimated at $10million. Furthermore, 595people were killed because of Irma. Seventy-two others were wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued <b>evacuation</b> warnings.

Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E

5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the <b>evacuation</b> was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the <b>evacuation</b> helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 29 April, Major General Smith advised Ambassador Martin that {{fixed-wing}} evacuations should cease {{and that}} Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter <b>evacuation</b> of US personnel and at-risk Vietnamese should commence. Ambassador Martin {{refused to accept}} General Smith's recommendation and instead insisted on visiting Tan Son Nhut to survey the situation for himself. At 10:00 Ambassador Martin confirmed General Smith's assessment and at 10:48 he contacted Washington to recommend Option 4, the helicopter <b>evacuation.</b> Finally at 10:51 the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Option 4; due to confusion {{in the chain of}} command, General Carey did not receive the execute order until 12:15. At 08:00 Lieutenant General Minh, commander of the VNAF and 30 of his staff arrived at the DAO compound demanding <b>evacuation,</b> signifying the complete loss of VNAF command and control.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a desire {{on the part of}} Soviet {{officials}} to forestall any <b>evacuations</b> until it was absolutely necessary, the marching orders were often to continue factory production until the eve of occupation before hurriedly dismantling and transporting factory equipment, and destroying what couldn't be moved in time. As a result of the delay in <b>evacuations,</b> they were often carried out under German aerial bombardment, which led to additional confusion among the frightened citizenry. Historian Rebecca Manley describes these early <b>evacuations</b> as being charactered by “three phenomena: the 'flight' of officials, the flight of the population, and 'panic'”.|$|R

Voluntary <b>evacuation</b> orders were also given to residents living in low-lying areas along the coastline. Although no plans {{were put in place}} to open shelters, the Emergency Operations Center in Washington County raised their activation level to stage two. In Franklin County, the Emergency Operations Center was placed at stage three and voluntary <b>evacuation</b> orders were issued for Alligator Point. After an afternoon briefing, officials in Walton County declared a State of Emergency based on available information on the storm.
