5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

[...] According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, at this point the cast was up in arms over de Mille's treatment of them. [...] James Mitchell, one of the dancers in the production, later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors, as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part, and dancers do not.|$|E

Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care.

[...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{credits include}} Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, {{and a regular}} at Abbey Road. [...] She had worked on pop {{material}} and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. [...] The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> should do. [...] Gilmour {{was in charge of}} the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. [...] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. [...] For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. [...] The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [...] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.|$|E

She claimed that, while Headstrong (2007) allowed her to [...] "learn [...] as an artist", with her second album, Guilty Pleasure (2009), she knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to do as an artist.

She often co-writes the songs she records; for her debut album Headstrong, she had writing credits in four songs, while she co-wrote five tracks for her album Guilty Pleasure. The songs in which she has songwriting credits are often personal. In 2009, while discussing the songs she co-wrote for her second studio album, Tisdale said that [...] "a lot of the songs on the album [...] about survival and staying strong" [...] and that she wanted those songs to be [...] "a statement and a reflection of what [...] through over the past year and how [...] grown up."

Langford wrote on his plea agreement form: [...] "In 1985, meetings were held at the Rancho [...] Rajneesh ... at which time the possible killing of the United States Attorney for Oregon was discussed. I participated in a number of these meetings and agreed with others to work toward that object." [...] Prosecutor Timothy J. Reardon III stated that Langford had been a member of the Rajneesh commune in Oregon since it began in 1981, and that the government was able to prove he joined the murder conspiracy at a point in time after May 25, 1985. Reardon said that Langford was a member of a group called the [...] "Circle of 38", which was the personal security force that guarded Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, and that he had served as a weapons instructor and policeman at the commune. Langford told U.S. District Judge Malcolm F. Marsh that he had suggested that guns for the murder conspiracy could be bought in Texas, instructed the conspiractors about silencers, took responsibility for the weapons while they were in the commune, and disposed of them when members of the murder conspiracy decided to flee the U.S. for Europe.
