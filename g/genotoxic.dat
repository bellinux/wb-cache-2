5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or <b>genotoxic,</b> in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and <b>genotoxic</b> {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or <b>genotoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a PAH influences whether and how the individual compound is carcinogenic. Some carcinogenic PAHs are <b>genotoxic</b> and induce mutations that initiate cancer; others are not <b>genotoxic</b> and instead affect cancer promotion or progression.|$|E

25|$|A study {{performed}} on mice demonstrated that Passiflora alata has a <b>genotoxic</b> effect on cells, and suggested further research was recommended before this one species is considered safe for human consumption.|$|E
25|$|Red No. 3 is a {{coloring}} agent {{used in some}} foods. In laboratory tests human breast cell DNA was found positive for damage when put into contact with Red No. 3, which means that it is <b>genotoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carcinogens {{are defined}} as any {{substance}} that causes cancer. The toxicodynamics of carcinogens can be complex due to the varying mechanisms of action for different carcinogenic toxicants. Because of their complex nature, carcinogens are classified as either <b>genotoxic</b> or nongenotoxic carcinogens.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that uranium has caused reproductive defects, and other health problems in rodents, frogs and other animals. Uranium was shown to have cytotoxic, <b>genotoxic</b> and carcinogenic effects in animal studies. It has been shown in rodents and frogs that water-soluble forms of uranium are teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are chemical products of combustion from coal burners, fuel, cigarette smoke, {{and various other}} sources. PAH's are often found {{in the air and}} are breathed into the body. PAH's bioaccumulate easily and can copy the estrogen hormone. PAH's can also be <b>genotoxic,</b> meaning they have the ability to harm DNA.|$|E
25|$|DDT is an {{endocrine}} disruptor. It {{is considered}} {{likely to be}} a human carcinogen although the majority of studies suggest it is not directly <b>genotoxic.</b> DDE acts as a weak androgen receptor antagonist, but not as an estrogen. p,p'-DDT, DDT's main component, has little or no androgenic or estrogenic activity. The minor component o,p'-DDT has weak estrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to large}} amounts of lindane can harm the nervous system, {{producing}} a range of symptoms from headache and dizziness to seizures, convulsions, and more rarely, death. Lindane has not been shown to affect the immune system in humans, {{and it is not}} considered to be <b>genotoxic.</b> Prenatal exposure to β-HCH, an isomer of lindane and production byproduct, has been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels and could affect brain development.|$|E
25|$|US EPA {{drinking}} water quality standards limit chloramine concentration for public water systems to 4 {{parts per million}} (ppm) based on a running annual average of all samples in the distribution system. In order to meet EPA-regulated limits on halogenated disinfection by-products, many utilities are switching from chlorination to chloramination. While chloramination produces fewer regulated total halogenated disinfection by-products, it can produce greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated disinfection byproducts and N-nitrosodimethylamine. Both iodinated disinfection by-products and N-nitrosodimethylamine {{have been shown to}} be <b>genotoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Government of Gujarat had {{initiated}} {{a study in}} response to the workers' rally in Bhavnagar and representations made by Sishuvihar, an NGO based in Ahmadabad. The committee constituted for the study also included former Deputy Director of NIOH, Ahmadabad. The committee noted that the WHO, FAO, IARC and US EPA have indicated that endosulfan is not carcinogenic, not teratogenic, not mutagenic and not <b>genotoxic.</b> The highlight of this report is the farmer exposure study based on analysis of their blood reports for residues of endosulfan and the absence of any residues. This corroborates the lack of residues in worker-exposure studies.|$|E
25|$|Nongenotoxic, or {{epigenetic}} carcinogens {{are different}} and slightly more ambiguous than <b>genotoxic</b> carcinogens {{since they are}} not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis {{does not change the}} sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes. Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, {{little is known about the}} mechanistic pathway. It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Patulin is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} a variety of molds, in particular, Aspergillus and Penicillium and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, in general the amount of patulin in apple products is viewed as a measure {{of the quality of the}} apples used in production. In addition, patulin has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. While not considered a particularly potent toxin, a number of studies have shown patulin to be <b>genotoxic,</b> which has led some to theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50µg/L in apple juice.|$|E
25|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an {{integration}} point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is activated by various environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. The activation requires its phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), or its autophosphorylation triggered by the interaction of MAP3K7IP1/TAB1 protein with this kinase. The substrates of this kinase include transcription regulator ATF2, MEF2C, and MAX, cell cycle regulator CDC25B, and tumor suppressor p53, which suggest the roles of this kinase in stress-related transcription and cell cycle regulation, as well as in <b>genotoxic</b> stress response. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide is {{considered}} a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} acrylamide post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a <b>genotoxic</b> metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, <b>genotoxic,</b> and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Genotoxic</b> {{carcinogens}} interact {{directly with}} DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites. Toxicants such as PAHs can be <b>genotoxic</b> carcinogens to aquatic organisms. [...] PAHs are widely {{spread throughout the}} environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products. Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, and Benzofluoranthene, are bioavailable and responsible for liver diseases like cancer in wild fish populations. One mechanism of action for <b>genotoxic</b> carcinogens includes the formation of DNA adducts. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes metabolized and available for biotransformation.|$|E
2500|$|A USEPA review notes PFOA has not [...] "been {{shown to}} be {{mutagenic}} {{in a variety of}} assays". PFOA {{has been described as a}} member of a group of [...] "classic non-genotoxic carcinogens". However, a provisional German assessment notes that a 2005 study found PFOA to be <b>genotoxic</b> via a peroxisome proliferation pathway that produced oxygen radicals in HepG2 cells, and a 2006 study demonstrated the induction and suppression of a broad range of genes; therefore, it states that the indirect <b>genotoxic</b> (and thus carcinogenic) potential of PFOA cannot be dismissed. Criteria have been proposed that would allow PFOA, and other perfluorinated compounds, to be classified as [...] "weakly non-specific genotoxic".|$|E
2500|$|... {{presence}} of replication stress and potential <b>genotoxic</b> conditions. Thus, ATR-Chk1 activity further prevents potential replication {{problems at the}} level of single replication origins by inhibiting initiation of replication throughout the genome, until the signaling cascade maintaining cell-cycle arrest is turned off.|$|E
2500|$|The ASA {{noted that}} Rawlins' quote {{referred}} {{to the use of}} animal testing in [...] "long-term carcinogenicity studies with known <b>genotoxic</b> compounds or compounds that produced hyperplasia in chronic toxicity tests only," [...] and did not imply that he was against all animal testing.|$|E
2500|$|There is no proven risk of {{biological}} harm from even very powerful static magnetic fields. However, <b>genotoxic</b> (i.e., potentially carcinogenic) effects of MRI scanning {{have been demonstrated}} in vivo and in vitro, leading a recent review to recommend [...] "a need for further studies and prudent use {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary examinations, according to the precautionary principle". In a comparison of <b>genotoxic</b> effects of MRI compared with those of CT scans, Knuuti et al. reported that even though the DNA damage detected after MRI was at a level comparable to that produced by scans using ionizing radiation (low-dose coronary CT angiography, nuclear imaging, and X-ray angiography), differences in the mechanism by which this damage takes place suggests that the cancer risk of MRI, if any, is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the adeno-associated virus is a deficiency in replication and thus its inability to multiply in unaffected cells. [...] The first factor that was described as providing successful generation of new AAV particles, was the adenovirus, from which the AAV name originated. It was then shown that AAV replication can be facilitated by selected proteins derived from the adenovirus genome, by other viruses such as HSV, or by <b>genotoxic</b> agents, such as UV irradiation or hydroxyurea.|$|E
2500|$|EDTA {{exhibits}} low {{acute toxicity}} with [...] (rat) of 2.0 g/kg to 2.2 g/kg. It {{has been found}} to be both cytotoxic and weakly <b>genotoxic</b> in laboratory animals. [...] Oral exposures have been noted to cause reproductive and developmental effects. The same study by Lanigan also found that both dermal exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to EDTA in aerosolized cosmetic formulations would produce exposure levels below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies.|$|E
2500|$|Tobacco {{smoke is}} a complex mixture of over 5,000 {{identified}} chemicals, of which 98 {{are known to have}} specific toxicological properties. The most important chemicals causing cancer are those that produce DNA damage since such damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. [...] Cunningham et al. combined the microgram weight of the compound in the smoke of one cigarette with the known <b>genotoxic</b> effect per microgram to identify the most carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke. [...] The seven most important carcinogens in tobacco smoke are shown in the table, along with DNA alterations they cause.|$|E
2500|$|DNA damage occurs very {{frequently}} and is generated {{from exposure to}} a variety of both exogenous and endogenous <b>genotoxic</b> sources. [...] One of these include ionizing radiation, such as γ radiation and X-rays, which ionize the deoxyribose groups in the DNA backbone and can induce DSBs. [...] Reactive oxygen species, ROS, such as superoxide (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (HO•), and singlet oxygen (1O2), can also produce DSBs as a result of ionizing radiation as well as cellular metabolic processes that are naturally occurring. [...] DSBs can also be caused by the action of DNA polymerase while attempting to replicate DNA over a nick that was introduced as a result of DNA damage.|$|E
2500|$|The minimal {{set of the}} {{adenoviral}} genes {{required for}} efficient generation of progeny AAV particles, was discovered by Matsushita, Ellinger et al. This discovery allowed for new production methods of recombinant AAV, which do not require adenoviral co-infection of the AAV-producing cells. [...] In the absence of helper virus or <b>genotoxic</b> factors, AAV DNA can either integrate into the host genome or persist in episomal form. In the former case integration is mediated by Rep78 and Rep68 proteins and requires the presence of ITRs flanking the region being integrated. In mice, the AAV genome has been observed persisting {{for long periods of}} time in quiescent tissues, such as skeletal muscles, in episomal form (a circular head-to-tail conformation).|$|E
2500|$|The postmeiotic {{phase of}} mouse {{spermatogenesis}} is {{very sensitive to}} environmental <b>genotoxic</b> agents, because as male germ cells form mature spermatozoa they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage. [...] Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing spermatozoa, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases spermatozoa-derived chromosomal aberrations. [...] Treatment of male mice with melphalan, a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an unrepaired state as germ cells progress though DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development. [...] Such unrepaired DNA damages in spermatozoa, after fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.|$|E
2500|$|Toxicants {{have been}} grouped {{together}} {{according to their}} chemical properties by way of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), which allows prediction of toxic action based on these properties. [...] endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and carcinogens are examples of classes of toxicants that can act as QSARs. EDCs mimic or block transcriptional activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones. [...] These types of chemicals can act on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thyroid hormone receptors. [...] This mechanism can include such toxicants as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Another class of chemicals, carcinogens, are substances that cause cancer and can be classified as <b>genotoxic</b> or nongenotoxic carcinogens. [...] These categories include toxicants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).|$|E
2500|$|It is {{impossible}} to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers. [...] In a few cases, only one cause exists; for example, the virus HHV-8 causes all Kaposi's sarcomas. [...] However, {{with the help of}} cancer epidemiology techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations. [...] For example, lung cancer has several causes, including tobacco use and radon gas. [...] Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco, so the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause. [...] These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. Among the more than 5,000 compounds in tobacco smoke, the <b>genotoxic</b> DNA damaging agents that occur both at the highest concentrations and which have the strongest mutagenic effects are acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.|$|E
2500|$|Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, {{ingredients}} of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant (EPPP) or pesticides {{may not be}} eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to water pollution. Although concentrations of those substances and their decompostion products are quite low, {{there is still a}} chance to harm aquatic organisms. For pharmaceuticals, the following substances have been identified as [...] "toxicologically relevant": substances with endocrine disrupting effects, <b>genotoxic</b> substances and substances that enhance the development of bacterial resistances. They mainly belong to the group of environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of activated carbon filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method. Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation. A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants {{and at the same time}} to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells. Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.|$|E
2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be <b>genotoxic</b> (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|E
