5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the incident. Maddy tries {{to find out what}} is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
25|$|When police {{knocked on}} Einem's door and enquired {{about whether they}} could ask him a few questions, his {{immediate}} reaction was {{to say that he}} wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide.|$|E
25|$|Politically, however, Giolitti did {{not survive}} the scandal. He had been Finance Minister in the {{government}} that had suppressed the original 1889 report. As Prime Minister he had borrowed from the Banca Romana for governmental purposes in August 1892, had nominated the bank's governor, Tanlongo, to the Senate, and had resisted a parliamentary enquiry, encouraging suspicions that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide. Tanlongo and the Banca Romana's tried to defame Giolitti, calculating that a change of government {{would result in the}} release of the defendants.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you!" [...] {{the doctor}} burst out. [...] "He begged me--his enemy, as he thinks--to bring you {{to him at}} once. It seems <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to you alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blackbeard sends {{a message}} to the great old chief," [...] said the interpreter. [...] "He wishes him to pay the Kablunets a visit. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> show to the great old chief." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{families}} living in Duxbury (sometimes [...] "Duxborough") {{asked to be}} set off from Plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister; this request was granted in 1637. [...] Historian Justin Winsor and others have insisted that the name of Duxbury was given by Standish in honor of Duxbury Hall, near Chorley in Lancashire, which was owned by {{a branch of the}} Standish family. [...] The coincidence would suggest that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it, though no records exist to indicate how the town was named.|$|E
500|$|He {{was sentenced}} to life on June 27, 1930, on the old murder charge. He {{remained}} silent during the trial. Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed." [...] The [...] "iron prefect", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascioferro and the text of the court sentence.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend {{of one of the}} Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when I decided that I had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E

500|$|The Season Two DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim doing impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam, Dwight noting that he is so determined to find the culprit that {{he is prepared to}} pray [...] "to Thor himself", Toby saying that he does not think Michael is taking drugs, Jim secretly doing an impression of Dwight right in front of him, Dwight talking about Jim and concluding that, [...] "If that were my life, I'd do drugs", Pam toying with Dwight by admitting that she [...] "was a teensy bit high... in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy", Meredith coming to Jim because Pam told her <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell her. Jim is under the jinx and says nothing, Kelly putting a customer on hold when she is called by Dwight and forgetting to return, Dwight taking notes during the conference, Pam showing the camera the flyer that Michael made up for the conference, and Lee and Gino, the workers at Vance Refrigeration, discarding a joint in the parking lot.|$|E
500|$|Contrecœur {{prepared}} {{an official}} {{report of the}} action {{that was based on}} two sources. [...] Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville's slaying: [...] " [...] saw themselves surrounded by the English {{on one side and the}} Indians on the Other. [...] The English gave them two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. [...] Mr. de Jumonville, by his interpreter, told them to desist, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell them. [...] Upon which they ceased firing. [...] Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire, to be read ... Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us". [...] Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that [...] "Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.|$|E
2500|$|Police did not {{say whether}} the search of the {{basement}} had turned up anything significant. But almost a year later, in May 2014, Bronx County prosecutors presented the evidence against Bonie [...] to a grand jury, which indicted him on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. An [...] arrest warrant was issued for Bonie. The New York Post reported that an acquaintance had told police that Bonie had admitted to him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Moore's disappearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{as bad as}} she can be, dears. She {{has been}} delirious all night, and is so this morning. I {{did not like to}} leave her for a moment. But this kind old man wanted me to go with him, as I think <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is only in}} a good humor, I take it, when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> get. However, I must be off now, or the {{legitimate}} period of Uncle Carroll's absence will be over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] replied Acton, [...] "I'll take a {{bill for}} the money. We'll go along and record the sale as soon as Mr. Nasmyth's ready. I expect <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Edward F. Fry {{writes in}} Cubism (1978): [...] "Three female nudes are in various postures, {{and the blue}} bird is held by the {{uppermost}} figure; {{in other parts of}} the composition are numerous birds, grapes in a dish on a table, the striped canopy of a Paris cafe, the dome of Sacre-Coeur in Montmartre, and a ship at sea." [...] (Bold added). Noticeably, the 'striped canopy' to which Fry refers has the same color pattern as the American flag. Recall that L'Oiseau bleu was painted as the International Exhibition of Modern Art (the Armory Show) in New York was beginning to materialize; when Arthur B. Davies and Walt Kuhn came to Paris in the fall of 1912 to select works for the Armory Show, with the help of Walter Pach. The paintings of Metzinger, however, did not appear at the exhibition (to the surprise of many in his entourage); and this despite Picasso's 1912 recommendation. In a note to Kuhn, Picasso's handwritten list of artists recommended for the Armory Show include Gris, Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Duchamp, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Laurencin, La Fresnaye and Braque. He did however exhibit at the Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures, Boggs & Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913. His Portrait of an American Smoking (Man with a Pipe), 1911–12 (Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin) was reproduced on the front cover of the catalogue. It is highly likely, since Walter Pach knew practically all the artists in the exhibition (a good friend of Metzinger and other members of the Section d'Or group; e.g., Gleizes, Picabia and the Duchamp brothers), that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the organization of the show. Sponsored by the Gimbel Brothers department store from May through the summer of 1913 the Cubist and Futurist show toured Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds {{to tell a story}} about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that calls to mind Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say. [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
