In every Age people have reached {{salvation}} through {{different types of}} action and sadhana (spiritual discipline), but in this Age one can reach liberation only through hard work. I want real, practical human beings and only he is a true human being who lives in accordance with this Age. We need not consider religion or caste, but look only to hard work." ...|$|E
2500|$|My father, after I had {{finished}} saying what I have repeated above, {{looked at me}} a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: [...] "My son, I can swear before high heaven that what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{about the origin of}} [...] is true.

Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} have worked quite so enthusiastically for me," [...] queried the false one archly, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> everything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "if you had {{committed}} a murder, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{call that}} cool," [...] he repeated; [...] "you seem to count very {{securely}} upon Uncle Ned. But look here, Gid, <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to keep away?" ...|$|R
2500|$|This theory {{contradicts the}} {{testimony}} of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation {{with any of the}} sects of Mormonism: [...] "My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about the origin of [...] is true.

6000|$|... 'I assure you, my good lady,' {{said the}} mild schoolmaster, 'that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the plain truth. As I {{hope to be}} saved, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the truth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But am I not? See how {{reasonably}} I {{have spoken}} to you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the exact truth. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> why I do not take quite that same pleasure in your company as when you first came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was foolish}} {{of me to}} {{withhold}} it--foolish and inconsequent. Yet I believe that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> should not <b>have</b> been here now. So, after all, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no regrets.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is talking}} like a jealous wife {{instead of a}} {{reasonable}} girl, Annina. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> that <b>I</b> am on business of the last importance, and that delay may bring heavy calamities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eccellenza, you bid {{me speak}} of the time, in the second place; after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of the where, in the first place. I wish to do {{whatever}} will give you pleasure, S'nore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once {{about your}} detestable habit of {{shouting}} in the house, Clarence, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> a hundred times. If you cannot be a Boy Scout quietly, you must stop being one altogether. I had {{got up to}} six that time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mrs. O'Hara, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that to me}} she is as {{high and}} good and noble {{as though she were}} a Princess.

60|$|Her. Ay, Zara, {{and it may}} be kept; {{but these}} sad tears will change to sighs of joy when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> all. Then thou wilt bless the vow which brings thee sorrow now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought, sir," [...] {{answered}} Nigel, {{with as much}} haughtiness as {{was consistent}} with the cool distance which he desired to preserve, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> my name at present was Nigel Grahame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The running away, as {{you call}} it, aunt, {{did not take place}} till two days after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all about it. I thought he would have done as much as that for his brother's daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|HARNESS. [Coldly.] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{what we will}} do with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean to {{tell you}} nothing but what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> is, {{that it is a}} moral impossibility that any son or {{daughter}} of Adam can stand on this ground that I put my foot on, or on any ground that mortal treads, and gainsay the healthy tenure on which we hold our existence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will each}} keep our secret," [...] said Mary. [...] "Only {{remember}} this: should Frank marry to-morrow, I shall have no ground for blaming him. He is free as far I as am concerned. He {{can take the}} London lady if he likes. You may tell him so from me.

6000|$|... "But don't you {{see that}} if you didn't let me know he was here it would look to him as if I didn't wish to meet him--as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that you were not}} to {{introduce}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot said: [...] "I prithee, fair youth, {{tell me what}} is thy name since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> ours, for <b>I</b> {{find that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> great love for thee so that I would fain know who thou art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bewitched! bewitched!--Cursed be {{the hour}} I acted on the thought, that Love hath no reserves. Never should <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> {{the story of}} that face, Lucy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> bared myself too much to thee. Oh, never should Love know all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} you," [...] Rice continued, [...] "of Drexley and of poor young Silverton. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that there have}} been many others. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that she even tried to do you ill that you might be {{numbered}} amongst her victims. Now I tell you what as yet I have told no man. I, too, was once the most pitiful of her slaves." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that if I {{leave this}} room, I shall not take them with me.|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. Yes. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{the whole}} truth. Go {{and find out}} if it helps you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee,</b> Stephen, thy poor friend. Angels are {{not like}} me. Between them, and a working woman fu' of faults, there is a deep gulf set. My little sister is among them, but she is changed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I {{ought to be}} ashamed of myself for coming after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> couldn't," [...] she said. [...] "It will serve me right if you've eaten all the dinner, but I do hope you haven't." ...|$|R

60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how Sir Percival {{performed}} {{his first}} adventures {{in the world}} of chivalry after he had perfected himself in the mysteries of knighthood under the teaching of Sir Launcelot of the Lake, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how he achieved that adventure with great credit to himself and with great glory to the order of knighthood to which he now truly belonged as a most worthy member.|$|E
60|$|Chr. His lordship {{then will}} find the prologue of his trouble, doubting <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of his ruffling.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. Robert, {{this must}} stop. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that there is}} no one in that roomâ€”that is enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very good}} idea, Chetwode," [...] he said. [...] "I will {{certainly}} inform Mr. Jarvis. Poor Rosario!" [...] {{he went on}} thoughtfully.

6000|$|... "Well, I didnâ€™t want {{to spoil}} a bargain," [...] said the seaman carelessly. [...] "Maybe, you wouldnâ€™t have bought the stone if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> Mind that thing donâ€™t go off; I donâ€™t want to rob you. Point {{it the other}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped now," [...] said Lord Marchmont; [...] "but <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> before, Selina.
