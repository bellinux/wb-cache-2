5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, {{and that it was}} made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E

At the time of release, Southend <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> release downloadable content, though they implemented a method to do so. The game was Southend's first full release.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Queensland was a weak cricketing state, {{having only}} been {{admitted}} to the Sheffield Shield in 192627, and the national selectors tended to choose Australia teams composed entirely of New South Welshmen, Victorians and South Australians. New South Wales' Bert Oldfield was the incumbent wicket-keeper and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> retire, while Victoria's Ben Barnett had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England. South Australia's Charlie Walker was also talked of as a possible Test player.|$|E

Growing up, Greenwald <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> be a wrestler, but she was {{interested}} in appearing on American Gladiators. She trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18, and at age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75pounds) for her age group by lifting 100pounds. She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not because she wanted to be on TV.|$|E
5|$|Following {{creative}} tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, {{followed by}} Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined {{them as a}} session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London {{as part of the}} global awareness event Live 8; Gilmour and Waters later stated they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|In April 2003, a Japanese {{television}} advertisement {{revealed that}} both Mother 3 and a combined Mother 1+2 cartridge were in {{development for the}} handheld Game Boy Advance. Mother 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release {{on the basis that}} it would not sell. Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi stated that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as Mother 1, Mother 1+2 and Mother 3 were not released outside Japan. Despite this, Ness's recurrence in the Super Smash Bros. series signaled favorable odds {{for the future of the}} Mother series.|$|E

5|$|In December 2008, Resident Evil was ported to the GameCube's successor, the Wii, {{along with}} Resident Evil Zero. The port, titled Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil, {{features}} a control system that supports both the Wii Remote and the GameCube controller. Although Capcom originally <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> release the Wii version outside Japan, {{arguing that the}} game would not sell very well, the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due to the commercial success of Resident Evil 5. The Wii version received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some publications criticized it for its outdated controls, lack of new features, and lack of widescreen support.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat died of natural causes (without explaining which) and the agency <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the costs would be reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> sell NSB.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|HIStory was {{promoted}} with the successful HIStory World Tour, beginning on September 7, 1996, and ending on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, and grossed {{a total of}} , becoming Jackson's most successful tour in terms of audience figures. During the tour, Jackson married his longtime friend Deborah Jeanne Rowe, a dermatology nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Rowe was approximately six months pregnant with the couple's first child at the time. Originally, Rowe and Jackson <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> marry, but Jackson's mother Katherine persuaded them to do so. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998. The couple divorced in 1999, and Jackson received full custody of the children. The divorce was relatively amicable, but a subsequent custody suit was not settled until 2006.|$|E

5|$|Illinois was {{released}} on July 4, 2005, through Rough Trade Records in Europe and was distributed domestically by Asthmatic Kitty Records starting July 5, 2005. Although he initially <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> perform this material live, {{less than two weeks}} after the release of Illinois, Stevens embarked on a North American tour to promote the album, performing with a string section of eight to ten members named the Illinoisemakers. He deliberately chose to avoid television as a promotional tool and focused on the tour performances themselves. He was supported on some dates by opening acts Liz Janes (who is also signed to Asthmatic Kitty) and Laura Veirs as well as Illinois collaborator Shara Nova's solo project My Brightest Diamond. He toured in support of the album again from September through November 2006, this time including dates in several European cities. During the 2006 dates, Stevens and his band transitioned from wearing University of Illinois-themed outfits to butterfly suits and bird wings.|$|E
5|$|The port was {{released}} on September 17, 2009. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 2, 2012. Speaking in January 2010, Namco Bandai announced that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> release the port overseas. Later that year, Yuri's English voice actor Troy Baker {{said that he had}} been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port. A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due to a deal with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories. Later, she retracted this statement, apologizing for creating false impressions. Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the original, meaning a Japan-exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden. This also coincided with poor marketing feedback for the series in western territories.|$|E
5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would never make it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} began mid-July, 1919. At {{the time}} Poland signed a ceasefire in the Polish–Ukrainian War; Lithuania was invaded by the Bermontians {{from the north}} and the Saxon Volunteers were leaving the Lithuanian Army. Piłsudski was planning to use a network of the Polish Military Organization (PMO), an underground organization he created during World War I for diversionary and intelligence operations-like purposes. On July 31, Piłsudski and Polish diplomat Leon Wasilewski arrived at Vilnius, then controlled by Poland. Piłsudski's visit had no clear explanation. He later said that he arrived to negotiate with Lithuanians, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, while Lithuanian historian Vytautas Lesčius suggests he was holding talks with pro-Polish estate owners from the Vilnius Region. On August 3, Wasilewski arrived at Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, to negotiate with Prime Minister Mykolas Sleževičius. The Polish mission declared that Poland <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future. The Lithuanians replied that the disputed territories were an integral part of Lithuania and rejected the idea of a plebiscite. Negotiations broke down and Wasilewski left Kaunas on August 7. The negotiations were then used to evaluate viability of the coup, the preparedness of the PMO, and the attitude of Lithuanian diplomats towards a union with Poland.|$|E
