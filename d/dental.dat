5|$|In 1799 Joseph Fox {{started to}} give a series of lectures on <b>dental</b> surgery at Guy’s Hospital, and was {{appointed}} <b>dental</b> surgeon in the same year. Thomas Bell succeeded Fox as <b>dental</b> surgeon either in 1817 or 1825. Frederick Newland Pedley, who was appointed assistant <b>dental</b> surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in 1885, advocated {{the establishment of a}} <b>dental</b> school within the hospital, and he flooded the two <b>dental</b> schools in London, the Metropolitan School of <b>Dental</b> Science and the London School of <b>Dental</b> Surgery, with patients to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy’s Hospital <b>Dental</b> School was established. Guy’s Hospital <b>Dental</b> School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for <b>dental</b> services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested {{that there should be a}} decrease in the number of <b>dental</b> undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses. In response to the recommendations, Royal <b>Dental</b> Hospital of London School of <b>Dental</b> Surgery amalgamated with the Guy’s Hospital <b>Dental</b> School of the United Medical and <b>Dental</b> Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1983.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Dental</b> Institute is the <b>dental</b> {{school of}} King's {{and focuses on}} {{understanding}} disease, enhancing health and restoring function. The institute is the successor of Guy's Hospital <b>Dental</b> School, King's College Hospital <b>Dental</b> School, Royal <b>Dental</b> Hospital of London School of <b>Dental</b> Surgery, and the United Medical and <b>Dental</b> Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. It {{was a part of}} King's School of Medicine and Dentistry until 2005, when the <b>dental</b> school became the <b>Dental</b> Institute.|$|E
5|$|The School of <b>Dental</b> Medicine is a {{professional}} school at the university. The school graduates one degree, Doctor of <b>Dental</b> Medicine. It will also have two residencies in Advanced Education in General Dentistry and <b>Dental</b> General Practice. The school also will offer a specialty program in Pedodontics. It was founded on February 24, 2006 at the East Carolina Board of Trustees meeting. The <b>dental</b> school was unanimously approved by the UNC System Board of Governors as well. The facilities are located on the Health Sciences Campus and will house {{the first three years}} of education. <b>Dental</b> students will complete their final year at ECU Community Service Learning Centers to be located throughout the state. The School of <b>Dental</b> Medicine is one of two <b>dental</b> schools in the state.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the first and the second Slavic palatalizations, velars {{alternate}} with <b>dentals</b> and palatals. In addition, as {{a result of}} a process usually termed iotation (or iodization), velars and <b>dentals</b> alternate with palatals in various inflected forms and in word formation.|$|R

5|$|<b>Dental</b> anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though <b>dental</b> occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. <b>Dental</b> anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} <b>dental</b> caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of <b>dental</b> caries. Fluoride helps prevent <b>dental</b> decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at Painless Dentistry, the Simpson {{children}} {{are getting their}} teeth checked. It is discovered Lisa needs braces. When Marge informs Homer, he tells her {{not to worry about}} the cost, as the union had won a <b>dental</b> plan during a previous strike. Later, {{at a meeting of the}} local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to give up their <b>dental</b> plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their <b>dental</b> plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their <b>dental</b> plan has helped them all.|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing <b>dental</b> caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other <b>dental</b> disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and <b>dental</b> hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of King's College Hospital <b>Dental</b> School was proposed by Viscount Hambleden at a Hospital Management Committee meeting on 12 April 1923. The <b>dental</b> school was opened on 12 November 1923 in King’s College Hospital. Under the 1948 National Health Act, King's Medical and <b>Dental</b> School split from King's {{and became an}} independent school, but the school remerged with King's in 1983. The school further merged with the United Medical and <b>Dental</b> Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>dental</b> {{implants}} {{is to support}} <b>dental</b> prosthetics. Modern <b>dental</b> implants make use of osseointegration, the biologic process where bone fuses tightly {{to the surface of}} specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a <b>dental</b> emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency <b>dental</b> appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of <b>dental</b> caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of <b>dental</b> surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E

5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by <b>dental</b> (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} toothache is <b>dental</b> in origin.|$|E
5|$|Toothache, {{also known}} as <b>dental</b> pain, is pain in the teeth and/or their {{supporting}} structures, caused by <b>dental</b> diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases.|$|E

25|$|In {{matters of}} sound, English {{alveolar}} consonants map as retroflexes rather than <b>dentals.</b> Two new characters {{were created in}} Gujarati to represent English /æ/'s and /ɔ/'s. Levels of Gujarati-ization in sound vary. Some words don't go far beyond this basic transpositional rule, and sound much like their English source, while others differ in ways, one of those ways being the carrying of <b>dentals.</b> See Indian English.|$|R
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with <b>dental</b> treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of <b>dental</b> decay with a <b>dental</b> drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid <b>dental</b> development, {{particularly among the}} largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower <b>dental</b> development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to <b>dental</b> treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek <b>dental</b> treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing <b>dental</b> treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
