50|$|A furnace can be {{lit by a}} small {{pilot flame}} or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames {{nowadays}} are lit by an <b>ignition</b> <b>transformer</b> (much like a car's spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both diesel and natural gas. When using liquid fuels, an atomizer is used, otherwise, the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (like a match).|$|E

50|$|Capacitor {{discharge}} ignition was developed. It {{produces a}} rising voltage that {{is sent to}} the spark plug. CD system voltages can reach 60,000 volts. CD <b>ignitions</b> use step-up <b>transformers.</b> The step-up transformer uses energy stored in a capacitance to generate electric spark. With either system, a mechanical or electrical control system provides a carefully timed high-voltage to the proper cylinder. This spark, via the spark plug, ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine's cylinders.|$|R
40|$|High {{repetition}} pulse/ {{high frequency}} generators are {{of great interest}} for scientific and technological applications, including high voltage devices. This paper addresses the design and development of a high repetition pulse generator using a PIC microcontroller (PIC 16 F 877 A). The PIC microcontroller generates two PWM pulses to drive the IGBTs through the optocouplers, which can perform fast switching in high voltage devices with low switching losses. The voltage and current supplied by the optocouplers make it perfectly suitable for the driving operations of IGBTs. Experiments were carried out to test its efficiency, and the waveforms of high repetition pulse frequency were observed by oscilloscope. The results of its operation present that the system {{could be used in}} the frequency range 2 kHz < f < 200 kHz. The system was also simulated by a Matlab Simulink model, in which two types of transformer were introduced to predict its validity in real operation with high voltage devices. The simulated results of the designed pulse generator show that the <b>ignition</b> coil <b>transformer</b> is more suitable than other iron core transformers for a high voltage with high pulse frequency. The system could be easily integrated with other high voltage devices to produce high pulsed frequency high voltages...|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of pos. ignition and repeatability by an arc igniter in burners, the configuration of a fuel jet in a counter flow of air is the best. There is a closed domain in front of the jet in which the ignition is effected by an arc when the conditions are well within the blow-off limits. Short, intense arcs are preferable to longer, weaker arcs energized by a given <b>ignition</b> <b>transformer</b> at high air velocities. Increasing the fuel-jet velocity or decreasing the air velocity extends the domain of pos. ignition. The study with small jet diams. that are typical of burners indicates that the domain size is uneffected if the Reynolds no. is held const. with different arc sizes...|$|E
5000|$|With {{this type}} of winding {{structure}} only poor fill factors can be achieved. The random wire placement leads to a wider distribution of resulting wire length on the coil body and consequently {{a wider range of}} electric coil resistances. Wild windings can be created in a homogenous way by using a wire feeding rate of 1.5 to 3 times of the wire diameter. Another purpose of this setting is that prevent a sliding of the winding into lower winding areas, which due to the larger voltage differences can lead to electric shortage. Despite many disadvantages this winding it {{can be seen as the}} most common and economic in mass production. It is characterized by low demands for machinery and operator and can be wound with very high speeds. They are mostly applied in Contactor- and Relaycoils, small <b>transformers,</b> <b>Ignition</b> coils and so forth, or generally devices with relatively small wire gauges up to 0.05 mm. Achieved fill factors with the use of round wires are about 73% to 80% and are lower compared to orthocyclic windings with 90,7%The winding height can be estimated using the formula: ...|$|R
