After being {{brought back to the}} farmhouse, Bryce is told to accept that he is mediocre and ordinary. Elsewhere, Black and Watts {{interview}} Roe again, who seems to espouse the same mindset. Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{different aspects of}} perfectionism in athletes (N = 388) related to the different <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> proposed by Conroy et al. (2002), and how perfectionism and <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> predicted positive and negative affect after imagined success and failure in sports competitions. Results showed that perfectionistic personal standards showed a negative relationship with <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> experiencing shame and embarrassment and a positive relationship with positive affect after success, whereas perfectionistic concern over mistakes and perceived parental pressure showed a positive relationship with <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> experiencing shame and embarrassment and with negative affect after <b>failure.</b> Moreover, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> experiencing shame and embarrassment fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concern and negative affect and between coach pressure and negative affect. The findings demonstrate that <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> experiencing shame and embarrassment is central in the perfectionism-fear <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> relationship and that perfectionistic concern about mistakes and perceived coach pressure are aspects of perfectionism that predict <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> experiencing shame and embarrassment and negative affect after failure...|$|R
50|$|Pervasive refusal {{syndrome}} {{is for the}} most part frequently seen in girls and less so in boys. The average age of onset is between the ages of 7 and 15.

The onset of PRS is usually acute.|$|R
25|$|Trump {{supports}} Kiyosaki's view on {{the learning}} opportunity created by failure, writing, students who {{rise to the top}} of the class academically are not always those who succeed at entrepreneurship. He writes this is due to a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> and ascribes business success to the experience of learning from failures. Trump compares this to the business sector, writing that those who have learned from failures in business simultaneously learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. He differentiates between practical intelligence and academic intelligence.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that gifted students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E
25|$|Boring's self-criticism, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> {{and need}} for peer-acceptance became unmanageable and {{affected}} the productivity of his work. In 1933, {{at the suggestion of}} his friends and family, Boring began psychoanalysis treatment with a former colleague of Freud, Hanns Sachs. Boring remained in psychoanalysis for a year, five sessions a week, but he found it to be ineffective in alleviating his concerns. Boring had hoped to achieve a change in personality {{by the end of the}} experience and was disappointed to find that he still had his old mindset. Four years later, both Sachs and Boring wrote about the experience in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. The two men agreed that the psychoanalysis was not successful.|$|E

25|$|Motivational {{theories}} {{also explain}} how learners' goals {{affect the way}} they engage with academic tasks. Those who have mastery goals strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence {{in the face of}} failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.|$|E
25|$|Long poem authors {{sometimes}} find {{great difficulty}} {{in making the}} entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound {{is an example of}} this dilemma, with his poem The Cantos. As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.|$|E

Rowling described Hermione as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character with [...] "a lot of insecurity and a great <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> beneath her swottiness". Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll, and her magical and analytical skills {{play an important role in}} finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.|$|E

500|$|In the book, Rowling {{introduces}} {{an eclectic}} cast of characters. The first character {{to be introduced}} is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard", and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, [...] "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character with [...] "a lot of insecurity and a great <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> beneath her swottiness".|$|E
500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E
500|$|Newton, using old {{technology}} from Walter and Bell's research, {{is able to}} pull an entire building from the parallel universe to the prime, and the team races against time to prevent harm when, due {{to the laws of}} mass conservation, a building from the prime is pulled to the parallel one. This event forces Walter to try to coax Olivia to recall her Cortexiphan abilities as to identify things affected by the parallel universe. Initially unable to do so, her <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> enables her ability, allowing them to save the people within the target building, but also revealing to her that Peter is from the parallel universe. Walter explains to Olivia that in 1985, he and Bell had devised a way to observe the parallel universe, where he found his doppelgänger, [...] "Walternate", was also close to losing his son. Though Walter's Peter had died, Walternate continued to search for a cure, but missed the telltale sign when the Observer September arrived at his lab. Walter resynthesized the cure and aimed to cross over using untested equipment at Reiden Lake, though stalled by Nina and his lab assistant Clara. Nina tackled him on his way over, losing her arm in the process, while Walter, on the other side, found the cure vial broken. Intent on curing the alternate Peter, he posed as his father and crossed back with Peter, intending to administer the cure at the lab and then return Peter. However, on the return, the ice on Reiden Lake broke, threatening to drown both, but they were saved by September, who cautioned Walter [...] "the boy must live". While Walter successfully administered the cure, his wife Elizabeth saw Peter, and Walter realized he could never return Peter to the parallel universe. After Walter reveals this truth, he considers letting Peter know but struggles with how to do so, hoping to seek repentance from God for his actions.|$|E
50|$|Although {{disorder}} for written expressions {{skills can}} be difficult and an enduring problem all throughout childhood into adulthood, different types of treatment and support can help individuals who have this disorder to employ strategies and skills {{in the home and}} school environment. This includes remedial education tailored to improve specific skills, providing special academic services in the learning environment, and addressing concurrent health and mental issues. It is sometimes necessary to foster motivational techniques to maintain motivation and minimize negative thoughts or feelings. Using whatever modifications are necessary to overcome <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> {{in the early stages of}} writing mediation is strongly encouraged because children with learning disabilities often experience low self-esteem and confidence, which may further interfere with learning and academic success.|$|R

Doug Funnie and his family (which consists of his parents Theda and Phil, sister Judy, and dog Porkchop) move from the town of Bloatsburg to Bluffington after his dad receives a job promotion. Bluffington is located in the US, but not in any specific US state. However Bluffington is loosely based on the city of Richmond, Virginia, where creator Jim Jinkins was born and raised. Beyond the title character, Doug featured a large ensemble cast of characters. Many of the series' ancillary characters, among them Ms. Wingo and Mr. Spitz, are based on authority figures from Jinkins' childhood.|$|R
50|$|They fear wrong {{answers and}} {{shy away from}} {{challenges}} because {{they may not have}} the right answer. That, in the school setting, does their thinking and learning a great disservice. A teacher's job is to help them overcome their <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and explore the problem for real learning s often, teachers are doing the opposite, building children’s fears up to monumental proportions. Children need to see that failure is honorable and that it helps them construct meaning. It should not be seen as humiliating but as a step to real learning. Being afraid of mistakes, they never try to understand their own mistakes and cannot and will not try to understand when their thinking is faulty. Adding to children's’s fear in school is corporal punishment and humiliation, both of which can scare children into right/wrong thinking and away from their natural exploratory thinking.|$|R
2500|$|Johnson's {{success in}} the Senate {{rendered}} him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; {{he had been the}} [...] "favorite son" [...] candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956, and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. Jim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it better to wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy. Johnson's late entry into the campaign in July 1960, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing [...] "Landslide Lyndon". Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
