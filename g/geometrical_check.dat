40|$|The use of {{discrete}} data to represent engineering structures as derivatives from intersecting components requires algorithms to perform Boolean operations between groups of quadrilateral and triangular surfaces. In the intersection process, an accurate and efficient method for {{the determination of}} intersection lines is a crucial step for large scale and complex surface intersections. An algorithm based on tracing the neighbours of intersecting quadrilaterals is proposed to determine the intersection lines. A background grid is employed to limit the scope of searching for candidate quadrilaterals that may intersect. This will drastically cut down the time of <b>geometrical</b> <b>check</b> for intersections between quadrilaterals, making the surface intersection and mesh generation a quasi-linear process {{with respect to the}} number of elements involved. Given the node numbers at the vertices of the candidate quadrilaterals, the neighbour relationship is then established. In the determination of intersection, each quadrilateral is divided into two triangles and four fundamental cases are identified and treated systematically to enhance robustness and reliability. Tracing the neighbours for the determination of intersection lines not only greatly increases the efficiency of the process, it also improves the reliability as branching and degenerated cases can all be dealt with in a consistent manner on the intersecting surfaces concerned. Examples on a great variety of surface and mesh characteristics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

The C-NEM was proposed by the authors in a former work [Yvonnet J, Ryckelynck D, Lorong P, Chinesta F. A new extension of the natural element method for non-convex and discontinuous domains: the constrained natural element method (C-NEM). Int J Numer Methods Eng 2004; 60 : 1451 – 1474] and its main meshless features, that allow to describe large domain changes as well as to handle fixed or moving discontinuities, were analyzed in [Yvonnet J, Chinesta F, Lorong P, Rynckelynck D. The constrained natural element method (C-NEM) for treating thermal models involving moving interfaces. Int J Thermal Sci 2005; 44 : 559 – 569; Yvonnet J, Lorong P, Ryckelynck D, Chinesta F. Simulating dynamic thermo-elastoplasticity in large transformations with adaptive refinement in the natural element method: application to shear banding. Int J Forming Process 2005; 8 : 347 – 363]. Sometimes, in order to improve the interpolation accuracy for describing boundary layers or an anisotropic behavior, new nodes must be added, removed or repositioned. The interpolation in the vast majority of meshless techniques is free of mesh quality requirement. Thus, introduction, elimination or repositioning of nodes is a trivial task, because no geometrical restrictions exist. In this way, nodes can be added without <b>geometrical</b> <b>checks</b> in the regions where the solution must be improved (identified by using an appropriate error indicator). For this purpose, in this paper an a posteriori error indicator will be proposed and tested in some linear elastostatic problems benchmarks involving different levels of difficulty (stress concentration, solution singularities, …) all of them with a known exact solution. The computational implementation of this error indicator is very simple, and when it is used in tandem with an efficient refinement procedure, which makes use of the meshless features of the C-NEM, provides an accurate adaptation procedure, specially appropriate in the C-NEM framework...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} more and more difficult to ensure robust patterning after OPC due to the continuous reduction of layout dimensions and diminishing process windows associated with each successive lithographic generation. Lithographers must guarantee high imaging fidelity throughout the entire range of normal process variations. The techniques of Mask Rule Checking (MRC) and Optical Rule Checking (ORC) have become mandatory tools for ensuring that OPC delivers robust patterning. However the first method relies on <b>geometrical</b> <b>checks</b> and the second one is based on a model built at best process conditions. Thus those techniques do not have the ability to address all potential printing errors throughout the process window (PW). To address this issue, a technique known as Critical Failure ORC (CFORC) was introduced that uses optical parameters from aerial image simulations. In CFORC, a numerical model is used to correlate these optical parameters with experimental data taken throughout the process window to predict printing errors. This method has proven its efficiency for detecting potential printing issues through the entire process window [1]. However this analytical method is based on optical parameters extracted via an optical model built at single process conditions. It is reasonable to expect that a verification method involving optical models built from several points throughout PW would provide more accurate predictions of printing errors for complex features. To verify this approach, compact optical models similar to those used for standard OPC were built and calibrated with experimental data measured at the PW limits. This model is then applied to various test patterns to predict potential printing errors. In this paper, a comparison between these two approaches is presented for the poly layer at 65 nm node patterning. Examples of specific failure predictions obtained separately with the two techniques are compared with experimental results. The details of implementing these two techniques on full product layouts are also included in this study...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate {{formation}} {{is an important}} process in industrial and environ mental turbulent flows. Two examples in the environmental area, where turbulent aggregate formation takes place, are raindrop formation in clouds and Marine Snow (aggregate) formation in the upper layer in the oceans. The dispersion of inertial particles {{differs from that of}} (passive) fluid particles and is dominated by particle-turbulence interaction. This is especially important when the particle scales match the small-scale turbulent flow scales. Our motivation to study turbulent aggregate formation comes from the need to describe aggregate formation in small-scale turbulence in the oceans. For a proper description, the study of aggregate formation in turbulent flows requires a particle-based model, i. e. following single particles. Therefore, three main processes should be modeled: the turbulent flow, the motion of the particles, and the collision between particles and subsequent aggregate formation. In this study we use 3 D kinematic simulations to model the turbulent flow. A simplified version of the Maxey-Riley equation is used to describe the motion of the particles. For the collision and aggregate formation a <b>geometrical</b> collision <b>check</b> is used: when the distance between two particles is smaller than the sum of their radii a collision takes place. All the particles that collide stay together to form an aggregate, i. e. 100 % coagulation efficiency. To account for the porosity of the aggregates a Fractal Growth Model is used. In this study the importance of the Stokes number and the fractal dimension of the aggregates on collision rates and aggregate formation has been explored, finding that the preferential concentration plays a very important role in aggregate formation by creating regions of high particle concentration. Other results are: the net effect of fractal growth is to increase the aggregate Stokes number and to decrease the density of the aggregate.

40|$|Topological mesh {{adaptivity}} can {{be required}} in problems involving large displacements or de-formations of objects. For instance, in fluid-structure simulations {{in which the}} structure is highly deformable, the common node relocation techniques (elastic analogy, Laplace equa-tion, [...] .) cannot always provide an acceptable mesh. Efforts {{have been made in}} previous works to implement efficient mesh adaptation algorithms that overcome these issues [3, 1, 2]. When dealing with complex geometries, a particular attention has to be paid to the adaptive operations performed at the geometrical boundaries. In this work, we present a simple and efficient technique to fullfill a geometrical model when adapting the mesh. We start from an adaptive method described in [2] which first relocates the volume nodes of the domain according to an imposed displacement of the boundaries of the domain. The mesh is then adapted with the common mesh modification operators like edge splits, edge collapses and edge swaps in order to meet a length criterion for the edges and to preserve a minimal quality of the elements. In this work, an additional step is inserted in the adaptation procedure which relocates new boundary nodes on the appropriate <b>geometrical</b> boundary and <b>check</b> the validity of the new mesh. Based on the curvature of the geometrical boundaries, edge swaps are then performed in order to improve the conformity of the mesh to the geometrical model. The procedure is also integrated into the open source package MAdLib [3]. Numerical examples are presented which demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique. References [1] C.

In order to optimize equipment utilization and assembly {{time for a new}} product, this thesis presents algorithms and tools to <b>check</b> <b>geometrical</b> feasibility and minimize cycle time in multirobot stations. Robustness for the assembly process is very important, therefore geometrical variation is also considered during path and assembly planning.

The main idea is to let the robot move in the workspace areas where there is less uncertainty. Another tool presented integrates assembly design, sequence optimization and path planning, which can be used in order to evaluate different concepts regarding locating scheme and the robustness in its critical dimensions. The major contribution is a new approach to schedule robot operations to avoid collisions and minimize cycle time for multirobot stations. Two articles present algorithms and tools to distribute the operations workload among several robots and coordinate them.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the problem of <b>Geometrical</b> Design Rule <b>Checking</b> (DRC). Previous DRC implementations have dealt with fully instantiated geometrical artwork. As the complexity of VLSI increases, it becomes infeasible to analyze the vast amounts of information present in a fully instantiated design. The DRC algorithm presented here introduces an approach that exploits the structural hierarchy of a design {{in order to reduce the}} computational complexity of the geometrical tests that need to be made. The technique described is also app 1 icable to other types of design checking such as circuit extraction, functional verification and electrical rule verification. A new DRC algorithm has been developed that, by making use of the structure inherent in a hierarchical design, eliminates many redundant design rule checks. In this approach there are two places where possible design rule violations may occur. The first is within a symbol definition. The second is the area where two symbols interact. The algorithm checks a given definition only once, and then examines how interactions within each new environment where the definition is placed modify the original definition. A note is made after each interaction has been scrutinized, so that a duplicate situation will not be rechecked. An implementation of the hierarchical DRC algorithm has been written at Caltech. This implementation extracts a minimal number of pairwise geometrical comparisons needed to check the entire design. The program accepts as input a design description in the Caltech Intermediate Form (CIF). The output of the program is currently a fully instantiated version of those portions of the gcwrnctry that need to be checked in order to check the entire design. A means of expressing the designer's intent through the design description is required. Current DRCs deal with geometrical artwork exclusively. Most of the difficult design rules are involved in the checking of devices. Rather than restricting the designer to the use of geometry, the idea of a primitive element is introduced. A primitive element is defined to be anything that cannut he broken down into sub-elements. A design defined using primitive elements conveys more of the functional structure than a purely geometric definition...|$|R
