40|$|This study {{investigated}} experimentally and theoretically, how condensate and initial {{formation of a}} thin frost layer {{on the surface of}} the evaporator affects the evaporator performance of room air-conditioners compared to <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> conditions. The theoretically obtained results were validated with the measured values in both wet and initial frost formation conditions and a good correlation was found. The results indicated that, at the same range of change in face velocity value, the total conductivity of a <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> (UA) <b>dry</b> is increased by 38. 8 %. However, when it is combined with an increase in latent heat to the evaporator total cooling capacity ratio value (Qlat/Q) of 10. 6 %, the total conductivity of wet coil (UA) wet is 45. 4 %. These results clearly indicate that the evaporator coil is characterized by higher performance under wet conditions compared to <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> conditions. The results also show that the total conductivity after initial formation of a thin frost layer (UA) Fr has a higher value by about 8. 2 % than the <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> condition.

40|$|The {{combined}} use of dry cooling air-handler {{and dedicated}} ventilation (DV) system for energy saving and better indoor condition {{has been confirmed}} effective. But the application of this system is hindered by the condensation risk on <b>dry</b> cooling <b>coil.</b> In this study, the condensation risk {{of the use of}} dry cooling air-handler and dedicated ventilation (DCDV) system in subtropical climates was examined by analysing its application in a typical office building in Hong Kong using actual equipment performance data and realistic system characteristics. Through hour-by-hour simulations {{it was found that the}} annualised cumulative frequency of occurrence of condensation (ConHR) for normal operation of the office building was acceptable. However, departures of the in-use condition from design values are inevitable. Additional parametric studies were therefore performed to evaluate the influence of five design parameters on the ConHR, and to identify the influential factors. By statistical analysis, it was found that ConHR was most sensitive to changes in system latent load, followed by (descending order) system sensible heat ratio, system total load and design moisture absorption coefficient of <b>dry</b> cooling <b>coil.</b> Furthermore, a regression model relating ConHR to latent load, sensible heat ratio, total load and design moisture absorption coefficient was established for minimising condensation risk during the design of DCDV system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{improper}} charging on the performance (capacity, EER, power consumption, SEER, and coefficient of degradation) of a residential air conditioner during the steady state (wet and <b>dry</b> <b>coils)</b> and cycling operation was investigated. The fully charged condition was established as a base case. A full charge was obtained charging the unit to the superheat specified by the manufacturer's charging chart for specific set of indoor and outdoor temperatures. Once the full charge was determined, the unit was subjected to 20 %, 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % under and overcharging of refrigerant (by mass). The fully charged tests were compared to under and overcharging. The performance of the unit was evaluated {{as a function of}} charge as well as at four outdoor room temperatures (82 ?F, 90 ?F, 95 ?F, and 100 ?F). As the outdoor temperature increased, the total capacity and EER dropped. The investigation of improper charging showed that the total capacity, EER, and SEER were more sensitive to undercharging than overcharging conditions. A 20 % undercharge resulted in a 21 % reduction in SEER while a 20 % overcharge produced a 11 % reduction in SEER.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the role of a fin-and-tube heat exchanger in modifying microbial indoor air quality. Specifically, depositional losses of ambient bioaerosols and particles onto dry (not cooled) and wet (cool) coil surfaces were measured for different airspeeds passing through the test coil. Total, bacterial and fungal DNA concentrations in condensate water produced by a wet coil were also quantified by means of fluorescent dsDNA-binding dye and qPCR assays. Results revealed that the deposition of bioaerosols and total particles is substantial on coil surfaces, especially when wet and cool. The average deposition fraction was 0. 14 for total DNA, 0. 18 for bacterial DNA and 0. 22 for fungal DNA on the <b>dry</b> <b>coil,</b> increasing to 0. 51 for total DNA, 0. 50 for bacterial DNA and 0. 68 for fungal DNA on the wet coil. Overall, as expected, deposition fractions increased with increasing particle size and increasing airspeed. Deposited DNA was removed from the cooling coil surfaces through the flow of condensing water at a rate comparable to the rate of direct deposition from air. A downward trend of bacterial and fungal DNA measured in condensate water over time provides suggestive evidence of biological growth on heat exchangers during nonoperational times of a ventilation system. This investigation provides new information about bioaerosol deposition onto a conventional fin-and-tube cooling coil, a potentially important factor influencing indoor exposure to microbial aerosols in air-conditioned buildings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the modeling of round tube plate fin heat exchanger (RTPF) and microchannel heat exchanger (MCHX) under wet air conditions. Â The heat exchanger models {{are based on}} finite volume method. In each control volume, the empirical heat transfer and pressure drop correlations for refrigerant and air are adopted and the effectiveness-NTU method is applied for heat transfer calculation. For the round tube heat exchanger, the tube circuiting is considered. For microchannel heat exchanger, both uniform distribution and maldistribution among parallel microchannel tubes are investigated and compared. When the air dew point temperature {{is higher than the}} tube wall temperature, dehumidification occurs. Two methods are compared to simulate the wet air condition: (1) the air side is simulated based on the total enthalpy method; (2) the air side is simulated based on simultaneous heat and mass transfer method. The heat exchanger models are validated against the experimental results of a 2. 5 ton residential air-conditioning system in Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Center at University of Illinois.

40|$|Effects of {{compressor}} on/off {{cycle times}} shorter than typical a/c heat exchanger {{thermal time constant}} (~ 1 min) were examined {{as a method of}} cooling capacity regulation. Short compressor on/off cycle times enable the use of heat exchangers continuously throughout entire off-cycle, thus reducing on-cycle temperature lift and increasing COP compared to conventional cycling. Experiments were done for a typical residential a/c system for run time fractions from 0. 3 to 1. 0, and cycle periods from 10 to 80 seconds. The objective was to understand how pulsed refrigerant flow from the compressor affects performance of the other components. Refrigerant side heat transfer resistance, pressure drop, and magnitude and curvature of heat exchanger surface temperature fluctuations were identified as the most influential factors affecting system performance. Virtually identical effects were observed for wet and <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> experiments. Results at a run time fraction of 0. 56 were compared to continuous (simulating variable speed) operation of a smaller compressor providing the same cooling capacity. Cycling the compressor at cycle periods of 10 - 80 sec degraded the performance of other components enough to reduce COP by approximately 2. 5 - 7. 5 %, respectively. The corresponding COP loss for conventional long-cycling was 11. 5 %, all on the condenser side, because evaporator surface temperature was held constant to ensure that sensible and latent capacities were comparable. Comparisons of actual variable speed and cycling strategies must also account for parasitic power such as inverter losses and differences in fan and blower power...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the the transient behavior of an automobile arr conditioning system was performed. The experiments were conducted on an original equipment air conditioning system modified for laboratory investigation. Qualitative results showing a clear relationship between refrigerant charge and mean clutch cycling period, and between refrigerant charge and the transient behavior of the evaporator outlet refrigerant temperature, were obtained. A five-factor, two-level, designed experiment was performed to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} clutch cycling period of the air conditioning refrigeration system to small (8 %- 15 %) changes in: condenser air flow rate, condenser air inlet temperature, evaporator air inlet temperature, compressor speed, and refrigerant mass. The values chosen for each factor were based on a nominal operating condition which assumed a vehicle speed of 60 mph, and an air conditioning system operating on maximum cold setting, full recirculation, and maximum evaporator speed. The test facility permitted the control of condenser and evaporator air flow rates and inlet air temperatures, compressor speed, and refrigerant charge. Evaporator fan speed was set at the same value for all tests, and all tests were run <b>dry</b> <b>coil.</b> For the range of variables studied, experimental results showed that refrigerant charge loss corresponded to a shortening of the mean clutch cycling period and a decrease in the variance of the mean clutch cycling period. Experimental results further showed that the transient behavior of the evaporator refrigerant outlet temperature, following each clutch engagement, was clearly a function of refrigerant charge. A parameter, Time to Temperature Turning, was defined which adequately describes this behavior in terms of time and temperature only. The results imply that a strong possiblity exists {{for the development of a}} real-time, on-line refrigerant charge loss diagnostic device based on temperature measurements and time.

In each control volume, the empirical heat transfer and pressure drop correlations for refrigerant and air are adopted and the effectiveness-NTU method is applied for heat transfer calculation. If the humidity ratio of air is high and dehumidification occurs, the air side is simulated based on the total enthalpy method. For round-tube heat exchanger, the tube circuiting is considered. For microchannel heat exchanger, it is assumed uniform distribution among parallel microchannel tube. The compressor model is based on the manufacturerâ€™s 10 -coefficient map method. The expansion valve is simulated as an isenthalpic process. The inputs into the system model are air inlet conditions and refrigerant superheat and subcooling. The system model is validated against the experimental results of a 2. 5 ton residential air-conditioning system in Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Center at University of Illinois.

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the applicability of adiabatic humidification in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of semiconductor cleanrooms. Accurate temperature and humidity control are essential in semiconductor cleanrooms and high energy consumption steam humidification is commonly used. Therefore, we propose an adiabatic humidification system employing a pressurized water atomizer to reduce the energy consumption.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Air {{handling}} unit systems are {{the series of}} mechanical systems that regulate and circulate the air through the ducts inside the buildings. In a commercial setting, air {{handling unit}}s {{accounted for more than}} 50 % of the total energy cost of the building in 2013. To make the system more energy efficient and reduce amount of CO₂ gases and energy waste, it is very important for building energy management systems to have an accurate model to help predict and optimize the energy usage and eliminate the energy waste. In this work, two models are described to focus on the energy usage for heating/cooling coils as well as fans for the air handling unit. Enthalpy based effectiveness and <b>Dry</b> Wet <b>coil</b> methods were identified and compared for the system performance. Two different types of control systems were modeled for this research, and the results are shown based on occupancy reflected by the collected CO₂ data. Discrete On/O and fuzzy logic controller techniques were simulated using Simulink MATLAB software and compared based on energy reduction and system performance. Air handling unit located in the basement of one campus building is used for the test case of this study. The data for model inputs is collected wirelessly from the building using fully function device (FFD) and pan coordinator to send/receive the data wirelessly. The air handling unit modeling also is done using Engineering Equation Solver EES Software for the coils and AHU subsystems. Current building management system Metasys software was used to get additional data as model inputs. Moving Average technique was utilized to make the model results more readable and less noisy. Simulation results show that in humid regions where there is more than 45 % of relative humidity, the <b>dry</b> wet <b>coil</b> method is the effective way to provide more accurate details of the heat transfer and energy usage of the air handling unit comparing to the other method enthalpy-based effectiveness. Also, fuzzy logic controller results show that 62 % of the current return fan energy can be reduced weekly using this method without sacrificing the occupant comfort level comparing to the ON/OFF method.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford A. Klein and Douglas T. Reindl; 156 pp. We take for granted the abundance and variety of food that is available to us all year round. Grocery stores around the U. S and the world sell {{a wide variety of}} fruits and vegetables throughout the year no matter when the harvesting season took place; this in large part due to cold storage warehouses. Cold storage warehouses place otherwise perishable food items into freezers and coolers where they can be stored for months, or even years, until they are ready for sale. Many food items placed in storage require the temperature to be held at low temperatures. Though the low temperatures are needed to maintain the quality of stored products, it has an adverse effect on the refrigeration system. By operating warehouses at temperatures below the freezing point, water (in the form of frost) will accumulate on the air- cooling evaporators used to cool the space. As frost builds up on an evaporator, the resistance to heat transfer between air and the refrigerant increases, airflow through the evaporator decreases, and the overall efficiency of the evaporator decreases. The goal of this research project is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} factors that influence defrost performance as well as the parasitic impacts on system energy consumption by generating a transient computer model of the processes involved in a hot gas defrost cycle on an evaporator coil of known geometry. This study focuses on utilizing different refrigerant temperatures for melting frost accumulated on the evaporator's coils. To evaluate an evaporator undergoing a defrost process; models of a <b>dry</b> <b>coil</b> as well as a frosted coil were developed using EES (Engineering Equation Solver). The models approximated the coil by representing it as a tube with a radial fin. The models themselves are made up of multiple nodes which are defined by energy boundaries. The nodes in the models are transient and are temperature driven. Freezer conditions as well as frost properties are also implemented in the programs to simulate different environments. The frosted fin model was used to record the time to melt a given mass of frost as well as find the distribution of energy associated with defrosting. The dry fin model was created to record the excess amount of energy that goes into a defrost process that lasts longer than the time required to melt the accumulated frost. The last part of the study focuses on the estimating costs associated with the parasitic loads created by initiating a defrost cycle. Since the energy that is lost from convection, evaporation, and stored energy in the metal coils of the evaporator has to be reclaimed, the compressors in the refrigeration system are analyzed to estimate the energy costs associated with operating a compressor to circulate the refrigerant in order to capture the energy from the surroundings. The compressor cost evaluation is based on a single stage and a two stage system using different operating head pressures to simulate the effects of defrosting throughout a typical year.

In this paper we describe {{a condition in which}} the bloom  is of multi-year duration consisting of different morphologies of a single cyanobacteria species. Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, México maintained a year-round massive (10 8 trichomes L - 1) population of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria, Cylindrospermopsis spp. The trichomes are present as straight and coiled morphotypes.   The relative trichome morphology abundance varied with rainy (June – October) and dry seasons (November – May), but total trichome abundance did not vary.  Coiled trichomes and heterocytes (occurring only on coiled trichomes) were significantly more abundant, both absolutely and relatively, during the <b>dry</b> season. Both <b>coiled</b> trichome and heterocyte mean volumes were significantly smaller during the rainy season than during the dry season.   Biovolumes were largest in January when water temperature was 5 º C cooler suggesting buoyancy as a morphology-determining factor. However, with a more than three-fold lower TIN concentration during the dry season, we hypothesized that the coiled morphotype became abundant primarily because it formed heterocytes, which the straight morphotype did not. Spatial trichome and heterocyte abundance differences were small among the 15 lake sites (average CV for all dates = 20 %). However, there was a pattern of increased heterocyte and coiled trichome abundance from lake inflow, as a nitrogen source, to outflow during the rainy season. The total volume of heterocytes per litre of lake water increased progressively four-fold from a minimum early in the rainy season to a maximum {{at the end of the}} dry season.
