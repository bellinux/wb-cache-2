5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows all too well about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now gamekeeper for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E

In recent years membership has increased steadily, with supporters now registered throughout the world.

25|$|<b>Fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the common}} {{perception}} was that water was an infinite resource.

They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of peak water. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.|$|E

500|$|Khewra Salt Mine {{is a major}} tourist attraction, with around 250,000 {{visitors}} a year, earning it considerable revenue. Visitors are taken into the mine on a train.

In 2003 two phases of development of tourist facilities and attractions were carried out, at a total cost of 9 million rupees.

500|$|In The New Yorker, Penelope Gilliatt {{said it was}} [...] "some kind {{of great}} film, and an unforgettable endeavor...

[...] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was [...] "the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the {{industry}} might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film." [...] Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that 2001 was [...] "a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. It's also a dazzling 160-minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth." [...] Philip French wrote that the film was [...] "perhaps the first multi-million-dollar supercolossal movie since D.W. Griffith's Intolerance <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> which can be regarded as the work of one man...Space Odyssey is important as the high-water mark of science-fiction movie making, or at least of the genre's futuristic branch." [...] The Boston Globe's review indicated that it was [...] "the world's most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before or, for that matter, anywhere... The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review, believing the film [...] "succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale." [...] He later put it on his Top 10 list for Sight & Sound. Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews of the film in various issues in 1968, each one slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review dated December 27, 1968, the magazine called 2001 [...] "an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick.
