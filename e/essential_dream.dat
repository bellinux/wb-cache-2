60|$|There is one rather {{interesting}} {{example of}} this state of things in which the weaker literature is really the stronger and the stronger the weaker. It {{is the case of}} what may be called, for the sake of an approximate description, the literature of aristocracy; or, if you prefer the description, the literature of snobbishness. Now if any one wishes to find a really effective and comprehensible and permanent case for aristocracy well and sincerely stated, let him read, not the modern philosophical conservatives, not even Nietzsche, let him read the Bow Bells Novelettes. Of the case of Nietzsche I am confessedly more doubtful. Nietzsche and the Bow Bells Novelettes have both obviously the same fundamental character; they both worship the tall man with curling moustaches and herculean bodily power, and they both worship him in a manner which is somewhat feminine and hysterical. Even here, however, the Novelette easily maintains its philosophical superiority, because it does attribute to the strong man those virtues which do commonly belong to him, such virtues as laziness and kindliness and a rather reckless benevolence, and a great dislike of hurting the weak. Nietzsche, on the other hand, attributes to the strong man that scorn against weakness which only exists among invalids. It is not, however, of the secondary merits of the great German philosopher, but of the primary merits of the Bow Bells Novelettes, that it is my present affair to speak. The picture of aristocracy in the popular sentimental novelette seems to me very satisfactory as a permanent political and philosophical guide. It may be inaccurate about details such as the title by which a baronet is addressed or the width of a mountain chasm which a baronet can conveniently leap, {{but it is not a}} bad description of the general idea and intention of aristocracy as they exist in human affairs. The <b>essential</b> <b>dream</b> of aristocracy is magnificence and valour; and if the Family Herald Supplement sometimes distorts or exaggerates these things, at least, it does not fall short in them. It never errs by making the mountain chasm too narrow or the title of the baronet insufficiently impressive. But above this sane reliable old literature of snobbishness there has arisen in our time another kind of literature of snobbishness which, with its much higher pretensions, seems to me worthy of very much less respect. Incidentally (if that matters), it is much better literature. But it is immeasurably worse philosophy, immeasurably worse ethics and politics, immeasurably worse vital rendering of aristocracy and humanity as they really are. From such books as those of which I wish now to speak we can discover what a clever man can do with the idea of aristocracy. But from the Family Herald Supplement literature we can learn what the idea of aristocracy can do with a man who is not clever. And when we know that we know English history.|$|E

(2000: p. 16) whilst {{explaining}} Zhitro {{discuss the}} primary importance of lucid dreaming {{to the practice}} of Dream Yoga and pinpoint its four stages:In order to make the time we spend dreaming more meaningful, we must first recognize that we are dreaming. That is the initial exercise. The next step is called transforming the dream; the third is known as multiplying. The fourth practice is to unify the dream with the clear light. Recognizing, transforming, multiplying and unifying the dream with the luminosity of the true nature; these four outline the <b>essential</b> applications of <b>dream</b> yoga.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSleep {{disorders}} {{are the focus}} of numerous physiological, psychological and psychiatric studies, most of which are based on cognitive, behavioral and developmental models. The psychoanalytic model is not often used in contemporary research, {{in spite of the fact}} that dreams are central in psychoanalysis. This article aims to heighten awareness to the relevance of psychoanalytic perspectives in the research on sleep disorders. Indeed, the complexity of sleep disorders calls for a confrontation between different health disciplines and specialties. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period and complaints of sleep disturbance frequent. Even though physical, hormonal and behavioral changes have an undeniable impact on sleep, we underscore the importance of exploring the intrapsychic conflicts characteristic of this period. The resurgence of sexual and aggressive impulses must to be worked through in order to fully understand the underpinnings of disturbed sleep. Based on research we are conducting at present, we first focus on the regression that takes place during sleep, with its corollary, passivity. We find that adolescents prone to sleep disturbances resist the passive position that comes with regression. We then show how this resistance to passivity is linked to a difficulty in expressing internalized aggressiveness and how the excessive retention and repression of these affects can transform them into destructiveness and self-destructive behavior. Sleep has a constructive and organizing function that is <b>essential</b> to <b>dreaming,</b> and dreaming is a container for the symbolization of sexual and aggressive fantasies. Sleep disorders hinder this symbolization and thus, the processing of intrapsychic conflicts. Working through these conflicts is however necessary, as otherwise they re-emerge and disturb sleep. This vicious cycle amplifies the self-destructive impact of sleep disorders. Lastly, we underscore the fear of death that is linked to sleep disorders and the unconscious associations between death and sleep...|$|R

2500|$|Chumbley {{considered}} {{the practice of}} willed <b>dreaming</b> <b>essential</b> {{as a means of}} interacting directly and consciously with the spiritual dimensions he called 'the High Sabbat'; according to him [...] "Every word, deed and thought can empower, magnetise, and establish points of receptivity for a magical dream, likewise any of these means can do the oppositefixating perception {{in a manner that is}} not receptivethat seals the soul in the body instead of enabling it to go forth at will." [...] In conjunction with dreaming and trance experience Chumbley used automatic writing and drawing to manifest the knowledge drawn from ritual magic; these procedures, in which the magician offers her or himself as a vehicle for the forces summoned instead of utilising another as medium, is uncommon in the Western occult tradition - one modern exemplar being Austin Osman Spare. The results of Chumbley's practices can be seen in his drawings and sigillisations. Chumbley believed that the natural manifestation of magical gnosis and power occurs through creative activity: [...] "Dreaming and the mutual translation of dreamt ritual and ritual-as-dreamt form the basic rationale and context for our work. The active discourse between initiates and our spirit-patrons inspires and motivates this dreaming. This is demonstrably manifest in the magical artistry of individual initiates, whether through text, ritual performance, song, tapestry, craftsmanship, or image." ...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, neuropsychology {{has focused}} on {{identifying}} the brain mechanisms of specific psychological processes, such as attention, motor skills, perception, memory, language, and consciousness, {{as well as their}} corresponding disorders. However, there are psychological processes that have received little attention in this field, such as dreaming. This study examined the clinical and experimental neuropsychological research relevant to dreaming, ranging from sleep disorders in patients with brain damage, to brain functioning during REM sleep, using different methods of brain imaging. These findings were analyzed within the framework of Luria’s Three Functional Unit Model of the Brain, and a proposal was made to explain certain of the <b>essential</b> characteristics of <b>dreaming.</b> This explanation describes how, during dreaming, an activation of the First Functional Unit occurs, comprising the reticular formation of the brainstem; this activates, in turn, the Second Functional Unit — which is formed by the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes and Unit L, which is comprised of the limbic system, as well as simultaneous hypo-functioning of the Third Functional Unit (frontal lobe). This activity produces a perception of hallucinatory images of various sensory modes, as well as a lack of inhibition, a non-selfreflexive thought process, and a lack of planning and direction of such oneiric images. Dreaming is considered a type of natural confabulation, similar to the one that occurs in patients with frontal lobe damage or schizophrenia. The study also suggests that the confabulatory, bizarre, and impulsive nature of dreaming has a function in the cognitiveemotional homeostasis that aids proper brain function throughout the day...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} whether a dream can be a work of art. In the first step, we deal with Norman Malcolm's claim that the sentence 'I dream while I am asleep' is a senseless one to utter. In order to wake up, one has to have some degree of awareness. This awareness, it is argued, can also direct itself {{to the process of}} dreaming, so that we can have a meaningful language game about dreaming. In the second step, Morris Weitz's anti-essentialist approach towards defining art is evaluated. Weitz claims that art cannot be defined because it is an open concept. In line with Wittgenstein, it is argued that many of the most rigid concepts in mathematics and logic are open concepts, and that open concepts have rules all the same. Turning to relational rather than intrinsic aspects of artworks to find such rules, we end up with Jerrold Levinson's historical definition of art. Something becomes a work of art when the owner of the object intends it to be regarded in the complex ways that previous works of art were correctly regarded. After a discussion about the similarity between dreams and movies {{at the start of the}} third step, we argue that dreams can be regarded aesthetically and that an aesthetic or a psychoanalytic interpretation of <b>dreams</b> are not <b>essential</b> characterizations of <b>dreams.</b> Finally, we make the case that a dream can become a work of art when it is regarded in the complex way that previous works of art were regarded; whereby we focus especially on art requiring skill and public discussions about art...|$|R
