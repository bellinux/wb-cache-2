40|$|Abstract. Potentially {{adverse health}} effects due to the {{exposure}} of living bodies to electromagnetic radiation is still a subject of debate. An engineering perspective on this issue deals with electromagnetic field parameters estimate by computation and measurement and with the certification of the electric and electronic equipment in compliance with <b>exposure</b> <b>standards.</b> The paper presented here describes a 3 D computational model, based on the finite element method, {{for the study of}} microwaves penetration in the head exposed in the near field of a dipole antenna, in conditions similar to mobile telephony. The head is accurate in its external shape and has an equivalent homogeneous inner structure. The microwaves penetration in human tissue is superficial and the electric field distribution is less sensible to the accuracy of the inner anatomy, than to the body shape. Field parameters, like electric field strength and specific energy absorption rate, are evaluated in order to be compared to values stated in limiting <b>exposure</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
50|$|The respirable {{fraction}} of lunar dusts may be toxic to humans. NASA has therefore determined that an <b>exposure</b> <b>standard</b> {{is necessary to}} {{limit the amount of}} respirable airborne lunar dusts to which astronauts will be exposed. The nominal toxicity that is expected from ordinary mineral dust may be increased for lunar dusts due to the large and chemically reactive surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposures to mineral dusts during industrial operations and from volcanic eruptions give researchers some sense of the relative toxicity of lunar dust, although the Earth-based analogs have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth-based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are chemically reactive and can elicit an increased toxic response. Since lunar dust is formed in space vacuum from highly energetic processes, the grain surfaces can be expected to be indefinitely reactive on the lunar surface. NASA predicts that this chemical reactivity will change once the dust is brought into a habitable environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} base {{shows that}} prolonged exposure to respirable lunar dust could {{be detrimental to}} human health. Lunar dust {{is known to have}} a large surface area (i.e., it is porous), and a substantial portion is in the respirable range. The surface of the lunar dust particles is known to be chemically activated by processes ongoing at the surface of the moon. Predictions are that this reactivity will disappear on entry into the habitable volume; however, it is not known how quickly the passivation of chemical reactivity will occur, nor is it known how toxic the deactivated dust may prove to be. Although many Apollo astronauts seemed to tolerate lunar dust, their exposure times were brief and time (duration) exposure factors need to be determined. Other Apollo crew members and ground support personnel noted that the lunar dust was a sensory irritant. Finally, the size characteristics of the dust that actually was present in the atmosphere of the lunar lander have never been determined. Obtaining data will help NASA understand the size distribution of the particles that are expected to be found in future lunar habitats. It is important to design experiments that will close or, at a minimum, narrow knowledge gaps so that a scientifically defensible <b>exposure</b> <b>standard</b> can be set by NASA for protection of crew health.|$|E

The standard allows for infiltration credits and intermittent ventilation patterns that can be shown to provide comparable performance. Whole-house ventilation methods have a substantial effect on time-varying indoor pollutant concentrations. If alternatives specified by Standard 62. 2, such as intermittent ventilation, are used, short-term pollutant concentrations could exceed acute health standards even if chronic health standards are met. The authors present a methodology for comparing ASHRAE- and non-ASHRAE-specified ventilation scenarios on relative indoor pollutant concentrations. We use numerical modeling to compare the maximum time-averaged concentrations for acute exposure relevant (1 -hour, 8 -hour, 24 -hour) and chronic exposure relevant (1 -year) time periods for four different ventilation scenarios in six climates with a range of normalized leakage values. The results suggest that long-term concentrations are the most important metric for assessing the effectiveness of whole-house ventilation systems in meeting <b>exposure</b> <b>standards</b> and that, if chronic health <b>exposure</b> <b>standards</b> are met, acute standards will also be met...|$|R
