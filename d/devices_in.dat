5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile <b>devices.</b> <b>In</b> 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E

Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector. While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile <b>devices.</b> <b>In</b> July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E
30|$|In Figure  8, {{we compare}} the energy {{consumption}} per superframe for device and relay of SM, RM, and ETM {{in three different}} spatial configurations, characterized by α and β. The consumed energy of the <b>device</b> <b>in</b> RM and ETM is the same and constant (green-red solid line in Figure  8). This value is significantly smaller (reduction by 33 % to 48 %) than the energy consumption of the <b>device</b> <b>in</b> SM. Also the consumed energy in the relay for RM node is smaller than the energy consumption of the <b>device</b> <b>in</b> SM, when it cooperates with only one <b>device.</b> <b>In</b> that case, powering by a battery is possible. If the relay forwards data from many devices, the power consumption would increase and mains powering should be considered. The relay for ETM consumes a constant amount of energy, independent from the link quality and at PER values higher than 9 %, this consumption is smaller {{than that of the}} <b>device</b> <b>in</b> SM. As mentioned already for the relay for RM, the number of supported devices affects the energy consumption.|$|R

5|$|Angry Birds is {{a casual}} puzzle video game {{developed}} by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by {{a sketch of}} stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> December 2009. Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store, which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably those using the Android, Symbian, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and for PCs. A sequel, titled Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians to their own <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> {{the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique to the platform. It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, who created the initial concept at the request of Tetsuya Nomura for a game that had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with measuring <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 {{parts per}} million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point-to-point rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to promote the show's second season, Schmidt {{released}} a study book entitled The American Bible Challenge: A Daily Reader, Volume 1 in 2013. The book features nine weeks worth of study and questions previously seen on the show. Each day introduces a different lesson and passage of Scripture, with five questions being asked {{at the end of}} the day's lesson. An online Bible study was also launched on GSN's website at the start of the second season. In addition to the Bible studies, GSN released a mobile game based on the show for Facebook, iOS devices, and Android <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> 2012, while Talicor released a board game based on the series in 2014.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using mechanical components which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such <b>devices</b> <b>in</b> mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, capacitors and resistors respectively.|$|E
