UV tapes are dicing tapes in which the adhesive bond is broken by exposure to UV light after dicing, allowing the adhesive to be stronger during cutting while still allowing clean and easy removal. [...] UV equipment can range from low power (a few mW/cm2) to high power (more than 200mW/cm2).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a concept for the wafer-scale manufacturing of microactuators {{based on the}} adhesive bonding of bulk shape-memory-alloy (SMA) sheets to silicon microstructures. Wafer-scale integration of a cold-state deformation mechanism {{is provided by the}} deposition of stressed films onto the SMA sheet. A concept for heating of the SMA by Joule heating through a resistive heater layer is presented. Critical fabrication issues were investigated, including the cold-state deformation, the bonding scheme and related stresses, and the titanium-nickel (TiNi) sheet patterning. Novel methods for the transfer stamping of adhesive and for the handling of the thin TiNi sheets were developed, based on the use of standard <b>dicing</b> blue <b>tape.</b> First demonstrator TiNi cantilevers, wafer-level adhesively bonded on a microstructured silicon substrate, were successfully fabricated and evaluated. Intrinsically stressed silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to deform the cantilevers in the cold state. Tip deflections for 2. 5 -mm-long cantilevers in cold/hot state of 250 / 70 and 125 / 28 mu m were obtained using silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, respectively. The bond strength proved to be stronger than the force created by the 2. 5 -mm-long TiNi cantilever and showed no degradation after more than 700 temperature cycles. The shape-memory behavior of the TiNi is maintained during the integration process. QC 20100727 </p...|$|R

30|$|The MoS 2 layer {{crystals}} {{used for}} this study were grown using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using bromine (Br) as the transport agent [17]. The source material powders including molybdenum and sulfur together with the bromine were sealed in a quartz ampoule at a vacuum degree of 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 5  Torr. Prior to the CVT growth process, the ampoules were annealed at 1050  °C in an oven for 1  month to compound the source materials. The temperatures of the source and crystallization ends were, respectively, controlled at 1050 and 960  °C during the CVT growth. The MoS 2 nanoflakes were obtained by exfoliating bulk crystals using <b>dicing</b> <b>tape</b> and were then dispersed on the insulating SiO 2 (300  nm)/n-Si templates with pre-patterned Ti/Au circuits. Two platinum (Pt) metal contacts were subsequently deposited on the selected MoS 2 flakes using focused-ion beam (FIB) technique. The voltage and current of the ion beam for the Pt precursor decomposition were operated at 30  kV and 100  pA, respectively. In addition, silver paste was used for the metal electrode of the millimeter-sized MoS 2 bulks. The crystal quality of MoS 2 was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The thicknesses of the MoS 2 flakes were defined by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrical characterization was performed at an ultralow current leakage probe station (LakeShore Cryotronics TTP 4). The dc voltage and current were, respectively, sourced and measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200 -SCS). A Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532  nm was used as an excitation light source for the photoconductivity measurement. An optical diffuser was used to broaden laser beam size (~ 20  mm 2) to uniformly illuminate the conduction channel of the nanoflake and bulk samples for the steady-state photocurrent measurements. The incident laser power was measured by a calibrated power meter (Ophir Nova II) with a silicon photodiode head (Ophir PD 300 -UV).|$|E
40|$|Motivation During {{research}} and development regarding next generation solar cells, many experiments are performed on multi-crystalline silicon (Si) wafers. One regular task is the separation of different areas of interest on a Si wafer. Separating multi-crystalline Si wafers implies one major challenge: Breaking the samples manually leads most often to a heap of Si crumbs which are only useful with limitations afterwards. This paper investigates the applicability of a novel wafer separation method, the thermal laser separation (TLS), on the separation of multi-crystalline Si wafers. TLS has already proven its applicability in the dicing of mono-crystalline Si wafers [1]. For the dicing of multi-crystalline Si, TLS will be compared to manual scribe and break and the mechanical wafer saw. E ach method is applied to wire saw cut multi-crystalline Si wafers. The methods are briefly described, experimental results are compared {{with each other and}} the separation methods are evaluated. Approach Samples of wire saw cut Si wafers (156 mm x 156 mm) are used to evaluate three separation methods. Each sample should be separated into squares of 20 mm edge length. For the sample preparation an accuracy of ap-prox. 100 μm in straightness is sufficient. The following separation methods are evaluated: Scribe and break: An initial scribe is applied manually {{at the edge of the}} samples with a diamond tip. The sam-ples are then broken manually by bending both sides of the sample around this initial scribe with tweezers. Mechanical wafer saw: Fast rotating (30. 000 rpm) diamond blades ar e used to separate the Si wafers by remov-ing material of the size of the blade width. Thermal Laser Separation [1]: The TLS process is a cleaving process that uses thermal-induced mechanical stress and which comprises two steps. To initiate the process, a small initial scribe is required, which is done with a diamond tool tip or with a special scribing laser (step 1). In this case, a diamond tool tip is used. The initial scribe gives the cleaving process a well-defined starting point. During the cleaving step (step 2), the material is heated up by a laser and directly after the laser spot the material is cooled down by a water aerosol. This combi-nation of heating up and cooling down the material results in a large temperature gradient inducing tensile stress inside the material. The ten sile stress opens a crack starting from the initial scribe and the crack is guided through the material by the movement of the laser-cooling combination. Sample preparation For the scribe and break no special preparation is necessary. As the mechanical wafer saw is a typical dicing technology, it is necessary to mount the wafers on <b>dicing</b> <b>tape</b> which has a sticky layer that holds the Si wafer on a thin metal dicing frame. In this case a UV tape is used. This tapes adhesiveness can be reduced by UV irradiating the tape after the dicing process. Separated samples can then be demounted manually. Even though the TLS-technology works also normally with <b>dicing</b> <b>tape,</b> it is not necessary to use it due to the fact that no external mechanical stress is applied to the samples compared to the mechan ical wafer saw. That is why the samples are just put on a vacuum chuck without special additional preparation. Results Results of separating multi-crystalline Si samples are shown in the figures below: Scribe and break (Figure 1) : The small arrows denote the manually applied diamond scribes. As can be seen from Figure 1 it is impossible to separate the samples into rectangular pieces. This process result does not fulfill the above specifications. Mechanical wafer saw (Figure 2) : With the mechanical saw it is possible to separate the samples into the speci-fied rectangular pieces with good straightness. Major drawback is the time-consuming sample preparation be-cause of the need for the mounting process prior to the separation and the demounting process after the separa-tion. Chipping a t the sample edges (indicated by the arrows) might reduce the breaking strength of the samples (currently under investigation). Thermal Laser Separation (Figure 3) : The TLS-process results also in rectangular pieces, but of lower straight-ness as the saw-result; compare arrow in Figure 3 (quantitative analysis ongoing). The TLS-process is less time-consuming, because no special preparation is necessary and the separation process works at high velocities up to 300 mm/s (wafer saw 10 mm/s in this case). Conclusion It was shown that for the preparation of multi-crystalline Si wafers as envisaged here, the TLS-technology pro-vides the fastest results with low preparation effort and, compared to the mechanical wafer saw, with a sufficient straightness. Investigations on the resulting bending strength and a quantitative analysis of the achieved straightness are being continued and will be presented in the final paper...|$|E
