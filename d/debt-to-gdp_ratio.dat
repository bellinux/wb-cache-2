40|$|We {{find that}} the {{correlation}} between government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> and future growth in Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2010 a and and 2010 b) dataset results from outliers which come from the country most suggestive of the hypothesis that slow growth causes high levels of government debt – Japan. This evidence strengthens and reinforces criticisms recently made by Herndon, Ash, and Pollin (2013) of research suggesting a negative relationship between government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> and real GDP growth rates. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2013) recently and quite correctly noted, “the frontier question for research {{is the issue of}} causality. ” We join Reinhart and Rogoff’s call for more research illuminating this important question. To that end, we use Reinhart’s and Rogoff’s dataset, as corrected by Herndon, Ash, and Pollin (2013). Following and reinforcing Dube (2013) and Basu (2013), we use LOWESS regressions and distributed lag models and find evidence suggesting that correlation of government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> and future growth are much more likely explained by “reverse ” causation running from slow GDP growth to high government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> than by “forward ” causation running from high government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> to slow growth. Furthermore, what little evidence there is for forward causation appears to stem almost entirely from Japanese outliers. Because – as economists generally recognize – Japan is the clearest of all cases of reverse causation, this considerably weakens the argument for forward causation. In addition, we find tremendous heterogeneity on the level of individual countries in the relationship between current government <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> and future growth. This suggests that even if substantial evidence for forward causation is eventually discovered in cross-country studies, the effect will likely be small in size and unreliable, and therefore not relevant to economic policy decisions in any particular individual country. Our findings are suggestive, but not conclusive, and more research is needed. We suggest that simultaneous equations models may offer a way forward on the “frontier question ” of causality...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} issue of fiscal {{sustainability}} in the selected EU countries. Our sample includes those showing the highest government debts, which are nowadays known under the somewhat degrading acronym – PIIGGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Great Britain and Spain). Assuming the so-called present value borrowing constraint, stationarity of debts presents a sufficient condition for fiscal sustainability. Utilizing various standard panel unit root tests and the test by Im et al. (2010), we examine this condition on quarterly <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> over the period 2000 to 2010. Results provide evidence, that when trend breaks in the series are incorporated, {{not all of these}} countries exhibit non-stationarity behavior of their <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{indicators}} {{to assess}} government debt sustainability. Sustainable government finances {{can be achieved}} via three main channels: fis-cal responses, economic growth and financial repression. The fiscal response provides information on the long-term country specific attitude towards fiscal sustainability and is estimated using Bohn (2008) ’s approach. We combine the estimated fiscal response with a stochastic debt simulation and calculate the probability of <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> rising above some threshold. This is applied on historical data for seven OECD countries. In particular, the probability of <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> rising by more than 20 % {{in the next decade}} clearly iden-tifies countries that have sustainability concerns: Spain, Portugal and Iceland, from those that do not: US, UK, Netherlands and Belgium...|$|R

5|$|Jordan's total {{foreign debt}} in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP. This substantial increase {{is attributed to}} effects of regional instability causing: decrease in tourist activity; decreased foreign investments; increased military expenditure; attacks on Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; expenses from hosting Syrian refugees and accumulated interests from loans. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers {{only a small part}} of these costs, 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan.

5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross <b>debt-to-GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E

We argue that this can drive member countries of the eurozone into bad equilibria. We also find evidence that after years of neglecting high government debt, investors became increasingly worried about this in the eurozone, and reacted by raising the spreads.
