40|$|This study {{investigated}} teachers’ and Pupils’ attitudes towards the <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> system {{of education in}} primary schools in Kinondoni Municipality in Tanzania. The specific objectives are, {{to assess the impact}} of the implementation of <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> schooling on <b>teaching</b> load, class size and time expenses by teacher, assess the attitudes towards double-shift system with and without incentives, and assess pupils’ attitudes towards double-shift system. To achieve the desired results, questionnaire, interview guides and field observations were used for data collection. Questionnaires were distributed to teachers and pupils and were collected after being filled in. Interview guide were used to get views of teachers. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and frequency analysis were used for data analysis. The main research findings are basically lying on the specific research objectives as follows. First objective, the study reveals that <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> program has created a big teaching load which was analyzed further into class size and working hours particularly when the number of teaching staff remained the same. Second objective, the majority of the respondents said the <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> without system incentives was not a preferred model as it leads to overstay in the work place. For the third objective, it reveals that <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> was not a good program to be implemented, particularly the afternoon sessions where pupils normally suffer from transport problems and hunger. In summary, the study findings revealed that, the implementation of <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> should be associated with incentives to encourage teachers to fulfill their duties inside and outside the class, government must assist these schools by giving some incentives to teachers teaching in these schools. There was a need of having a library in order to accommodate pupils coming or leaving the school before or after each session...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new parallelization scheme for the Hessenberg <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> QR algorithm. Our scheme allows {{software}} pipelining and communication latency hiding, and gives almost perfect load balance. An asymptotic parallelizing overhead analysis shows that our scheme attains {{the best possible}} scalability of the <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> QR algorithm, and that the overheads are less than the multishift algorithm when n = !(p 2), where n is the matrix size and p {{is the number of}} processors. Its high exploitation of the parallelism of the <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> QR algorithm is demonstrated by an implementation on Fujitsu AP 1000 + multicomputer system. Key words: <b>Double</b> <b>shift</b> QR algorithm; parallel processing; data mapping; performance analysis. 1 Introduction The most reliable eigensolver for nonsymmetric real matrices is the combination of the Hessenberg reduction by Householder transformations and the <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> QR algorithm. Many matrix computation algorithms allow efficient parallelization with regular [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>shift</b> {{school is}} a type of school which {{operates}} in two shifts, with one group of students in the building early in the day and a second group of students later in the day.

To avoid crowded classrooms,a school may adopt a dual shift system without reducing the students actual study time.|$|R
