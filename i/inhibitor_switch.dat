50|$|Eventually, all {{push-button}} transmission selectors {{became a}} safety issue {{due to lack}} of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had horn rings, some drivers instinctively hit the steering wheel center in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic <b>inhibitor</b> <b>switch</b> activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening.|$|E
50|$|The single {{circumstance}} {{under which}} a Teletouch {{could be put}} into gear with the car moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the <b>inhibitor</b> <b>switch,</b> and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the parking pawl or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed.|$|E
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open <b>inhibitor</b> <b>switch</b> (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set.|$|E

40|$|Smac mimetics induce {{apoptosis}} synergistically with TNF-a by triggering {{the formation}} of a caspase- 8 activating complex containing receptor interacting protein kinase- 1 (RIPK 1). Caspase inhibitors block this form of apoptosis in many types of cells. However, in several other cell lines, caspase <b>inhibitors</b> <b>switch</b> the apoptotic response to necrosis. A genome wide siRNA screen revealed another member of the RIP kinase family, RIP 3, to be required for necrosis. The expression of RIP 3 in different cell lines correlates with their responsiveness to necrosis induction. The kinase activity of RIP 3 is essential for necrosis execution. Upon induction of necrosis, RIP 3 is recruited to RIPK 1 to form a necrosis-inducing complex. Embryonic fibroblasts from RIP 3 knockout mice are resistant to necrosis and RIP 3 knockout animals are devoid of inflammation inflicted tissue damage in an acute pancreatitis model. These data indicate RIP 3 as the determinant for cellular necrosis in response to TNF-a family of death-inducing cytokines...|$|R

Here, we evaluated the effect of switching from stavudine/didanosine to tenofovir/lamivudine on measures of metabolic and mitochondrial toxicity in Thai patients. Methods Thirty-five Thai patients with full HIV RNA suppression were switched from stavudine/didanosine to tenofovir/lamivudine while receiving saquinavir/ritonavir 1600 / 100 mg once daily. Patients were assessed {{at the time of}} switch and 24 and 48 weeks after for lipids, liver enzymes, lactate, mitochondrial DNA content and limb/total fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning. Results Forty-eight weeks after the switch, there were significant reductions in lipids and lactate, but no change in liver enzymes. There was reversal of lipoatrophy, as shown by rises in limb fat mass (+ 0. 38 kg, P = 0. 006) and total fat mass (+ 0. 69 kg, P = 0. 02) on DEXA scan.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) variants {{that have developed}} protease (PR) inhibitor resistance most often display cross-resistance to several molecules within this class of antiretroviral agents. The clinical benefit of the switch to a second PR inhibitor {{in the presence of}} such resistant viruses may be questionable. We have examined the evolution of HIV- 1 PR genotypes and phenotypes in individuals having failed sequential treatment with two distinct PR inhibitors: saquinavir (SQV) followed by indinavir (IDV). In viruses where typical SQV resistance mutations were detected before the change to IDV, the corresponding mutations were maintained under IDV, while few additional mutations emerged. In viruses where no SQV resistance mutations were detected before the switch to IDV, typical SQV resistance profiles emerged following the introduction of IDV. We conclude that following suboptimal exposure to a first PR inhibitor, the introduction of a second molecule of this class can lead to rapid selection of cross-resistant virus variants that may not be detectable by current genotyping methods {{at the time of the}} <b>inhibitor</b> <b>switch.</b> Viruses committed to resistance to the first inhibitor appear to bear the “imprint” of this initial selection and can further adapt to the selective pressure exerted by the second inhibitor following a pathway that preserves most of the initially selected mutations...|$|E

We studied two AD patients showing sudden deterioration of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) associated with switching from rivastigmine to donepezil after the clinical trial of rivastigmine. In the patients, rivastigmine seemed to be more beneficial than donepezil for the control of BPSD. Although It was not obvious whether their different responses to the two cholinesterase inhibitors were due to the different pharmacological profiles, ie, the presence of inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase in rivastigmine, a particular cholinesterase inhibitor might be more effective in particular AD cases.

40|$|Angiogenesis is {{process of}} new blood vessel {{formation}} that occurs under both normal and pathological conditions. In the normal state, two distinct processes can be seen.

The healing of damaged tissues urgently required the rapid formation of new vessels which is brought about by various growth factors: VEGF, FGF, PDGF, Angiopoitins and Ephrins. Therapeutic angiogenesis is the clinical use of methods to enhance or promote the development of collateral blood vessels in ischemic, thrombotic, atherosclerotic tissue. This new form of treatment is an alternative to high risk percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery.

Subjects included those who had previously been administered with voglibose (n= 90, 0. 6 mg/day). After voglibose was changed into miglitol (150 mg/day), HbA 1 C level, body weight and abdominal symptoms were evaluated six months later. HbA 1 C level was significantly decreased from 7. 8 ± 1. 2 to 7. 3 ± 1. 0 % (P< 0. 01).

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of {{sitagliptin}} therapy on seasonal fluctuation of glycemic control in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Participating patients (age: 29 - 80 years) had been treated with conventional oral antidiabetic agents and/or diet and exercise therapy for over 6 mo. From December 2009, 35 patients were additionally prescribed oral sitagliptin starting from 50 mg once daily, while 19 patients taking &#x 3 B 1;-glucosidase <b>inhibitors</b> were <b>switched</b> to sitagliptin. Twenty-four patients who refused sitagliptin formed the control group. Changes of mean monthly hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) during the &#x 201 C;winter holiday season&#x 201 D; were compared between groups using Student&#x 2019;s t-test (2008 - 2009 vs 2009 - 2010). Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0. 05. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess whether sitagliptin use was associated with deterioration or improvement of glycemic control. RESULTS: Both add-on sitagliptin and switching from &#x 3 B 1;-glucosidase inhibitors to sitagliptin prevented the seasonal deterioration of glycemic control and tended to improve HbA 1 c. Multivariate analysis revealed that both adding and switching to sitagliptin were negatively correlated with deterioration of glycemic control. In 44 patients who continued sitagliptin therapy for another year, elevation of HbA 1 c was suppressed without adverse effects.

However, the side-effects associated with this therapy have prompted a search for safer and biochemically more selective endocrine agents {{and led to the}} development of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Promising results in advanced disease have paved the way for treating early breast cancer, and AIs are increasingly replacing tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. Several large, randomized trials with AIs have been completed or are ongoing in women with early-stage breast cancer, documenting the significant impact that these drugs are making on the risk for recurrence of breast cancer. As a result, there is increasing and widespread use of AI therapy for the treatment of early-stage endocrine-responsive breast cancer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with HIV {{will be on}} {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{longer than}} adults, and therefore the durability of first-line ART and timing of switch to second-line are key questions. We assess the long-term outcome of protease inhibitor and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) first-line ART and viral load switch criteria in children. METHODS: In a randomised open-label factorial trial, we compared effectiveness of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a protease inhibitor versus two NRTIs plus an NNRTI and of switch to second-line ART at a viral load of 1000 copies per mL versus 30, 000 copies per mL in previously untreated children infected with HIV from Europe and North and South America. Random assignment was by computer-generated sequentially numbered lists stratified by age, region, and by exposure to perinatal ART. Primary outcome was change in viral load between baseline and 4 years. Analysis was by intention to treat, which we defined as all patients that started treatment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 73318385. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2002, and Sept 7, 2005, 266 children (median age 6. 5 years; IQR 2. 8 - 12. 9) were randomly assigned treatment regimens: 66 to receive protease <b>inhibitor</b> and <b>switch</b> to second-line at 1000 copies per mL (PI-low), 65 protease <b>inhibitor</b> and <b>switch</b> at 30, 000 copies per mL (PI-higher), 68 NNRTI and switch at 1000 copies per mL (NNRTI-low), and 67 NNRTI and switch at 30, 000 copies per mL (NNRTI-higher). Median follow-up was 5. 0 years (IQR 4. 2 - 6. 0) and 188 (71 %) children were on first-line ART at trial end. At 4 years, mean reductions in viral load were - 3. 16 log(10) copies per mL for protease inhibitors versus - 3. 31 log(10) copies per mL for NNRTIs (difference - 0. 15 log(10) copies per mL, 95 % CI - 0. 41 to 0. 11; p= 0. 26), and - 3. 26 log(10) copies per mL for switching at the low versus - 3. 20 log(10) copies per mL for switching at the higher threshold (difference 0. 06 log(10) copies per mL, 95 % CI - 0. 20 to 0. 32; p= 0. 56). Protease inhibitor resistance was uncommon {{and there was no}} increase in NRTI resistance in the PI-higher compared with the PI-low group. NNRTI resistance was selected early, and about 10 % more children accumulated NRTI mutations in the NNRTI-higher than the NNRTI-low group. Nine children had new CDC stage-C events and 60 had grade 3 / 4 adverse events; both were balanced across randomised groups. INTERPRETATION: Good long-term outcomes were achieved with all treatments strategies. Delayed switching of protease-inhibitor-based ART might be reasonable where future drug options are limited, because the risk of selecting for NRTI and protease-inhibitor resistance is low.

Of the 269 patients, 70 (23 %) had <b>switched</b> TNF-α <b>inhibitors</b> once; of these, 11 switched again. The median follow-up time was 52. 7 months. Three- and five-year drug survival rates were 52 %/ 48 % for infliximab, 62 %/ 42 % for etanercept, and 71 %/ 51 % for adalimumab, respectively. Switchers were more likely to be prescribed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs than non-switchers. A history of joint surgery and complete ankylosis of the sacroiliac joint was more frequent in switchers. Multivariate Cox’s proportional hazard analysis showed that the use of adalimumab as the first TNF-α inhibitor was less likely to lead to switching and complete ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints was more likely to lead to switch-ing. The principal reasons for switching were drug inefficacy and adverse events, but the dif-ferences in the clinical data of these two groups of switchers were not significant.

40|$|Lipodystrophy Syndrome (LD) {{is common}} in HIV-infected children, {{particularly}} in those taking Didanosine, Stavudine, or Zidovudine.

Practical guidelines for surveillance and avoidance of LD in routine clinical practice are presented. Diagnosis of LD is described and therapeutic options are reviewed. The most important therapeutic intervention is to switch the most likely offending antiretroviral to a non-LD-inducing agent as soon as LD is recognised.

Where dyslipidaemia is predominant, a dietician review is helpful, and the clinician may consider switching to a protease inhibitor (PI) -sparing regimen or to Atazanavir...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Simplified {{maintenance}} therapy with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) provides an alternative treatment option for HIV- 1 infection that spares nucleoside analogs (NRTI) {{for future use}} and decreased toxicity. We hypothesized {{that the level of}} immune activation (IA) and recovery of lymphocyte populations could influence virologic outcomes after regimen simplification. Methods: Thirty-four participants with virologic suppression $ 48 weeks on antiretroviral therapy (2 NRTI plus protease <b>inhibitor)</b> were <b>switched</b> to ATV/r alone {{in the context of the}} ACTG 5201 clinical trial. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on PBMC isolated from 25 patients with available samples, of which 24 had lymphocyte recovery sufficient for this study. Assessments included enumeration of T-cells (CD 4 /CD 8), natural killer (NK) (CD 3 +CD 56 +CD 16 +) cells and cell-associated markers (HLA-DR, CD’s 38 / 69 / 94 / 95 / 158 / 279). Results: Eight of the 24 patients had at least one plasma HIV- 1 RNA level (VL). 50 copies/mL during the study. NK cell levels below the group median of 7. 1 % at study entry were associated with development of VL. 50 copies/mL following simplification by regression and survival analyses (p = 0. 043 and 0. 023), with an odds ratio of 10. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 92 – 55. 3). Simplification was associated with transient increases in naı̈ve and CD 25 + CD 4 + T-cells, and had no impact on IA levels.

40|$|Etravirine (ETV) is {{recommended}} {{in combination with}} a boosted protease inhibitor plus an optimized background regimen for salvage therapy, but there is limited experience with its use in combination with two nucleos(t) ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). This multicenter study aimed to assess the efficacy of this combination in two scenarios: group A) subjects without virologic failure on or no experience with non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase <b>inhibitors</b> (NNRTIs) <b>switched</b> due to adverse events and group B) subjects switched after a virologic failure on an efavirenz- or nevirapine-based regimen. The primary endpoint was efficacy at 52 weeks analysed by intention-to-treat. Virologic failure {{was defined as the}} inability to suppress plasma HIV-RNA to 200 copies/mL in patients who had previously achieved a viral suppression or had an undetectable viral load at inclusion. Two hundred eighty seven patients were included. Treatment efficacy rates in group A and B were 88. 0 % (CI 95, 83. 9 - 92. 1 %) and 77. 4 % (CI 95, 65. 0 - 89. 7 %), respectively; the rates reached 97. 2 % (CI 95, 95. 1 - 99. 3 %) and 90. 5 % (CI 95, 81. 7 - 99. 3), by on-treatment analysis. The once-a-day ETV treatment was as effective as the twice daily dosing regimen. Grade 1 - 2 adverse events were observed motivating a treatment switch in 4. 2 % of the subjects. In conclusion, ETV (once- or twice daily) plus two analogs is a suitable, well-tolerated combination both as a switching strategy and after failure with first generation NNRTIs, ensuring full drug activity.

5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an <b>inhibitor</b> chemical that <b>switches</b> off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|R
40|$|Carcinomas are {{comprised}} of transformed epithelial {{cells that are}} supported in their growth by a dedicated neovasculature. How the genetic milieu of the epithelial compartment influences tumor angiogenesis is largely unexplored. Drugs targeted to mutant cancer genes may act not only on tumor cells but also, directly or indirectly, on the surrounding stroma. We investigated {{the role of the}} BRAF(V 600 E) oncogene in tumor/vessel crosstalk and analyzed the effect of the BRAF inhibitor PLX 4720 on tumor angiogenesis. Knock-in of the BRAF(V 600 E) allele into the genome of human epithelial cells triggered their angiogenic response. In cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRAF, the <b>inhibitor</b> PLX 4720 <b>switches</b> off the ERK pathway and inhibits the expression of proangiogenic molecules. In tumor xenografts harboring the BRAF(V 600 E), PLX 4720 extensively modifies the vascular network causing abrogation of hypoxia. Overall, our results provide a functional link between oncogenic BRAF and angiogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate how the tumor vasculature can be "indirectly" besieged through targeting of a genetic lesion to which the cancer cells are addicted...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Protease inhibitors {{and other}} {{antiretroviral}} drugs {{have been associated}} with dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and increased cardiovascular disease risk. The protease inhibitor atazanavir has an advantageous lipid profile; we studied its effects on arterial function and other metabolic and inflammatory cardiovascular disease risk factors. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, multinational trial in HIV-infected patients receiving stable protease inhibitor-based therapy with plasma HIV RNA less than 500 copies/ml and fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol more than 130 mg/dl, or triglycerides more than 200 mg/dl. METHODS: Patients were randomized to continue their current protease <b>inhibitor</b> or <b>switch</b> the protease <b>inhibitor</b> to atazanavir and continue ritonavir if given as a protease inhibitor booster for 24 weeks. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, lipoproteins, and inflammatory and metabolic markers were measured at baseline, week 12, and week 24. Median changes within (signed rank test) and between (Wilcoxon test) arms were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients switched to atazanavir (all continued on ritonavir); 24 remained on their protease inhibitor regimen. Median CD 4 cell count was 499 cells/mul, total cholesterol 204 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 122 mg/dl, and triglycerides 244 mg/dl. There were no significant changes in flow-mediated dilation after 12 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, significant changes in the atazanavir vs. continued protease inhibitor group were observed for total cholesterol (- 25 vs. + 1. 5 mg/dl, P = 0. 009), triglycerides (- 58 vs. + 3. 5 mg/dl, P = 0. 013), and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (- 27 vs. - 0. 5 mg/dl, P = 0. 014). CONCLUSION: In dyslipidemic individuals with suppressed HIV RNA on stable therapy, changing the protease inhibitor to atazanavir/ritonavir for 24 weeks improved lipids; however, endothelial function, inflammatory, and metabolic markers did not change...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} {{to target the}} long-term metabolic toxicity and disfiguring body-shape changes associated with antiretroviral therapy is to switch one component of a regimen to an alternative drug, usually from a different class of antiretrovirals. Most commonly, substitutions have involved protease inhibitors, but the thymidine analogue nucleosides, especially stavudine, have been investigated more recently. Certain trends from these studies have emerged. First, if the patient has had sustained viral suppression, switching therapy is generally virologically safe. Second, metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, appear {{to be at least}} partially reversible. Substitution of other agents for protease inhibitors has not been associated with reversal or improvement in fat redistribution. Studies in which thymidine analogue reverse-transcriptase <b>inhibitors</b> have been <b>switched</b> have reported modest improvements in peripheral lipoatrophy. Larger, controlled, long-term studies and a more standardized {{approach to}} definition of metabolic and morphological abnormalities are needed. With the clear success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has come increasing concern about long-term adverse events. In particular, serious concerns have been raised about the met-abolic side-effects and body-shape changes that have been increasingly recognized among many patients receiving ART. The metabolic effects, especially hyperlipidemia and insuli...|$|R
