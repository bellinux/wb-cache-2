40|$|Abstract. This note {{presents}} the main {{results of an}} experimental investigation into the mechanical behaviour of a composite sandwich conceived as a lightweight material for naval engineering applications. The sandwich structure is formed by a three-dimensional glass fibre/polymer matrix <b>fabric</b> <b>with</b> transverse <b>piles</b> interconnecting the skins; the core is filled with a polymer matrix/glass microspheres syntactic foam; additional Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastics extra-skins are laminated on the external facings of the filled fabric. The main features of the experimental tests on syntactic foam, skins and sandwich panels are presented and discussed, with focus on both in-plane and out-of-plane responses. This work {{is part of a}} broader research investigation aimed at a complete characterisation, both experimental and numerical, of the complex mechanical behaviour of this composite sandwich. Key words: mechanical tests; syntactic foam; glass fibre; composite sandwich. 1...|$|R
50|$|Jersey is a {{knit fabric}} used {{predominantly}} for clothing manufacture. It was originally made of wool, {{but is now}} made of wool, cotton, and synthetic fibres. Since medieval times Jersey, Channel Islands, where the material was first produced, had been an important exporter of knitted goods and the fabric in wool from Jersey became well known. The fabric {{can be a very}} stretchy single knitting, usually light-weight, jersey with one flat side and one piled side. When made with a lightweight yarn, this is the fabric most often used to make T-shirts. Or it can be a double knitted jersey (interlock jersey), with less stretch, that creates a heavier fabric of two single jerseys knitted together to leave the two flat sides on the outsides of the <b>fabric,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>piles</b> in the middle. Jersey is considered to be an excellent fabric for draped garments, such as dresses, and women's tops.|$|R
40|$|This work {{developed}} out {{of earlier}} textile research, which was process-led. I had already used {{techniques such as}} burning, rusting and weaving human hair into fabrics in the 1990 s for Alexander McQueen and for Donna Karan’s 1995 Florence Biennale exhibit. For Karan I developed those design ideas using devoré, a technique that etches patterns into <b>fabrics</b> <b>with</b> a <b>pile</b> such as velvet. I produced a series of 3 m x 1. 4 m devoré panels featuring large, gestural marks without a repeat. Each panel was individual and was engineered for a specific garment. My close collaboration with Karan meant that my textile designs impacted on her fashion designs, for example when her designs incorporated patterns I had burnt out on satin fabric that she subsequently sent back to me to add in beading. I further developed this way of designing for Karan’s “Vietnam Collection” (S/S 2001). Here I produced a multiple stripe pattern as a black print on ivory chiffon and as a discharge print on black matt viscose jersey before cutting and collaging the fabric into panels specifically engineered for the body. These were augmented {{in conjunction with the}} designer through a design process of draping and twisting, rather than drawing. The fabric thus dictated and influenced the design rather than the design requiring a fabric. The result was three-dimensional and tactile <b>fabrics</b> <b>with</b> drama and graphic energy. My textiles were used in the Donna Karan catwalk show and featured in the S/S 01 advertising campaign and other international publications, including British, Italian and American Vogue. They can be viewed online at vogue. co. uk, style. com and catwalking. com. This particular look was subsequently copied throughout the industry including in high street fashion, though the technical processes used for the mass market were different and the proportion and balance of the patterns was altered...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of laminates into primary loaded structures, it has become apparent that the delamination failure mode {{has the potential for}} being the major life-limiting failure mechanism. Delamination resistance has previously been increased using a number of techniques, including interleafing, rubber-toughened resin systems and stitching. However, all the methods proposed to date have attendant disadvantages, severely limiting their use in practical applications. This paper presents a novel solution-a 2. 5 -dimensional (2. 5 D) fabric-which has none of the aforementioned problems. The fabric is manufactured by cutting a simple three-dimensional weave, consisting of two two-dimensional (2 D) fabrics connected by interwoven pile threads, to form a 'hairy' fabric. These 2. 5 D <b>fabrics</b> are impregnated <b>with</b> epoxy resin in the normal way, laminated and cured in an autoclave. Results are presented here for Mode I double cantilever beam and Mode II end toad split tests performed on the plain 2 D glass fabric and the 2. 5 D <b>fabrics</b> <b>with</b> glass <b>piles.</b> The <b>fabrics</b> were tested in different orientations (0 degrees, i. e., parallel to the pile fibre weave direction, 90 degrees and 45 degrees), and a variety of pile lengths and pile densities were investigated. The presence of the short piles in the matrix-rich region between laminate plies is shown to increase the fracture toughness of the 2. 5 D composite over the conventional 2 D fabric composite by virtue of the energy-absorbing effect produced by the piles in a similar manner to that produced during fibre bridging. status: publishe...|$|R
