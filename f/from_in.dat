5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), <b>from</b> <b>in</b> utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently <b>from</b> <b>in</b> the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came <b>from.</b> <b>In</b> multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E

5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} aid <b>from</b> <b>in</b> the Irish Sea {{region is}} uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being said, {{there are several}} reasons to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E

5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended <b>from</b> <b>in</b> the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|He {{was still}} {{suffering}} from the shoulder injury in June 2004, and under new manager Russell Slade, Young endured a frustrating spell. A cold he was suffering <b>from</b> <b>in</b> August 2004 required treatment from physio Dave Moore as it put him out of action. Young joined Conference National club Northwich Victoria on 7 October 2004 on a one-month loan, having made five appearances for Grimsby {{up to that point}} in 2004–05. He made his debut two days later in a 0–0 away draw with Crawley Town. On 23 October 2014, he scored his first goal for Northwich in a 3–1 away victory over Forest Green Rovers with a close-range shot. He was recalled by Grimsby later that month due to injuries after making three appearances for Northwich. He rejoined Northwich on 3 December 2004 on another one-month loan, with injury restricting him to three appearances before returning to Grimsby on 6 January 2005.|$|E

5|$|In his 1905 paper naming Albertosaurus, Osborn {{described}} {{two additional}} tyrannosaur specimens {{that had been}} collected <b>from</b> <b>in</b> Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named Dynamosaurus imperiosus ("emperor power lizard"), and the second, Tyrannosaurus rex ("king tyrant lizard"). A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens actually {{came from the same}} species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name Tyrannosaurus had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name Tyrannosaurus was used.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come <b>from?</b> <b>In</b> the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
