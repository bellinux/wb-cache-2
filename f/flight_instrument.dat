5|$|Its design also {{included}} a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight deck is equipped with Electronic <b>Flight</b> <b>Instrument</b> System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic <b>Flight</b> <b>Instrument</b> System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
25|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} the crash had {{been caused by}} a combination of severe weather and mechanical problems with the aircraft. The investigation into the accident, however, found the cause was spatial disorientation following the loss of a <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> after both generators failed. Backup battery power was exhausted early, due to the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} the crash and released its report on October 6, 1994. In the report {{the crew and}} Atlantic Coast were faulted for the crash. The pilots followed a poorly planned and executed approach, improperly responded to a stall warning, and lacked experience in aircraft equipped with an electronic <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> system. Atlantic Coast failed to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, suitable training simulators, and crew resource management training.|$|E
25|$|The MD-90 is a mid-size, medium-range {{airliner}} {{that was}} developed from the MD-80 series. It is a , updated version of the MD-88 with similar electronic <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> system (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. This made the MD-90 the first derivative variant of the DC-9 to use a high-bypass turbofan engine. Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers, depending on the cabin configuration and interior layout.|$|E
25|$|Only two C90As {{were built}} in 1992, the Model C90B {{followed}} that year with airframe improvements, four-bladed propellers, and propeller synchrophasing, all {{in an effort to}} reduce cabin noise. This model also had PT6A-21s; the first production C90B was fitted with the 10,000th PT6 engine delivered to Beechcraft. In 1994 a cheaper version was introduced as the C90SE (Special Edition), with three-bladed propellers, standardised interior and mechanical instruments instead of the Electronic <b>Flight</b> <b>Instrument</b> System (EFIS) fitted to the C90B. A total of 456 C90Bs and C90SEs were delivered by the time production of these models ended in late 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Lightning was {{designed}} to meet the RAF's OR946 specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltd auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft's centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was subsequently redeveloped for greater reliability. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used gaseous oxygen for lifesupport, the Lightning would employ liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit pressurisation and conditioning would be maintained through tappings from the engine compressors.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided with a generous suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> system (EFIS), {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to convey to the pilots their true altitude or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's true altitude was in fact much lower.|$|E
50|$|The {{glass cockpit}} idea made news in 1980's trade magazines, like Aviation Week & Space Technology, when NASA {{announced}} that it would be replacing most of the electro-mechanical <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components.

500|$|The {{glass cockpit}} {{is covered by}} a transparent, acrylic canopy that {{provides}} the pilot with a good, all-round field of view. A centre stick is used for pitch and roll control while rudder pedals control yaw. A throttle is located {{to the left of}} the pilot. The cockpit incorporates hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a Martin-Baker Mk-16LE zero-zero ejection seat. The cockpit incorporates an electronic <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> system (EFIS) and a wide-angle, holographic head-up display (HUD), which has a minimum total field of view of 25 degrees. The EFIS comprises three colour multi-function displays, providing basic flight information, tactical information, and information on the engine, fuel, electrical, hydraulics, flight control, and environment control systems. The HUD and MFD can be configured to show any available information. Each MFD is [...] and [...] tall and is arranged side-by-side in portrait orientation. The central MFD is placed lowest to accommodate a control panel between it and the HUD.|$|E

An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an automatic landing system facilitates CAT IIIb instrument landings in low visibility situations. The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with [...] minimum visibility in 1984. On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the Next Generation 737. To retain operational commonality, the LCD screens can be programmed to display information {{in the same manner}} as earlier 767s. In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.|$|E
