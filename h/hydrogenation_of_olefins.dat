Magnesium bromide in combination with CH2Cl2 catalyzes a reaction that causes specific symmetry and chiral centers through <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>olefins.</b> Magnesium bromide when bonded to other functional groups has shown more practical uses other than catalyzing reactions. When bonded to an ethyl group it is used for regiospecific analysis of triglycerols. Magnesium bromide hexahydrate is being worked with to be used as a flame retardant. It was found that if 0.125 mol/L of magnesium bromide hexahydrate was added to a cotton material it acted as a flame retardant. Magnesium bromide was used to synthesize the first stable magnesium silylenoid. A silylenoid is a compound that contains R2SiMX (M is metal and R is an organic moiety). Traditionally only lithium, potassium, and sodium could be used. The magnesium silylenoid is synthesized through the addition of magnesium bromide to lithium lithium methyl bromosilylenoid. The magnesium atom replaces the lithium in the complex and has a bromide attached to it. This complex is stable at room temperature.|$|E

Studies done on the electronic differences between acyclic, monocyclic and bicyclic phosphite esters (Part I) were used to explain the differences in catalytic properties of the complexes of the various phosphites (Parts II, III and IV);Superior catalytic activities in olefin isomerization and hydrocyanation were shown by NiL(, 4) complexes of the 4, 6 -disubstituted phosphorinanes compared to the NiL(, 4) complexes of the unsubstituted and 5, 5 -disubstituted phosphorinanes, acyclic phosphites, five-membered monocyclic phosphites and bicyclic phosphites. This property has been attributed to optimum steric effects in NiL(, 4) complexes of the 4, 6 -disubstituted phosphorinanes for ligand dissociation and coordination of olefins. The observed inactivity of the NiL(, 4) complexes of the bicyclic phosphites and five-membered monocyclic phosphites has been attributed to the poor basicity of such phosphites and hence, of their NiL(, 4) complexes.
