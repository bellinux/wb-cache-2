25|$|In {{contrast}} with the Barcelona Process, {{one of the biggest}} innovations of the Union for the Mediterranean is its institutional architecture. It was decided at the Paris Summit to provide the Union with a whole set of institutions in order to up-grade the political level of its relations, promote a further co-ownership of the initiative among the EU and Mediterranean partner countries and improve the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Partnership's</b> visibility.|$|R
40|$|The European Union’s {{venture into}} {{enhancing}} trade linkages with the Middle East, as conceived by the 1995 Barcelona Process, had high hopes but failed in producing the intended {{political and economic}} deliverables. The <b>Euro–Mediterranean</b> <b>Partnerships</b> were flawed, as they created a hub and spoke trading relationship offering few of the welfare or (often forgotten) political benefits envisioned by the Europeans. The 2004 Agadir Agreement, however, may help rectify {{some of these problems}} by helping to stimulate intraregional trade. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{enlargement}} process strengthens European Union’s necessity to elaborate a more articu-lated relation {{with its new}} neighbours. The content of numerous official documents – the Draft Treaty for establishing a European Constitution, the Security Strategy, and the Commission Communication Wider Europe– Neighbourhood – reveal the primary importance the EU reserves {{to the issue of}} security and its connection with neighbouring countries. In the present work I am going to consider the new Neighbourhood Policy as an instance of region-building, stressing its distinctive elements, as they result in comparison with the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Partnership’s</b> main characteristics – i. e. the special Neighbourhood Policy designed for Mediterranean countries. After having identified the Neighbourhood Policy’s key-features, I am going to suggest some theoretical interpretations. 1. Europe and its approach towards neighbouring countries.

40|$|SUMMARY – The Euro-Mediterranean {{free trade}} area is usually seen as a {{challenge}} by Southern European agriculture. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the economic and political constrains on the inclusion of the agricultural trade as an essential element of the Euro-Mediterranean economic space. The discussion includes an assessment of the existing EU trade concessions granted to Southern Mediterranean countries, a reference of the present imbalances of the Common Agricultural Policy and a review of the debate on fair trade as a precondition to free trade. The paper supports the view that the rural sector should deserve more attention in the current negotiations within the Barcelona process leading to a <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> zone of <b>partnership</b> and prosperity...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> Energy <b>Partnership</b> {{between the}} 15 EU member {{states and the}} 12 Mediterranean {{countries}} of North Africa and Eastern Mediterranean is functioning since 1995 with an action plan {{for the development of}} a Free Trade Area by the year 2010. The process is highly motivated by the mutual interests that both parties have. The Mediterranean countries see it as a vehicle to associate themselves with their partner in the north and secure technical assistance, while for the EU, the process is expected to create a favourable and stable climate for energy investments and to secure access to the energy sources available in the region. The policy instruments have been established and the basis of the dialogue has been agreed through the adoption of three energy policy objectives, namely security of supply, competitiveness of the energy industry and environmental protection. The paper aims to present in a coherent way the energy policy status of the Mediterranean countries involved in the Partnership and identify the challenges and the priorities to be addressed. Though a policy paper, the authors aim to cultivate the ground and provide a solid basis for future research derived from the need to develop guidelines for the achievement of the above objectives.

2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led war on Iraq, {{the lack of}} democratisation in Arab countries, {{and the war on}} terror's negative effects on freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Partnership</b> and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|E
