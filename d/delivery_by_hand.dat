This kind of distribution {{is by no means the}} only way free papers are distributed: racks in busy places like shopping centers, universities, restaurants (McDonald's), and hospitals, and <b>delivery</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> on the street, outside railway stations, or door-to-door are also used.|$|E
30|$|At {{the time}} of the data collection, both malls did not support the {{carriers}} and receivers in performing the deliveries, e.g. no centralized receiving policy was implemented. From observations, drivers perform the <b>delivery</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> carrying the goods directly to the receiver location inside the mall. Only for one large receiver (a supermarket), store employees were observed helping the driver in unloading the truck.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} what is {{commonly}} described as the "Vehicle Routing Problem" are discussed. We wish to deliver items to {{a large number of}} points randomly distributed over some region by means of vehicles, each of which can deliver to only C points. The key to any detailed routing to minimize the cost of <b>delivery</b> (<b>by</b> <b>hand</b> or computer) is first to partition the region into zones in which individual vehicles make deliveries. We assume here that there are many such zones, an average density of points [delta], that the "unit of length" [delta]- 1 / 2 is large compared with the spacing between roads, and C >> 1. To minimize the delivery cost, zones should be approximately rectangular in shape with a width comparable with [delta]- 1 / 2 and length comparable with C[delta]- 1 / 2. In order to illustrate some numerical methods of approximation, we will first analyze, in considerable detail, the routing of vehicles on an idealized ring-radial network including how one would distort the shape of the zones near the origin and at boundaries. In Part II we will generalize this to other network geometries, and in Part III consider modifications in strategy if the items (people, for example) are valuable. In contrast with presently available computer programs for which the accuracy may decrease with increasing number of points in the region, the methods described here are essentially asymptotic approximations; the more points there are in the region, the more accurate are the results. ...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the level of job satisfaction of healthcare professionals in South Africa. The exact proof depends on a delegate sample of pharmacists, nurses, and doctors in South Africa who took part in the study. The self-administered questionnaires were distributed through the use of email, fax, and <b>delivery</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> This study found that more than 50 % of the healthcare professionals in South Africa are not satisfied with their salary, benefits, work progression, and work accomplishment recognition. Healthcare professionals in South Africa differ in terms of the level of job satisfaction. There is no difference between healthcare professionals working in private hospitals or in public hospitals, rural or urban areas when it comes to job satisfaction. Principal limitations are imminent in a study of this nature. Since the study tool utilised was self-administered, the details given by participants are constructed on their appreciation. Despite that respondents were certain of confidentiality; it is subsequently practicable that they may choose to give a precise response or the opposite in terms of their level of satisfaction. There is a probability that responses of every person who did not take part in the study may have given a different perspective in comparison to those who took part in the study. This study concludes that healthcare professionals in South Africa are not satisfied with their salaries, benefits, work progression and work accomplishment recognition but are satisfied with job security. The number of women healthcare professionals is considerably higher than the number of men healthcare professionals in South Africa. In South Africa, many healthcare professionals prefer working in urban regions rather than rural territories and the majority of healthcare professionals are working in the public sector. The findings supplement the current literature, and incorporate new ideas concerning understanding the explanations for the level of satisfaction of healthcare professionals. The study results will help stakeholders to re-examine the retention strategy of healthcare professionals in South Africa...|$|E

5000|$|Train {{orders were}} {{issued by the}} {{dispatcher}} responsible for the portion of railroad concerned. They were conveyed to operators at outlying stations along the railroad via telegraph or telephone. The receiving operators would copy the order onto onionskin (multiple-copy) forms designed for that purpose, and would repeat the order back to the dispatcher. This permitted the dispatcher and other operators concerned to confirm the accuracy or the order. As each operator correctly repeated the order, the dispatcher would give a complete time, along with the initials of the designated railroad official for that territory. After the order was completed, it was delivered by the operator to the concerned trains as they arrived or passed the delivery point. The operating timetable indicated locations at which train crews could expect to receive train orders. If that same timetable did not require that a train receive a [...] "Clearance Form A" [...] before departing, then a train order signal of some type was provided to advise train crews whether or not train orders were to be delivered. <b>Delivery</b> was accomplished <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> if the train stopped, or posted trackside to be grabbed by a crew member while the train continued to move past the station. With the latter, the paper order {{was placed in a}} train order fork or hoop, either held by the operator as the train passed or mounted at trackside.|$|R
