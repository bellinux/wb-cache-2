5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> them.|$|E

5|$|While A.bradleyi {{is easily}} outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, {{it is well}} adapted to the thin, acidic soil and harsh {{environment}} of its native cliffs, where <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> few competitors. Its isolated situation on these cliffs protects it from most threats, but quarrying and mining of the cliffs, rock climbing, and other activities that disturb the cliff ecosystem can destroy it.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In ES MS spectrum, a given {{oligonucleotide}} {{generates a}} set of ions that correspond to different ionization states of the compound. Thus, the oligonucleotide with molecular mass M generates ions with masses (M– nH)/n where M is the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide {{in the form of}} a free acid (all negative charges of internucleosidic phosphodiester groups are neutralized with H+), n is the ionization state, and H is the atomic mass of hydrogen (1 Da). Most useful for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5. Software supplied with the more recently manufactured instruments is capable of performing a deconvolution procedure that is, <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> peaks of ions that belong to the same set and derives the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide.|$|E

5|$|It is counted {{little better}} than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or {{whatever}} it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> {{in violation of the}} IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything <b>it</b> <b>finds.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. <b>It</b> <b>finds</b> its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. <b>It</b> <b>finds</b> its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson {{process can}} be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E

5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. <b>It</b> <b>finds</b> its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} a rusty Sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever <b>it</b> <b>finds</b> worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree and the Hero her guardian.|$|E
