5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century.

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied <b>human</b> <b>medicine,</b> applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E

40|$|Background: Adulteration of food {{substances}} {{have been}} a global challenge and causes health effects including deaths and morbidities both in developed and developing countries. Adulteration of feeds could {{be the source of}} introducing toxic substances in meat, milk, eggs and their products with the health consequences in human users. In Tanzania news reports have cited the use of <b>human</b> <b>medicines</b> especially antiretroviral medicines in animal feeds. Therefore the study intended to asses and insight the situation. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the adulteration practice of animal feeds with <b>human</b> <b>medicines</b> by animal keepers in Dar es Salaam region. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross—sectional study conducted over five month period among animal keepers in Dar es Salaam region. A total of 120 animal keepers were involved in the study. Veterinary care givers and the principal investigator visited the homes of animal keepers during data collection. Structured questionnaires with both open and closed ended questions were used for data collection. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS/PC+ version 17. 0 computer packages- Results: Out of 120, 102 animal keepers participated in to the study in which 56 (54. 9 %) were from Ilala, 25 (24. 5 %) were from Temeke and 21 (20. 6 %) from Kinondoni. Majority of animal keepers 70 (72 %) used <b>human</b> <b>medicines</b> in animal feeds many of which were antibiotics; examples, 48 (73 %) Tetracycline, 26 (40 %) Chloramphenicol, l 6 (2 l %) amoxicillin, 4 (6 %) ampicilin and 5 (7. 7 %) Metronidazole. Some animal keepers 4 (6. 2 %) and 4 (6. 2 %) indicated to use Antiretroviral (Duovir N) and oral contraceptives respectively. Over the counter products were also detected to be used in which 16 (24 %) used Piriton (chlopheniramine) and 29 (4 -l %) use Paracetamol. Out of those who used <b>human</b> <b>medicines</b> in the feeds majority 58 (90. 6 %) indicated to use for the treatment of animal diseases while 6 (9 - 4 %) used for promoting growth. Fourty nine, (73. 1 %) of the respondent buy the drugs from the medical store (Duka 1 aDawa Baridi), l 4 (20. 9 %) buy the drugs from the pharmacy while the rest 4 (6 %) obtained medicines from hospital. Conclusion: The study has revealed that large proportions of the respondents use essential <b>human</b> <b>medicines</b> in animal feeds, majority of which are obtained from the medical stores. This is irrational use of medicines and has implication on potential for toxicity, drug interaction, drug resistance and treatment costs- The findings provide valuable information for meat consumers, regulatory bodies, clients and community at larg...|$|R
