40|$|Photofragmentation {{mechanisms}} of gas-phase lanthanide tris(isopropylcyclopentadienyl) complexes, Ln(iCp) 3, were studied through experimental photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PI-TOF-MS). A DFT-based time-dependent excited-state molecular dynamics (TDESMD) algorithm, under standard approximations, {{was used to}} simulate the photofragmentation process. Two competing reaction pathways, intact ligand stripping and ligand cracking within the metal-ligand complex, were hypothesized based on experimental data. It was evident that intramolecular hydrogen, methyl, and isopropyl abstraction {{play an important role}} in the ligand-cracking reaction pathway, leading to metal carbide and metal <b>hydrocarbide</b> products. The TDESMD simulations also produced branching reaction pathways for ligand ejection and ligand cracking and further suggested that both pathways are initiated by ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Although the simulations reproduced several of the proposed reactions and several of the products of cracking observed in the PI-TOF mass spectra, differences between the simulation and experimental results suggest specific directions for improvement in the computational model...|$|E
40|$|Inductively coupled hydrogen-added {{fluorocarbon}} (CF[4]∕Ar∕H[2] and C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2]) plasmas {{were used}} to etch HfO[2], which is a promising high-dielectric-constant material for the gate of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. The etch rates of HfO[2] and Si were drastically changed depending on the additive-H[2] flow rate in C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2] plasmas. The highly selective etching of HfO[2] over Si {{was done in the}} condition with an additive-H 2 flow rate, where the Si surface was covered with the fluorocarbon polymer. The results of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the carbon content of the selectively etched HfO[2] surface was extremely low compared with the preetched surface contaminated by adventitious hydrocarbon in atmosphere. In the gas phase of the C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2] plasmas, Hf <b>hydrocarbide</b> molecules such as metal-organic compounds and Hf hydrofluoride were detected by a quadrupole mass analyzer. These findings indicate that the fluorine species, carbon, and hydrogen can work to etch HfO[2] and that the carbon species also {{plays an important role in}} selective etching of HfO[2] over Si...|$|E
40|$|TiN/TiC Bilayers {{were grown}} on 304 {{stainless}} steel substrates using physical vapour deposition assisted by pulsed arc plasma system (PAPVD) at two substrate temperatures (50 º C and 150 º C). X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was {{used to analyze the}} chemical composition by observing the behaviour of the Ti 2 p, N 1 s and C 1 s lines. Binding energy analysis confirmed TiN and TiC formation. The C 1 s and Ti 2 p peaks shifted with increasing XPS sputtering time, thus revealing <b>hydrocarbides</b> contamination. Furthermore, depth profiles of the TiN/TiC bilayers showed that the films grown at a substrate temperature of 150 º C had a thicker TiN layer than the samples grown at 50 º C. Nitrogen had diffused into the TiC layer and carbon into the TiN layer in both films...|$|R
