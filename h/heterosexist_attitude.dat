40|$|Discrimination {{and oppression}} of the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender (LGBT) {{community}} {{is still very}} prevalent in society, {{as well as on}} college campuses. This study investigated attitudes toward LGBT individuals by surveying 50 university students in five different majors on campus. It was hypothesized that males, in general, would have a more <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitude</b> toward this community. Results indicated that majors with a higher male population supported the hypothesis and were more heterosexist than other majors overall. The findings from this study can be used to enhance knowledge and societal attitudes in an effort to neutralize any discrimination based on sexual orientation...|$|E
40|$|Sport is a hypermasculine, heteronormative domain, {{historically}} {{intolerant of}} gay men (Anderson, 2001; Pronger, 1990). Although recently, researchers have demonstrated improving attitudes in men 2 ̆ 7 s sport (Anderson, 2005, 2008, 2011), male athletes and coaches still demonstrate more negative attitudes towards gay men than their female counterparts do toward lesbian athletes (Shang et al., 2012; Southall et al., 2009). One limitation to current quantitative research is that psychology-based questionnaires of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> lack items specific to the athlete 2 ̆ 7 s experience.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how support group {{experiences}} are related to parents' attitudes and relationships with their lesbian, gay, or bisexual children in an effort to understand the development of positive attitudes and relationships and what experiences might facilitate this process. This study assessed the interrelationships among parental attitudes (including gender role attitudes, religious orientation, and heterosexist beliefs), parent-child and family relationships (including current family and parent-child relationship functioning, and changes in relationship functioning following disclosure or participation in a support group), and parents' experiences with psychoeducation and social support (including overall involvement in a support group as well as involvement in support, education, and advocacy activities). Participants were contacted through chapters of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG). The final sample consisted of 167 individuals, 110 females and 52 males, who identified as heterosexual parents of one or more same-sex oriented children. Some key findings suggested that greater parental endorsement of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> was associated with less positive views of their current parent-child relationship functioning and fewer reports of positive changes in their relationships with their children since their child's disclosure of her/his same-sex orientation. Results further indicated that the more participants were involved in PFLAG overall as well as in its support, education, and advocacy activities, the less they endorsed <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Regression results indicated that parents with higher levels of PFLAG involvement, especially involvement in advocacy, were least likely to endorse <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Also, the more parents were involved overall, and the more they were involved in support, education, and especially advocacy, the more they perceived positive changes in their relationships with their children since disclosure. The results of this study confirm previous research that explored some of the steps that parents may take as they attempt to understand, accept, and integrate their lesbian, gay, or bisexual child. It appears that accessing resources in the community, participating in supportive or self-help groups, and engaging in social advocacy are some of these important steps for parents. Additional findings and implications for future research, practice, and advocacy are discussed...|$|R

50|$|As well as {{comprising}} attitudes held by {{an individual}} or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and correctional facilities {{can act as a}} showcase for <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with an easier and more subtle disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e., relatives, and exclude same sex partners.|$|R
30|$|Being a {{role model}} {{is one of the}} most {{powerful}} actions that sports medicine professionals can take whether in the clinic, on the sidelines, out in the community, or in the athletic training room [15]. If a student-athlete perceives their sports medicine team as accepting and open-minded about diverse sexual orientations, they will likely be more comfortable in receiving care and opt to seek care when necessary. However, sports medicine personnel must not ignore their personal assumptions and biases surrounding heteronormativity and homonegativity, particularly in how their personal biases affect interactions with LGB student-athletes and their ability to provide high-quality care [15]. By educating oneself on the unique needs of the LGB athlete and appropriately addressing one’s own assumptions, providers will continue to promote a change in <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> and create a more inclusive environment to extend beyond the sports medicine profession.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 1998 The {{heterocentric}} discourses {{in schools}} have marginalized male homosexual students through approaches {{in the academic}} and hidden curricula and in pedagogical practices. The multiple discourses in schools have viewed a student's construction of their sexuality and gender as oppositional categories. These approaches have not positively contributed to divergent expressions of homosexuality and of alternative masculinities because schools have failed to view the relational nature of identity construction and its policing through heterosexist discourses. Extracts from five participants in the case studies illustrate the silence experienced by homosexual students through the academic curricula and the paradox of hyper-sexualization in schools. Discipline and support procedures implemented to combat <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> have not been effective, as the multiple discourses have created a vacuum of silence filled with heterosexist violence.

40|$|According {{to social}} {{identity}} theory, group members sometimes react to threats to their group's distinctiveness by asserting the distinctiveness of their group. In four studies (n = 261) {{we tested the}} hypothesis that heterosexual men with a greater propensity to be threatened by homosexuality would react to egalitarian norms by endorsing biological theories of sexuality. Heterosexual men, but not women, with narrow prototypes of their gender in-group endorsed biological theories the most (Study 1). Heterosexual men with higher gender self-esteem, with <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes,</b> who endorsed traditional gender roles, and with narrow prototypes of their gender in-group, endorsed the biological theories more when egalitarian norms rather than anti-egalitarian norms (Studies 2 and 3) or pro-minority ideologies that emphasized group differences (Study 4) were made salient. These findings show group-level reactive distinctiveness among members of a high-status group {{in a context of}} threat to the unique privileges that they once enjoyed. © 2013 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{arrival of}} a {{magazine}} dedicated solely {{to the world of}} women 2 ̆ 7 s sports was an exciting prospect for fans and proponents of women 2 ̆ 7 s sports.

Through a critical analysis of the magazine 2 ̆ 7 s editorial content - at the same time recognizing its advertisement, an aspect worthy of study - Weidman demonstrates how the first issue of Women/Sport marginalized women 2 ̆ 7 s sports, expressed ambivalence about women 2 ̆ 7 s participation in sports, and perpetuated homophobic and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Utilizing the {{resource}} model of political participa-tion, we identify the antecedents of willingness {{to sign a}} petition supporting employment protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people among sexual mi-nority and heterosexual college students. Through secondary data analysis, we investigate the role of sociodemographic, mobilizing context, and framing variables, including various LGBT-related attitudes {{that have never been}} integrated in a single regression of LGBTactivism. Results from a sample of sexual minority (n = 367) and heterosexual (n = 1, 707) college students suggest that the majority of students from both sexual orientation groups are willing to sign a petition for LGBT rights. Although the impact of framing variables, such as transphobia and liberal identity, were most influential among both groups, the relevance of some framing antecedents (i. e., <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> and the disclosure of sexual identities) was specific to each sexuality. Before the inclusion of framing factors, knowing LGBT peers and observing heterosexist discrimination inspired greater activism among both sexuality groups as did being female and a graduate student; however, the significance of religious factors were only important among heterosexual students.

5000|$|SDO {{correlates}} weakly with right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) (r ≈ [...]18). Both predict attitudes, such as sexist, racist, and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes.</b> The two {{contribute to}} {{different forms of}} prejudice; SDO correlates to higher prejudice against subordinate and disadvantaged groups, RWA correlates to higher prejudice against threatening groups, while both are associated with increases in prejudice for [...] "dissident" [...] groups. SDO and RWA contribute to prejudice in an additive rather than interactive way (the interaction of SDO and RWA accounted, in one study, {{for an average of}} less than [...]001% variance in addition to their linear combination), that is the association between SDO and prejudice is similar regardless of a person's level of RWA, and vice versa. Crawford et al. (2013) found that RWA and SDO differentially predicted interpretations of media reports about socially threatening (for example, gays and lesbians) and disadvantaged groups (for example, African Americans), respectively. Subjects with high SDO, but not RWA, scores reacted positively to articles and authors that opposed affirmative action, and negatively to pro-affirmative-action article content. Moreover, RWA, but not SDO, predicted subjects' evaluations of same-sex relationships, such that high-RWA individuals favored anti-same-sex relationships article content and low-RWA individuals favorably rated pro-same-sex relationships content.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Due to {{the lack}} of {{existing}} literature, the current research explored experiences of same-sex partner bereavement in women over the age of 60. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight women. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Three themes were identified which elaborated the experiences of older women who had lost a same-sex partner: (1) being left alone encapsulated feelings of isolation and exclusion; (2) navigating visibility centred on how homophobia led to a lack of recognition of the women's grief; and (3) finding new places to be authentic related women's need for new relationships in which they could be themselves. The findings indicate that existing models of partner bereavement may provide useful frameworks when seeking to understand the experiences of older women who have lost their same-sex partners. Conclusion: The findings indicate that in addition to the experiences of partner bereavement noted in research with heterosexual widows, older women who lose same-sex partners may face particular challenges, which can impact upon psychological well-being and adjustment to loss. These challenges appear to result from past and current homophobic and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> within the UK culture. A range of interventions at individual, group, health service, and societal levels may be beneficial in improving the psychological well-being of older women who lose a same-sex partner...|$|R
40|$|Social {{psychology}} {{researchers have}} become increasingly interested {{in the role of}} essentialist beliefs in predicting attitudes toward social groups. However, there is little agreement about what the term actually means, whether it means different things for different groups, what endorsement of essentialism (or its sub-components) means for attitudes, and how much this varies depending on the relevant social context. This underlying lack of clarity helps to explain some of the difficulty in understanding the relationships between essentialist beliefs about sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. In the current project, I suggest a fundamental shift in the approach to this issue. Specifically, I examine the effects of essentialist beliefs related to gender (rather than essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation) on <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes.</b> In study one, I explore the interrelationships among gender- and sexual orientation-related beliefs and attitudes toward gays, revealing that essentialist beliefs about gender are more consistent and unitary in their relationship to heterosexism than the sexual-orientation related analogues. In my second study, I demonstrate a causal link by manipulating essentialist beliefs about gender. Increasing the salience of gender essentialist beliefs produced higher heterosexism scores relative to decreasing the salience of such beliefs. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the interconnectedness of sexism and the gender hierarchy with heterosexism and discrimination against gays. More importantly, study two forecasts a possible intervention strategy for reducing anti-gay prejudice...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to explore a {{relatively}} new sexual behavior—heterosexual women kissing one another publicly at college parties. Popular press articles suggest {{this is a common}} occurrence among college women, but no known psychological research has been conducted on its prevalence or meaning. In Study 1, we conducted an online survey of students at a private, residential college to ascertain the prevalence of this behavior. Results indicated that a substantial minority of women (33 %) had engaged in this behavior, and the majority of participants (69 %), both male and female, had observed this behavior. In Study 2, we recruited heterosexual women who reported having kissed another woman at a college party. We collected open-ended responses from 77 women via a questionnaire and 27 of these women also completed a semistructured interview. Thematic analyses revealed characteristics of the social context that encouraged this behavior, including pressure to so engage, high levels of alcohol consumption, <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes,</b> and the belief that college is a time for experimentation. A total of seven different motivations for engaging in this behavior were described by participants, reflecting both extrinsic motivations (e. g., to gain male attention) and intrinsic motivations (e. g., to bond with female friends). Results are discussed in terms of sociocultural influences (women’s sexual objectification and sexualized college parties) and individual factors (women’s sexual fluidity and heterosexual identity development) related to this behavior, highlighting issues of empowerment versus objectification...|$|R
40|$|Anti-gay aggression, from {{harassment}} {{to violent}} assault and even murder, is prevalent in contemporary U. S. society. Violence against {{lesbians and gay}} men can be placed toward the more severe end of a continuum of heterosexist discrimination that occurs within the larger context of cultural heterosexism. A large body of evidence documents the pervasiveness of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> and beliefs as well as identifies the correlates of anti-gay sentiment. To a much lesser extent, behavioral indicators of heterosexism have also been empirically observed. To date, however, very little research has systematically investigated face-to-face anti-gay aggression within a traditional social psychological laboratory experiment. This study investigated the influence of sexual orientation and gender of a target person, participant gender, and whether the participant acted alone or {{in the presence of a}} same-gender peer, on direct and indirect aggression using a Buss-type procedure. Overall, men were found to be more directly and indirectly aggressive than women, providing some validity to the operational definitions of aggression employed here. The primary hypothesis, that lesbian and gay labeled targets would elicit more aggression than unlabeled targets was supported. This effect was not mediated by the gay targets 2 ̆ 7 gender, the participants gender, whether the participants acted alone or in the presence of a same-gender peer, or by individual attitudes toward {{lesbians and gay men}}. These findings strongly suggest that being identified as gay or lesbian is a powerful mediator of aggression. Implications of these findings for strategies aimed at reducing anti-lesbian/gay aggression, and for future research are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a study}} {{about how}} lesbian, gay and {{bisexual}} undergraduate students from both minority and dominant cultural/racial/ethnic groups use language for social action. It is an ethnographic study of the Speaker 2 ̆ 7 s Bureau (an educational outreach program of a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender resource center) and includes two case studies of student speakers from the Bureau. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the literacy practices that may help student speakers to interrupt heterosexist discourse inside and outside the classroom. ^ The ethnographer uses critical discourse analysis to examine two phenomena: First, the ways student speakers use Speaker 2 ̆ 7 s Bureau literacy practices to attempt to change <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> on campus; and second, the ways individual student speakers use individual literacy practices to address their private need to construct a viable self and their public aim to help create a more just community for that self. ^ This study illustrates the ways in which the telling of personal stories on Bureau panel presentations serve to build bridges of understanding between the speakers and the audience by humanizing gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people and their struggles. The dialogues that follow the personal stories show how the genre of the panel presentation positions speakers as educators and experts on sexuality, identity, and social justice. This study also details the various speaking and writing opportunities that assist speakers in developing a positive sense of a “gay” self and how they use these opportunities to create a safe place for that self to exist. ...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{authors have}} criticized “Dancing Through the Minefield”. The most {{well-known}} of these criticisms {{appeared in a}} collaborative article Kolodny wrote with Judith Gardiner, Elly Bulkin, and Rena Patterson entitled “An Interchange on Feminist Criticism: On ‘Dancing Through the Minefield’”, {{which was published in}} the journal Feminist Studies in 1983. [...] Both Bulkin and Patterson believe that Kolodny, while speaking to women in her essay, is only speaking to a certain group of women [...] - [...] those who are white, middle class, and heterosexual. Patterson states that “despite its language and intent, essay…represents classist, white, and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> which are common in feminist literary criticism and which contradict the best of feminist thought and the aims of the women's movement” (Patterson, 654). This is a common criticism of second-wave feminism: that it tended to ignore the problems of non-white and non-heterosexual women in favor of a homogenized white heterosexual feminist culture. However, Kolodny’s advocacy of the concept of pluralism may offset this claim. While she does not specify that alternative critical approaches should come from different ethnicities or sexualities, {{there is no reason why}} they could not and such inclusion would only increase the scope of the “broad critical awareness” (Leitch 2145) mentioned above. Gardiner, on the other hand, disagrees with Kolodny about the use of pluralism. While there can be no single ideology to which all feminist theories belong, Gardiner writes, there are some strong ideological concepts that define areas of feminism. Examples of this would include liberal feminism, socialist feminism, and ecofeminism. In Gardiner’s view, the strong ideological beliefs shared by these groups would “limit their susceptibility to pluralism.” (Gardiner 634) ...|$|R
40|$|In 1973, {{homosexuality}} was offically demedicalized. However, {{the effects}} of this change on the therapeutic relationship between psychiatrists and their gay or lesbian clients has been largely unexplored. Using clients' perspectives obtained through in-depth interviews, this study examines how psychiatric control was perceived to operate in the therapeutic relationship between six gay men and three lesbians and their psychiatrists. Employing Michel Foucault's concept of objectification, the findings of this thesis indicate that, as perceived by the clients, the primary means that psychiatrists used to police them was medicalization. Clients perceived psychiatrists as attempting to impose their definitions of 'normal' sexual behavior through the following strategies of policing: defining homosexuality as a problem, normalization (conversion), denial, avoidance, hostility, lack of support, and sexualization of the homosexual. Although some psychiatrists appear to be becoming more accepting of a homosexual lifestyle, {{the findings of this study}} indicate that the clients perceived their psychiatrists as continuing to treat homosexuality as a form of deviance in spite of official demedicalization. This perceived stance is partly attributable to the psychiatrists' apparent lack of knowledge about homosexual-related matters. Nevertheless, the psychiatrists' approach did not foster a therapeutic atmosphere perceived as safe by the clients. Hence, most clients were unable to get their needs as gay men and lesbians met. In response to the perceived homophobic or <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> of their psychiatrists, some clients were silenced. Most of the clients, however, responded with various strategies of resistance, including: formulating their own definitions of their problems, self-educating, withholding relevant personal information, educating psychiatrists about homosexual-related matters, refusing treatment, terminating therapy, and speaking out about negative therapeutic experiences. Overall, clients' resistance operated in a dialectical manner. Clients' acts of resistance emerged out their needs to retain a sense of themselves when confronting psychiatric definitions of homosexuality which they perceived as challenging their very identities as gay men or lesbians. The knowledge gained from their resistances came to inform and ultimately strengthen the clients' sense of themselves...|$|R

In addition, this project served as an investigation of the structure of heterosexist bias and perceived religious conflict as a way to begin to flesh out the more precise dynamics behind these multicultural conflicts. The implications and negative impact of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>attitudes</b> and religious conflict on school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 professional role perception, and sense of responsibility and professional development to serve LBGQ youth in schools were explored. ^ Results gleaned from 203 school psychology practitioners provided a wealth of information regarding school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 perceived knowledge, level of preparation, perceived need for additional training for work with sexual minority youth as well as their preferred role, religious conflict, multicultural sensitivity and sense of responsibility when working with these youth. An overwhelming majority of respondents perceived themselves to be inadequately trained by their graduate programs to provide services to LGBQ youth across various service categories including: counseling, advocating, consulting with parents of LGBQ youth and assessing risk. Given the overall high percentage of participants who do not receive this training in graduate school or in post-grad professional development, results revealed a large gap between the perceived need for additional training and the actual additional training completed. Results suggest that heterosexism as well as increased difficulty reconciling one 2 ̆ 7 s own religious conflict appears to be negatively related to the desire to promote social justice leadership in schools and fulfill the responsibility to knowledgeably and effectively meet the diverse needs of sexual minority students. ...|$|R
