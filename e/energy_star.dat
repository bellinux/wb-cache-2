5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency <b>Energy</b> <b>Star</b> award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We use a {{composite}} gravitational galactic model {{consisting of a}} disk, a halo, a massive nucleus and a strong nuclear bar, in order to study the connections between global and local parameters in a realistic dynamical system. The local model is con-structed from a two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator and can be derived by expanding the global model {{in the vicinity of}} the central stable Lagrange equilibrium point. The frequencies of oscillations are not arbitrary, but they are connected with all the parameters involved with the global model. Moreover, the value of the local energy is also connected with the value of the global energy. Low and high <b>energy</b> <b>stars</b> in the global model display chaotic motion. Comparison with previous research reveals that the presence of the massive nucleus is responsible for the chaotic motion of the low <b>energy</b> <b>stars.</b> In the local motion, the low <b>energy</b> <b>stars</b> show interesting res-onance phenomena, but the chaotic motion, if any, is negligible. On the contrary, the high <b>energy</b> <b>stars</b> do not show bounded motion in the local model. This is an indication of particular activity near the center of galaxies possessing massive nuclei.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of strange stars mixed with dark energy {{to be one}} of candidates for dark <b>energy</b> <b>stars</b> is the main issue of the present study. Our investigation shows that quark matter is acting as dark energy after certain yet unknown critical condition inside the quark stars. Our proposed model reveals that strange stars mixed with dark energy feature not only a physically acceptable stable model but also mimic characteristics of dark <b>energy</b> <b>stars.</b> The plausible connections are shown through the mass-radius relation as well as the entropy and temperature.
