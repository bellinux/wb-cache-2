The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} <b>intervening</b> <b>cause.</b> A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury.

For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E

50|$|For example, if a {{defendant}} had carelessly spilled gasoline near {{a pile of}} cigarette butts in an alley behind a bar, {{the fact that a}} bar patron later carelessly threw a cigarette butt into the gasoline would be deemed a foreseeable <b>intervening</b> <b>cause,</b> and would not absolve the defendant of tort liability.

50|$|Direct {{causation}} is {{a minority}} test, which addresses only the metaphysical concept of causation. It {{does not matter}} how foreseeable the result as long as what the negligent party's physical action can be tied to what actually happened. The main thrust of direct causation {{is that there are}} no intervening causes between an act and the resulting harm. An <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> has several requirements: it must 1) be independent of the original act, 2) be a voluntary human act or an abnormal natural event, and 3) occur in time between the original act and the harm.|$|E
50|$|The victim's {{pre-existing}} physical susceptibilities are, by logical definition, {{never an}} <b>intervening</b> <b>cause.</b> Where, therefore, {{the victim was}} suffering from a physical condition, such as a weak heart, haemophilia, a cerebral aneurism or an earlier injury, rendering him particularly susceptible to harm, and thereby contributing to his death, the maxim in South African law is that “you take your victim as you find him,” with all his weaknesses and susceptibilities. This rule, {{commonly known as the}} “thin skull” or “eggshell skull” rule, comes from a number of early English cases in which the victims were found to have had abnormally thin skulls, which rendered them especially vulnerable to harm in cases of relatively minor injury.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> to be deemed {{superseding}} and relieve the tortfeasor of liability, both the act/event and the injury must be unforeseeable. For example, assume that contractor A was responsible for fencing or marking {{a hole in the}} ground and negligently fails to do so while contractor B is working in the hole. Then, a driver—who negligently failed to take his medication before driving and therefore does not see clearly—drives into the unmarked hole and injures contractor B. Contractor A will still be liable for the damage to contractor B despite the driver's negligence in not taking medication. This is because, even though the negligent act of the driver is not foreseeable, the fact of injury by a driver is foreseeable (i.e., a car falling in because there is no guard).|$|E

50|$|In {{the law of}} torts, an act of God may be {{asserted}} {{as a type of}} <b>intervening</b> <b>cause,</b> {{the lack}} of which would have avoided the cause or diminished the result of liability (e.g., but for the earthquake, the old, poorly constructed building would be standing). However, foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still raise liability. For example, a bolt of lightning strikes a ship carrying volatile compressed gas, resulting in the expected explosion. Liability may be found if the carrier did not use reasonable care to protect against sparks—regardless of their origins. Similarly, strict liability could defeat a defense for an act of God where the defendant has created the conditions under which any accident would result in harm. For example, a long-haul truck driver takes a shortcut on a back road and the load is lost when the road is destroyed in an unforeseen flood. Other cases find that a common carrier is not liable for the unforeseeable forces of nature. See e.g. Memphis & Charlestown RR Co. v. Reeves, 77 U.S. 176 (1870).|$|E
5000|$|In 1770, Milborne Port was {{the site}} of events {{involving}} an exploding squib at the local fair that would result in a landmark case for the development of modern tort (personal injury) law. The case of Scott v. Shepherd helped establish the principles of remoteness, foreseeability, and <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> in modern common law torts. Shepherd tossed a lit squib into a crowded market in the town, where it landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant named Yates. Willis, a bystander, grabbed the squib and threw it across the market to protect himself and the gingerbread. Unfortunately, the squib landed in the goods of another merchant named Ryal. Ryal immediately grabbed the squib and tossed it away, accidentally hitting Scott in the face just as the squib exploded. The explosion put out one of Scott's eyes. Shepherd was found to be fully liable, because, said De Gray CJ, [...] "I do not consider intermediaries as free agents in the present case, but acting under a compulsive necessity for their own safety and self-preservation." ...|$|E

[...] So it was a substantial factor in producing the result—there was here a natural and continuous sequence—direct connection. The only <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> was that instead of blowing her to the ground the concussion smashed the weighing machine which in turn fell upon her. There was no remoteness in time, little in space. And surely, given such an explosion as here it needed no great foresight to predict that the natural result would be to injure one on the platform at no greater distance from its scene than was the plaintiff. Just how no one might be able to predict. Whether by flying fragments, by broken glass, by wreckage of machines or structures no one could say. But injury in some form was most probable.|$|E

50|$|In many FE {{investigations}} {{there is}} no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (i.e., the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires >12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.|$|E

40|$|Joseph Roy was an {{employee}} of Bath Iron Works (BIW) who suffered work-related injuries to his lower back in 1987 and to his neck in 1994 In 2005, Roy filed a petition for review of his workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation benefits and sought, among other benefits, total incapacity benefits because his neck injury had worsened. A hearing officer from the Workers 2 ̆ 7 Compensation Board found that Roy 2 ̆ 7 s work-related injuries had totally incapacitated him, but denied Roy total incapacity benefits after March 6, 2006, because a non-work-related liver condition had also caused him to become totally incapacitated. Roy appealed the decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, and argued that under Maine law, subsequent non-work-related injuries in workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation cases do 2 ̆ 2 not relieve the employer of responsibility for a co-existing total incapacity caused by work-related injuries. 2 ̆ 2 In Roy v. Bath Iron Works, the Law Court vacated and remanded the hearing officer 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Alexander found that the language of title 39 -A, section 201 (5) of the Maine Revised Statutes was unambiguous and that the statute said nothing about eliminating workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation due to subsequent non-work related injuries. Justices Levy and Clifford, concurring with the majority, asserted that recent amendments to Maine 2 ̆ 7 s workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation law subsumed the 2 ̆ 2 independent <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> 2 ̆ 2 doctrine. Furthermore, the concurrence found {{that even if the}} statutes had not eliminated the doctrine, the hearing officer 2 ̆ 7 s decision was still incorrect because Roy 2 ̆ 7 s work-related injury remained a 2 ̆ 2 substantial cause 2 ̆ 2 of his incapacity. In her dissent, Justice Gorman contended that the hearing officer 2 ̆ 7 s determination should be affirmed because (1) the underlying purpose of workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation is to replace wages when {{an employee}} is unable to earn income after a work injury, and (2) Roy 2 ̆ 7 s liver condition was an independent <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> that cut off a prior award for total incapacity benefits.

40|$|A Response to Ariel Porat, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, 108 Mich. L. Rev. (2009). One of {{the more}} {{intriguing}} questions in tort law {{is the case of}} joint and several tortfeasors and the dilution-of-liability puzzle. When harm materializes and there are multiple potential tortfeasors, the law tends {{to limit the number of}} joint tortfeasors, focusing the final burden on a small number of actors. This limitation is achieved by several legal mechanisms, such as a no duty rule, a narrow interpretation of negligence, a restrictive implementation of the causal link (be it the but for test, the proximate cause test or the rule of <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> test), and a doctrine of remoteness of damage. Thus, in the typical accident example, if A, B, and C inflicted risk upon D, often times the tort system will filter out A and B and leave only C to carry the final burden. Ariel Porat 2 ̆ 7 s outline of the Expanded Duty of Restitution in his article, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, provides an interesting and provocative solution to the dilution of liability puzzle...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that several recent {{decisions of the}} Supreme Court show undue vagueness, inconsistency and less resolve to protect the Charter rights of accused. The rhetorical reliance on the language of Charter “values” of “equality, autonomy, liberty, privacy and human dignity” in R. v. Mabior is seen as increasingly unruly and leading to considerable inconsistency. Leaving the test of <b>intervening</b> <b>cause</b> largely untethered in R. v. Mabin {{is found to be}} unfortunate. It is suggested that complex and deeply divided rulings in R. v. Prokofiew have left comments on the accused’s silence at trial to the largely unfettered discretion of trial judges, the reby unnecessarily further diminishing the Charter right to silence. The new R. v. Nedelcu definition for section 13 use immunity protection revived the distinction between evidence that incriminates and evidence going to credibility. The author is of the view that Binnie J. ’s decision for a unanimous Court in R. v. Henry had persuasively decided that this distinction is in practice too difficult to draw, and that this key determination should not have been overruled. The paper draws attention to the Court’s having avoided rather than considered Charter standards of moral involuntariness for defences declared in R. v.
