5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works.

5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale is {{used for}} cement {{production}} by Kunda Nordic Cement in Estonia, by Holcim in Germany, and by Fushun cement factory in China.

However, use of oil shale for production of these products <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> rare and in experimental stages only.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

5|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} has resulted in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over the world wide web. When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist {{groups such as the}} Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also resulted in reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. Radio Netherlands, Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow), Radio Canada International and Radio Australia are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. Fossils of titanosaurians {{have been found}} on all continents and their remains are {{abundant}} {{in a number of}} Late Cretaceous sites. Nonetheless, the cranial anatomy of titanosaurians <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>very</b> poorly known. Ampelosaurus is now the best known sauropod from Europe. Others include Magyarosaurus from Hungary and an unnamed species from Catalonia, Spain. Numerous other fragments and isolated bones may or may not belong to any of these forms. While most titanosaurs are found in the southern continents of Gondwana, several derived species are known from Maastrichtian sediments in the Northern Hemisphere, including Alamosaurus in North America and Opisthocoelicaudia in Asia, indicating that there must have been at least intermittent connections between the northern and southern continents. This seems to be corroborated by the European find of Tarascosaurus, a Late Cretaceous theropod dinosaur similar to the abelisaurids, otherwise known only from the southern continents.|$|E
