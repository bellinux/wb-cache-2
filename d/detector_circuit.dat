50|$|A window <b>detector</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{also called}} window {{comparator}} circuit or dual edge limit detector circuits {{is used to}} determine whether an unknown input is between two precise reference threshold voltages.

50|$|For example, an {{overcurrent}} {{protective relay}} {{may have a}} AC to DC power supply for the input circuit, a level <b>detector</b> <b>circuit</b> and an RC time delay circuit. While early comparators used discrete transistorcircuits, modern designs use operational amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|A plate {{detector}} (or anode-bend detector) is {{a vacuum}} tube <b>detector</b> <b>circuit</b> used in A.M. radios, although {{the term is}} sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance {{one half of the}} received signal over the other. This circuit employs a tube with an indirectly heated cathode, typically a medium-mu triode, or a tetrode or pentode with a sharp cut-off control grid. Partial rectification of R.F. signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the zero crossing point of the input signal. This differs from a grid-leak detector, which achieves rectification in the control grid. It also differs from the diode <b>detector</b> <b>circuit</b> commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and automatic volume control (A.V.C.) bias to the R.F. amplifier tubes.|$|E
50|$|Plate <b>detector</b> <b>circuits</b> were {{commonly}} used from the introduction of indirectly heated cathode tubes in the late 1920s until the start of World War II. As R.F. tubes became more sensitive, grid-leak detectors (which are more sensitive than plate detectors) became less practical. Diode detectors were popular because, unlike plate <b>detector</b> <b>circuits,</b> they could also provide A.V.C. bias. However, the dual-diode/triode and dual-diode/pentode tubes {{commonly used}} in these circuits had bulk wholesale costs that were as much as twice {{the cost of the}} tubes commonly used as plate detectors. This made plate <b>detector</b> <b>circuits</b> more practical for low-priced radios sold during the depths of the Great Depression.|$|R

5000|$|The Foster-Seeley {{discriminator}} is {{a common}} type of FM <b>detector</b> <b>circuit,</b> invented in 1936 by Dudley E. Foster and Stuart William Seeley. The circuit was envisioned for automatic frequency control of receivers, but also found application in demodulating an FM signal. It uses a tuned RF transformer to convert frequency changes into amplitude changes. A transformer, tuned to the carrier frequency, is connected to two rectifier diodes. The circuit resembles a full-wave bridge rectifier. If the input equals the carrier frequency, {{the two halves of}} the tuned transformer circuit produce the same rectified voltage and the output is zero. As the frequency of the input changes, the balance between the two halves of the transformer secondary changes, and the result is a voltage proportional to the frequency deviation of the carrier.|$|E
5000|$|The first amplifying vacuum tube, the Audion, a crude triode, {{was invented}} in 1906 by Lee De Forest as a more {{sensitive}} detector for radio receivers, by adding a third electrode to the thermionic diode detector, the Fleming valve. [...] It was not widely used until its amplifying ability was recognized around 1912. [...] The first tube receivers, invented by De Forest and built by hobbyists until the mid 1920s, used a single Audion which functioned as a grid-leak detector which both rectified and amplified the radio signal. There was uncertainty about the operating principle of the Audion until Edwin Armstrong explained both its amplifying and demodulating functions in a 1914 paper. [...] The grid-leak <b>detector</b> <b>circuit</b> was also used in regenerative, TRF, and early superheterodyne receivers (below) until the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may {{be affected by the}} need to self bias the detector tube with grid current. Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, shunting signal to ground loads the received signal. Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor {{to the top of the}} tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward grid current will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). Plate detectors have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or diode <b>detector</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
