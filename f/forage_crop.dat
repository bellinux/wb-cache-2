5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a <b>forage</b> <b>crop.</b> Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
25|$|Some pests, {{such as the}} alfalfa weevil, aphids, armyworms, and {{the potato}} leafhopper, can reduce alfalfa yields dramatically, {{particularly}} with the second cutting when weather is warmest. Registered insecticides or chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this and labels will specify the withholding period before the <b>forage</b> <b>crop</b> can be grazed or cut for hay or silage. Alfalfa is also susceptible to root rots, including Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Texas root rot.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa , Medicago sativa {{also called}} lucerne, is a {{perennial}} flowering {{plant in the}} pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important <b>forage</b> <b>crop</b> in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, {{as well as a}} green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10–20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} different <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> on productivity and some egg quality parameters of small flocks of organic laying hens fed whole wheat or concentrates. Each experiment was carried out in a split plot design with two different <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> and two types of supplementary feed (typical concentrate for organic layers versus whole wheat) with three replications. In the first experiment the tested <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> were of a well-established grass/clover and a mixture of forbs (Fagopyrum esculentum, Phacelia tanacetifolia and Linum usitatissimum). In the second experiment the tested <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> were a well-established grass/clover and chicory (Cichorium intybus cv. Grassland Puna). The results on productivity and egg quality suggest that laying hens consume large amounts of foraging material when accessible. In nutrient restricted hens (wheat-fed) the forage may yield a substantial contribution to the requirements of amino acids and metabolizable energy although productivity parameters and measurements on dry matter in albumen showed that wheat-fed hens, on a short-term basis, were not able to fully compensate for the lack of protein and amino acids by increased foraging. Of the <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> investigated especially chicory seems to contribute to the nutrition of the hens. Measurements on eggshell parameters showed that oyster shells together with foraging material were sufficient to meet the hens’ calcium requirements. Yolk colour clearly revealed that laying hens consume large quantities of green fodder irrespective of the type of supplementary feed. Yolk colour from hens with access to chicory tended to be darker, of a redder and less yellow hue compared with grass/clover fed hens, which is considered a positive quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} and {{increased}} pressure for adopting more sustainable agricultural practices call for new approaches in breeding <b>forage</b> <b>crops.</b> In the cool temperate regions of Europe these crops may benefit from a warmer and prolonged growing season, but new stresses may emerge during autumn and winter, whereas further south risk of drought will increase. In addition, future <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> have to use both nutrients and water more efficiently maximize production per unit area. This paper presents examples of how perennial <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> {{can be adapted to}} the projected European environmental conditions through breeding. In the Nordic region, the focus is on identifying traits that are important for high yields under changed overwintering conditions and management practices. In temperate maritime Europe, the breeding focus is on forage grass and legume root systems for ecosystem service, nutrient and water use, as well as the advantages and potential for Festulolium, including its role in ruminant nutrition. In temperate and southern Europe, breeders aim to develop varieties that can survive long drought periods and recover rapidly following autumn rains, as well as improving adapted legume species with the following aims: reducing use of synthetic fertilizers, mitigating the environmental impacts of ruminant production systems; and reducing their dependency on external protein-rich feeds. Forage production systems, which are commonly found in areas less suited to grain production, can contribute significantly to future food security but only if <b>forage</b> <b>crops</b> can be successfully adapted to meet future environmental challenges...|$|R

There is an increase in no-tillage seeding of <b>forage</b> <b>crops,</b> but improvements in the no-tillage planting equipment are needed to make them better suited to small seeds.
