A cooling path is provided between {{the outside of the}} guard vessel that surrounds the Core-unit. Any heatup of the Core-unit will <b>increase</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the guard vessel, in turn <b>increasing</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the natural circulation gas.

30|$|The moment–curvature {{behavior}} of RCB is linear up {{to a specific}} zone, within which the concrete and the internal rebars continuously act against the exerted forces. Such consistency in concrete and steel behaviors dissipates with increased loading. The concrete experiences cracks and the thermal cracks develop into deeper cracks. The moment–curvature diagram entered its non-linear region at lower moments and higher deformations as the RCB absorbed greater heat. Moreover, as the pre-loading temperature in RBC rose, the maximum curvature within the linear (MR) range occurred at greater deformation and lower power. <b>Increased</b> <b>heat</b> led <b>to</b> decreased MY (maximum yield strength of the beam). The curvature of the non-linear range in the heated RCB diagram decreased with <b>increasing</b> <b>heat,</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> diagram width.|$|R

40|$|The {{partitioning}} of heat {{between two}} sliding bodies depends strongly {{on the relative}} magnitude of the thermal characteristics of each body. Grinding with the superabrasive CBN (cubic boron nitride) gives the favourable condition of a high thermal conductivity wheel, allowing <b>increased</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> be carried away by the grinding wheel. This reduces the temperatures experienced by the workpiece. In this paper different methods of theoretical partitioning in grinding are reviewed. The partition ratio is {{the proportion of the}} total grinding energy that enters the workpiece. The partition ratio in surface grinding was measured using a thermocouple technique. Theoretical models for predicting the partition ratio were correlated with measured results to establish the effective thermal properties 01 CBN and aluminium oxide abrasives. The effective thermal conductioity of CBN was found to be considerably lower than the reported theoretical value.

40|$|Cement paste was {{replaced}} with kaolin-bentonite. The specimens were exposed to elevated temperature for 3 hours in a ceramic furnace and cooled down to room temperature. After cooling, the effect of kaolin-bentonite (particles sized of < 45 μm) on hydration, rehydration, surface roughness and compressive strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste were investigated. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to study surface roughness of OPC paste-additive mixture. The application of fire on OPC paste was analyzed. The results showed imposed heat (500 oC for 3 hours) accelerates the hydration process of OPC, and reduces setting time. <b>Increased</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> 1000 oC, leads to zero compressive strength of specimens, the compressive strength of OPC continuously reduces after specimen has fully cooled down. A method for recovery of compressive strength of OPC after offing fire has been suggested. The method of offing fire has important effects on the compressive strength of concrete. The best results for specimen content are cement-kaolin-bentonite paste, exposure to 500 o C, after 90 days of curing, and cooling down in water. In this case the compressive strength has been increased around 60 % compared to not using additive and not exposing <b>to</b> <b>heat...</b>|$|R

5000|$|On {{the third}} EVA of the mission, two {{areas on the}} {{underside}} of the shuttle where photographic surveying identified protruding gap fillers were dealt with. According to NASA, the gap fillers, which each serve different purposes, are not required for reentry. One filler prevents [...] "chattering" [...] of tiles during ascent, which would occur due to the sonic booms from the noses of the solid rocket boosters and the external fuel tank. The other, in a different location where there is a wider gap between tiles, simply functions to reduce the gap size between tiles, which in turn reduces <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the shuttle. Even without this filler NASA did not expect the <b>increased</b> <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> cause a problem during reentry (it is present to avoid a level of heating which would only be problematic if experienced many times over a vehicle's design life). Since the gap fillers are not necessary for re-entry, it was acceptable to simply pull them out. An overview of the situation, including procedures for dealing with the protrusions, were sent electronically to the crew and printed aboard the shuttle. The crew were also able to watch uploaded videos of NASA personnel on the ground demonstrating the repair techniques. Both the videos and 12-page procedure document were also made publicly available via NASA's website.|$|R
