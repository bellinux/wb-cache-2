5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted to <b>emulate</b> {{the sound of}} a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to <b>emulate</b> the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{performance}} evaluation of a network emulation cluster built with commodity PCs and network switches. Physical nodes host multiple <b>emulated</b> nodes each. Each <b>emulated</b> node runs inside its own virtual machine and is complete with a kernel and device drivers. A para-virtualized virtual machine monitor ensures isolation between the <b>emulated</b> nodes, fair access to {{the resources of the}} underlying physical node, and high performance. The load of traffic conditioning (<b>emulating</b> packet delays, losses and other characteristics of wide-area network links) is shared between all physical nodes by conditioning only the traffic originated by the <b>emulated</b> nodes they host. The above organization results in an emulation testbed that is low cost and scalable while providing strict resource isolation between <b>emulated</b> nodes and high emulation fidelity by allowing the emulation of kernels and other system level software. In this paper we present the main considerations behind the design of our testbed and through detailed performance evaluation we demonstrate that our approach can result in a scalable emulation system with high performance.
