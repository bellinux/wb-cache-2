5|$|The {{origin of}} the name <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> is unknown but appears to be Pre-English. In Old English the form was Weolud and may have changed to the Middle English form due to folk-etymology or Scandinavian influence.

5|$|Responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> has resided with {{a number}} of legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While the board had overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as Internal Drainage Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

He {{spent most of}} the season with the Gulf Coast League Astros, the rookie-class Astros franchise, where he played alongside future teammate Wade Miller. He also played one game with the Kissimmee Cobras. In 13 pitching appearances with the Astros, all of them starts, Robertson had a record of 5–3, a 1.72 ERA, and 98 strikeouts. For the 1997 season, Robertson was promoted to the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Midwest League.

5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} authority <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The {{management of the}} lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E

5|$|The short channel splits into Newmill Channel and Reading Sewer {{a little}} further to the north, the first flowing southwards, and the second {{originally}} flowing northwards, when it was the main channel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Rother.

5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E

5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton. Horsa number one, {{the first of the}} three headed for the Caen Canal, carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge's platoon, number two bore Lieutenant David Wood's platoon, and number three carried Lieutenant Smith's platoon. Priday with Lieutenant Hooper's platoon made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> bridge aboard number four. Horsa number five {{carrying}} Lieutenant Fox's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney's platoon. Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell into the water and drowned, becoming the first casualty of the operation. Brotheridge and Smith's platoons headed for the bridge, while Wood's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side.|$|E
5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering equipment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> crossings inhibited a flanking attack of Warsaw from the west, {{which had been}} Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right flank of the assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of Sedan and seizing the Heights of la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of Sedan and protect the southern flank of the corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> crossing.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{there was}} strong {{interest}} in discovering a Northwest Passage that would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta, who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On {{the advice of his}} officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it Ensenada de Asunción. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled Rio de San Roque, or an entrance, called Entrada de Hezeta. Following Heceta's reports, British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist. He named Cape Disappointment for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
