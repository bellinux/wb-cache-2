5|$|The set {{has been}} celebrated by the Monopoly pub crawl, which {{attempts}} to visit all the locations {{on the board}} and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> at a pub in each one. The relative wealth of the various places has changed slightly. Whitechapel Road is now the cheapest (as opposed to Old Kent Road) but Mayfair remains the most expensive; in 2016 an estimate by loan provider West One showed the average house price on each was £590,000 and £3,150,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment, {{reminiscent}} of a traditional British 1950s working class street of terraced houses, was filmed at Carnew Street in Dublin, and features scenes of {{each member of the}} group knocking on different doors. Then during the first chorus, the group performs a hand-action dance, that was also used during their live performances. The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, skipping rope, playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people who attend the local fair or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> in the pub. At the end of the video, the group performs at a stage in the local hall in front of an audience of young and old people. The audience applauds after the song is finished. Geri can be seen sticking her tongue out and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|The Glasgow Subway and its {{adjacent}} public {{houses are}} {{the focal point}} of a pub crawl known as the Subcrawl. Participants buy an all day Discovery ticket, disembark at each of the 15 stations and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> in the nearest bar. Two of the stations (West Street and Shields Road) are not very near a pub or bar; however, Subcrawls are popular amongst young Glaswegians and especially students at the city's universities. During the journey between stations, participants are usually required to stand in the train and not hold onto any supports, known as Subsurfing. A subcrawl usually takes a whole day, and completing a crawl (drinking in the same pub one started in) is regarded as quite an achievement.|$|E
25|$|Albert Graham took Sharlene {{out of the}} {{building}} and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up and went out to the disco as planned.|$|E

It makes you feel like celebrating... It gives you a great feeling inside, like you want to go out and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink...</b> People can't wait for the weekend."

500|$|When The Chemical Brothers {{started to}} write music again after {{finishing}} the album Come with Us (2002), [...] "The Boxer" [...] {{was one of}} the earliest tracks that they wrote for their next album, Push the Button (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them. [...] "If he's in London, we would probably <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> together, three of us, or, you know, when we're in LA, he will come to our gig," [...] they shared.|$|E

Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E

If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E
500|$|Aarhus has {{a robust}} and diverse nightlife. The action tends to {{concentrate}} {{in the inner}} city, with the pedestrianised riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, but things are stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. [...] A short selection of well-established places where you can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club of Kupé at the harbour front, the relaxed Ris Ras Filliongongong offering waterpipes and an award-winning beer selection, Fatter Eskild with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the wine and book café of Løve's in Nørregade, Sherlock Holmes, a British-style pub with live music and the brew pub of Sct. Clemens with A Hereford Beefstouw restaurant across the cathedral.

500|$|Jack asks Tracy to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> {{with him}} to {{celebrate}} his impending divorce, but Tracy has to leave early to celebrate Valentine's Day with his wife through [...] "role-play". As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, {{he picks up a}} prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves.|$|E
500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. [...] A young couple who had come to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. [...] The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.|$|E
500|$|When Bart and Milhouse {{visit the}} local video arcade at the {{beginning}} of the episode, Martin Prince is seen playing an arcade game based on the 1981 film My Dinner with Andre. Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator. The [...] "Springfield, Springfield" [...] number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number [...] "New York, New York" [...] from the film On the Town, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, [...] "You call that a knife? This is a knife!", a reference to a line from the 1986 film [...] "Crocodile" [...] Dundee. [...] Ernest Borgnine introduces himself a la Troy McClure to the Junior Campers by recalling his role in From Here to Eternity, a film which modern children are unlikely to have seen. During a hallucination, Homer imagines himself singing the song [...] "Sugar, Sugar" [...] by The Archies while dancing with lollipops and ice cream cones. While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says [...] "Water, water everywhere/So let's all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film Deliverance, and the scene features the music from the film's [...] "Dueling Banjos" [...] scene. The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series.|$|E
