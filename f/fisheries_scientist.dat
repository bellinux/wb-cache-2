25|$|<b>Fisheries</b> <b>scientist</b> Daniel Pauly and {{economist}} Ussif Rashid Sumaila {{have examined}} subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets around the world. They found that US$152 {{million per year}} are paid to deep-sea fisheries. Without these subsidies, global deep-sea fisheries would operate at a loss of $50 million a year. A {{great deal of the}} subsidies paid to deep-sea trawlers is to subsidize the large amount of fuel required to travel beyond the 200-mile limit and drag weighted nets.|$|E
25|$|The {{trophic level}} of an {{organism}} is the position it occupies {{on the food}} chain. Fisheries have been systematically overfishing high trophic predatory fish. This {{can result in a}} process called fishing down the food web, whereby the mean trophic level of available marine organisms decreases and the fishing effort must shift towards lower trophic organisms, such as jellyfish. According to the <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientist</b> Daniel Pauly, if fishing down the food web continues it will in time reduce people to a diet of jellyfish sandwiches and plankton soup.|$|E

500|$|Opinions vary about Hume's fish {{theories}} and practices, which influenced {{state and federal}} salmon management for many decades after his death.

[...] Another writer says that [...] "Robert Hume's efforts to restock the Rogue with hatchery fish were an early glimmer in the dawning of a new era on the river and in the nation at large" [...] even though [...] "his motives may have been suspect, and the practice a less-than-perfect solution". An environmental historian says that while many Oregonians regarded Hume as a salmon expert, [...] "his reputation often exceeded his results".

2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what they are talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – <b>Fisheries</b> <b>scientist</b> Daniel Pauly ...|$|E

By chance, however, he met his high school chemistry teacher, Elmer Higgins, on a San Diego street in 1918. Higgins was working as a scientific assistant at the California State Fisheries Laboratory in San Pedro, and he invited Sette to accompany him on an exploratory trawling trip in a fishing boat. Sette immediately was fascinated with the variety of sea creatures caught in the fishing trawler's nets and decided to pursue a career as a <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientist.</b> The California State Fisheries Laboratory soon hired him to check canneries for albacore landings, beginning his career in fisheries science at the age of 18.|$|E
2500|$|Oscar Elton Sette (March 29, 1900 - July 25, 1972), who {{preferred}} {{to be called}} Elton Sette, was an influential 20th-century American <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientist.</b> During a five-decade career with the United States Bureau of Fisheries, United States Fish and Wildlife Service and its Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, Sette pioneered the integration of fisheries science with the sciences of oceanography and meteorology to develop a complete understanding of the physical and biological characteristics of the ocean environment {{and the effects of}} those characteristics on fisheries and fluctuations in the abundance of fish. He is recognized both in the United States and internationally for many significant contributions he made to marine fisheries research and for his leadership in the maturation of fisheries science to encompass fisheries oceanography, defined as the [...] "appraisal or exploitation of any kind of [...] organism useful to Man" [...] and [...] "the study of oceanic processes affecting the abundance and availability of commercial fishes." [...] Many fisheries scientists consider him to be the [...] "father of modern fisheries science." ...|$|E

40|$|I- We {{surveyed}} 349 U.

Among scien-m tists working in management agencies, state scientists were more directly and immediately involved in a wide range of management tasks than were scientists work-ing for the National Marine Fisheries Service. Although their views of both disciplinary issues and fisheries management reflected the problems they confront in their day-to-day work, the degree of consensus found among <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientists</b> on many issues was quite high. For example, there was both strong and broad support for the precaution-ary approach to management. Some areas of systematic disagreement were found, however. Scientists working in management agencies were somewhat more positive about working with the fishing industry and more negative about using predefined management standards than were scientists working in conservation groups and uni-versities. State scientists were found to be at the edge of the spectrum of several variables related both to working conditions and fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} and abstraction {{of the data}} and task {{in the domain of}} fisheries management, and the design and implementation of the Vismon tool to address the identified requirements. Vismon was designed to support sophisticated data analysis of simulation results by managers who are highly knowledgeable about the fisheries domain but not experts in simulation software and statistical data analysis. The previous workflow required the scientists who built the models to spearhead the analysis process. The features of Vismon include sensitivity analysis, comprehensive and global trade-offs analysis, and a staged approach to the visualization of the uncertainty of the underlying simulation model. The tool was iteratively refined through a multi-year engagement with <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientists</b> with a two-phase approach, where an initial diverging experimentation phase to test many alternatives was followed by a converging phase where the set of multiple linked views that proved effective were integrated together in a useable way. We performed a user study in Alaska among a group of <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientists</b> and managers to examine the usefulness of Vis- mon in data analysis. To date, several <b>fisheries</b> <b>scientists</b> have used Vismon to communicate with policy makers, and it is scheduled for deployment to policy makers in Alaska...|$|R

40|$|Trends {{towards a}} more {{participatory}} agenda in policy-relevant science {{imply that the}} roles and work tasks of scientists become more multifaceted. In Europe, {{the increased use of}} multiannual plans creates a need for <b>fishery</b> <b>scientists</b> to contribute with their expertise {{in a wide variety of}} situations. We identify and characterize four roles for scientists as developers, reviewers, judges, and messengers in arenas where management plans are produced and evaluated. Using examples of producing and evaluating management plans for pelagic fish stocks in Europe, we present different scientific roles and how they may intertwine. The examples illustrate that <b>fishery</b> <b>scientists</b> increasingly interact with advisory councils and industry stakeholders when performing roles as developers and messengers. The roles as reviewers and judges are typically affiliated with evaluation processes carried out under the auspices of the marine science and advisory organization International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). While it may be difficult to separate the roles in practice, we argue that it must be emphasized to be aware of their different requirements to ensure that scientific credibility is not compromised. By asking the question “What hat are you wearing?”, we encourage individual <b>fishery</b> <b>scientists,</b> their employers, and ICES as a network organization of expertise to reflect on roles, affiliations, mandates, and possible consequences of wearing different “hats”...|$|R
