50|$|Best safety {{requires}} that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> setting. The <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is the small steel protuberance {{in front of each}} cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.|$|R

5000|$|Chain design plays a {{major part}} in {{kickback}} reduction. Older, non-safety designs carried only teeth and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges.</b> Since these present a solid leading edge at the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> should an object be suddenly forced into the chain, they can easily be made to engage fully with the foreign body and launch into a full kickback. Careful filing of the <b>depth</b> <b>gauges,</b> making a radius down to the leading edge, reduces the risk somewhat. Newer chains with ramped drive links {{fill in the gap}} ahead of the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge,</b> reducing the tendency to grab still further. Full safety chains have extra bumper links between the cutting links, maintaining nearly full <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> height along {{the full extent of the}} chain and reducing the risk of kickback to very low levels. Full safety (bumpered) chains are often fitted as original equipment to domestic and entry level saws. Modern [...] "professional" [...] chains offer far higher cutting performance than full safety chain, and offset their increased risk with an assumption of a much higher degree of operator competence. In reality they are still safer than traditional chains due to the vastly improved <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> design, with a deep ramp ahead of the gauge point.|$|R

50|$|The hydrolevel device used {{in recent}} Voronja expeditions {{comprises}} a 50 m transparent tube filled with water, which is coiled or {{placed on a}} reel. A rubber glove which acts as a reservoir is placed {{on one end of}} the tube, and a metal box with a transparent window is placed on the other. A diver's digital wristwatch with a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> function is submerged in the box. If the rubber glove is placed on one station and the box with the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is placed on a lower one, then the hydrostatic pressure between the two points depends only on the difference in heights and the density of the water, i.e. the route of the tube does not affect the pressure in the box. Reading the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> gives the apparent depth change between the higher and lower station. Depth changes are 'apparent' because <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> are calibrated for sea water, and the hydrolevel is filled with fresh water. Therefore, a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes. Adding the readings for consecutive pairs of stations gives the total depth of the cave.|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{operations}} on ITER tokamak components will be largely performed by remote handling. In previous work {{it was shown}} that representative maintenance tasks could be performed significantly faster with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. In post-test interviews, operators indicated that they regarded the lack of 3 D perception as the primary factor hindering their performance. This paper discusses various techniques to improve depth perception in teleoperation, including stereo vision, head tracking, virtual camera views and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges.</b> The most promising techniques were tested. Performance metrics included time-to-complete, path analysis and operator work-load. In a first experiment, artificial <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> views were tested in a 1 : 1 scale hardware testbed with mechanical master-slave manipulators handled by experienced operators. Robust real-time image processing was achieved with marker-based objects. The simple <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> and graphical overlay did not significantly improve task performance.

Probing method with <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is an appropriate alternative to determine the screw length, which can make the screw-tip adjoin the subchondral bone and keep the articular surface of humeral head intact {{and at the same time}} effectively avoid frequent X-ray fluoroscopy and adjusting the screws...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an ultrasonic <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> for liquids under high pressure and is particularly {{useful in the}} space industry where {{it is necessary to}} use a pressurized gas to transfer a liquid from one location to another. Conventional liquid <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> do not have the capability to operate under extreme high pressure (i. e., exceeding 300 psi). An ultrasonic <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> capable of withstanding high pressure according to the present invention is comprised of a transducer assembly and a supporting electronics unit. The former is mounted in to the bottom wall of a storage vessel with its resonating surface directly exposed to the highly pressurized liquid in the vessel. In operation, the ultrasonic pulse propagates upward through the liquid to the liquid-gas interface in the storage vessel. When the ultrasonic echo returns from the liquid-gas interface, it re-excites the composite resonator into vibration. The supporting electronics unit measures the round-trip transmit time for the ultrasonic pulse and its return echo to traverse the depth of the highly pressurized liquid. The novelty of the invention resides in the use of a conventional transducer rigidly bonded to the inside wall of a bored out conventional high-pressure plug to form a composite resonator capable of withstanding extremely high pressure...|$|R

5000|$|Usually each segment in this chain (which is {{constructed}} from riveted metal sections {{similar to a}} bicycle chain, but without rollers) features small sharp cutting teeth. Each tooth {{takes the form of}} a folded tab of chromium-plated steel with a sharp angular or curved corner and two cutting edges, one on the top plate and one on the side plate. Left-handed and right-handed teeth are alternated in the chain. Chains come in varying pitch and gauge; the pitch of a chain is defined as half of the length spanned by any three consecutive rivets (e.g., 8 mm, 0.325 inch), while the gauge is the thickness of the drive link where it fits into the guide bar (e.g., 1.5 mm, 0.05 inch). Conventional [...] "full complement" [...] chain has one tooth for every two drive links. [...] "Full skip" [...] chain has one tooth for every three drive links. Built into each tooth is a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> or [...] "raker" [...] which rides ahead of the tooth and limits the depth of cut, typically to around 0.5 mm (0.025"). <b>Depth</b> <b>gauges</b> are critical to safe chain operation.
