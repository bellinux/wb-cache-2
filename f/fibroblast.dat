5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The <b>fibroblast</b> growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{regulation}} of collagen synthesis in human colon <b>fibroblasts</b> and compare the results from colon <b>fibroblasts</b> with those obtained in <b>fibroblasts</b> from human skin. The effects of interleukin- 1 beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, dexamethasone, and the calcium ionophore A 23187 were investigated. All compounds were tested both in the absence and in the presence of fetal calf serum in the culture medium. The process of collagen synthesis in <b>fibroblasts</b> from colon and skin appears to be affected differently by these regulatory compounds. The most pronounced differences were that the relative collagen synthesis increased in dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> and decreased in colon <b>fibroblasts</b> upon addition of serum. In the presence of serum, interleukin- 1 beta inhibited collagen synthesis in skin <b>fibroblasts</b> but not in colon <b>fibroblasts.</b> Dexamethasone suppressed the relative collagen synthesis in skin <b>fibroblasts</b> but not in colon <b>fibroblasts.</b> Transforming growth factor-beta stimulated the collagen synthesis in dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> in the presence of serum, but inhibited the process in colon <b>fibroblasts.</b> Because <b>fibroblasts</b> are the primary sources of collagen needed during wound repair, these results may offer (part of) the explanation why wounds in skin and intestine appear to behave differently under certain conditions...|$|R

Methods <b>Fibroblasts</b> from periodontally healthy, peri-implantitis and periodontitis donors were challenged with viable P. gingivalis. The inflammatory reactions of <b>fibroblasts</b> were analyzed before and after 6 h P. gingivalis challenge, and 2. 5 and 18 h after removal of the challenge. Gene expression and induction of pro-inflammatory mediators, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Non-challenged <b>fibroblasts</b> from peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions expressed higher levels of interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 8, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1 than <b>fibroblasts</b> from periodontally healthy individuals. The P. gingivalis challenge induced expression of IL- 1 β, IL- 8, IL- 6, MCP- 1, and MMP- 1 in periodontitis and peri-implantitis <b>fibroblasts,</b> but not in <b>fibroblasts</b> from periodontally healthy individuals. MMP- 8 expression was higher in non-challenged peri-implantitis <b>fibroblasts</b> than in <b>fibroblasts</b> from periodontally healthy individuals. However, the P. gingivalis challenge downregulated MMP- 8 gene expression in peri-implantitis <b>fibroblasts.</b> After removal of the P. gingivalis challenge, peri-implantitis <b>fibroblasts</b> sustained higher induction of IL- 1 β, MCP- 1, and MMP- 1 compared to periodontitis <b>fibroblasts.</b> Conclusions <b>Fibroblasts</b> from peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions gave a more pronounced inflammatory response to the P. gingivalis challenge than <b>fibroblasts</b> from healthy donors. They may therefore {{be involved in the}} development of inflammation in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.

After stimulation with 200 units interferon-γ per ml and 40 μg lipo-polysaccharide per ml, both HSc and normal <b>fibroblasts</b> produced significantly higher NO, indicating that the HSc <b>fibroblasts</b> retain the capacity to express inducible NOS (iNOS). The Ca 2 +-dependent NOS (cNOS) activity in the cytosol of HSc <b>fibroblasts</b> (1. 43 pmol/min/g of protein) was significantly lower than that in normal <b>fibroblasts</b> (2. 60 pmol/min/g of protein), as determined by citrulline assay (p < 0. 01, n= 4). The mRNAs for endothelial cNOS and iNOS in both HSc and normal <b>fibroblasts</b> were detectable by RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed that the untreated HSc <b>fibroblasts</b> expressed less endothelial cNOS protein than untreated normal <b>fibroblasts.</b> Because NO markedly inhibits cell proliferation, our results suggest that after thermal injury, <b>fibroblasts</b> in the scar tissue may undergo phenotypic alteration leading to reduced endothelial cNOS expression.

Recent reports have proved that <b>fibroblasts</b> and mesenchymal stem cells share much more in common than previously recognized. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate comparative studies in <b>fibroblasts</b> on the differences in the expression of molecular markers and differentiation capacity from different organs. Methods: Combined trypsin/collagenase enzymes digestion method was used to isolate and culture the <b>fibroblasts</b> derived from heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and skin. Cell activity was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Common molecular markers for <b>fibroblasts</b> such as vimentin, DDR 2 and FSP 1, stem cell markers nanog, c-kit and sca- 1 were detected by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The osteogenic, adipogenic and cardiogenic differentiations of <b>fibroblasts</b> were performed by inductive culture in special mediums, and analyzed by Alizarin red, Oil red O and immunofluorescence staining of cTnT respectively. Results: The proliferation rate of <b>fibroblasts</b> in lung was faster than in other five organs. Common molecular markers for <b>fibroblasts</b> were expressed differently in different organs. DDR 2 was strongly expressed in <b>fibroblasts</b> in the heart, partly expressed in the heart, skin, liver and spleen. Interestingly, no expression of DDR 2 was detected in liver and kidney. However, vimentin and FSP 1 were consistently expressed in <b>fibroblasts</b> from skin, liver, kidney, spleen and lung. nanog expression in <b>fibroblasts</b> from lung was less than that from heart, skin, liver and spleen (P). c-kit expression in <b>fibroblasts</b> from heart, skin and kidney was higher than that from spleen (P), while the c-kit positive <b>fibroblasts</b> from liver was obviously higher than that from spleen (P). But sca- 1 expression in <b>fibroblasts</b> from lung was the lowest among six organs (P). Directed differentiation in vitro had demonstrated that skin <b>fibroblasts</b> had the strongest multiple differentiation potential, and the next was cardiac <b>fibroblasts.</b> And <b>fibroblasts</b> in liver and kidney had the advantage in myocardial differentiation, while <b>fibroblasts</b> in spleen only had the advantage in osteogenic differentiation.

METHODS: Expression of SMA, EDAcFN, and smoothelin was evaluated in primary <b>fibroblasts</b> from 3 patients with asthma of varying symptom severity, embryonic <b>fibroblasts,</b> and a healthy control. In addition, primary bronchial <b>fibroblasts</b> from patients with asthma were assessed for SMA at various incubation times (4 hours to 76 hours) and with different extracellular matrices (ECMs).
