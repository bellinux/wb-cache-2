40|$|Tensile {{tests were}} carried out at room {{temperature}} in Fe- 18 % Cr alloys, with nickel content varying between zero and 60 %, and the properties obtained were correlated {{with the results of}} machinability previously obtained by the group. The alloys were also tested at 350 and 700 °C in order to obtain these properties in the range of temperature compatible with the machining process. The <b>ferritic</b> <b>alloy</b> presented lower elongation and UTS (ultimate tensile strength) than austenitic alloys at room temperature and 350 °C, which explains why, in the machining process, the <b>ferritic</b> <b>alloy</b> shows much greater tool life if compared to austenitic alloys (100 against 20 to 50 minutes, respectively). In the test at 350 °C, the temperature reached during machining, the increase in nickel content increased the UTS of austenitic alloys, hampering the machining, and also elevated the ductility (elongation) that produces a higher volume of material adhered on the tool. This higher adhesion capacity, allied to a higher mechanical strength, explains the increase of tool wear as a function of increasing nickel content in the alloy with a consequent reduction {{in the life of the}} tool.

As ligas foram ensaiadas, também, a 350 e 700 ºC, de modo a determinar suas propriedades, na faixa de temperatura alcançada, no local da usinagem. A liga ferrítica apresentou alongamento e limite de resistência menores que as ligas austeníticas, tanto à temperatura ambiente, como a 350 °C, o que explica porque, na usinagem dessas ligas, a vida da ferramenta foi muito maior que nas ligas austeníticas (100 contra 20 a 50 minutos, respectivamente). No ensaio a 350 ºC, temperatura atingida pela peça na região de usinagem, o aumento do teor de níquel elevou, tanto o limite de resistência das ligas austeníticas, o que dificulta a usinagem, como, também, elevou a ductilidade (alongamento), facilitando a adesão da liga sobre a ferramenta de corte e exigindo maior esforço na usinagem, com conseqüente redução da vida da ferramenta...|$|E

40|$|Manganese is {{selectively}} oxidized from austenitic Fe-Mn-Si and Fe-Mn-Ni-Si alloys in {{the temperature}} ange between 700 ~ and 1050 ~ This selective oxidation {{results in the}} growth of a layer of <b>ferritic</b> <b>alloy</b> near the oxidizing interface. The ki-netics of the growth of this ferritic layer are controlled by grain boundary transport of manganese through the layer to the oxidizing interface.

40|$|Simultaneous triple-ion beam {{irradiation}} {{experiments with}} Fe 5 +, He + and H + ions {{were performed to}} simulate fusion damage on two nanostructured <b>ferritic</b> <b>alloys</b> with nominal composition Fe– 14 Cr– 0. 3 Y 2 O 3 and Fe– 14 Cr– 2 W– 0. 3 Ti– 0. 3 Y 2 O 3. Samples were irradiated at 600 °C to an estimated dose of ∼ 30 dpa, 60 0 appm He, 150 0 appm H, and the effects on the microstructure of these alloys investigated by analyti- cal transmission electron microscopy. The results reveal the development of nanovoids, or small bubbles, undetected in the unirradiated samples, and a virtual compositional stability of the dispersion. Neverthe- less, upon irradiation the measured size distribution indicates a slight growth of those dispersoids having the smaller sizes...|$|R
