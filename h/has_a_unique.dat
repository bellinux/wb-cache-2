Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. Scarab beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other scarabs such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates {{is seen in the}} fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs.

5|$|Due to the {{massacre}} of the Uchiha clan {{at the start of}} the series, there were only four living people who possess the Sharingan: Sasuke Uchiha; his brother, Itachi; Obito Uchiha; and Kakashi Hatake. Itachi had died prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, in which Obito meets his demise while Kakashi has his Sharingan removed in exchange for his normal eye. Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's test subjects who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> ability of accepting tissue and organ transplantation, Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage.

5|$|Each {{chemical}} element <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> atomic number (Z) representing {{the number of}} protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E

Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E
