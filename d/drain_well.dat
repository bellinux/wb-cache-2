2500|$|Soil {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the potential quality of wine. While geologist and viticulturist are not exactly sure what type of immutable or terroir based qualities that soil can impart on wine, there is near universal agreement that a soil's water retention and drainage abilities play a primary role. Water retention refers to the soil's ability to hold water. The term [...] "field capacity" [...] is used to describe the maximum amount of water that deeply moistened soil will retain after normal drainage. Drainage is the ability of water to move freely throughout the soil.

Soil that doesn't retain water well encourages the vine to easily sleep into water stress while soil that doesn't <b>drain</b> <b>well</b> runs of the risk of water-logged roots being attacked by microbial agents that consume all the soil nutrients and end up starving the vine.|$|E

40|$|The soil {{around a}} <b>drain</b> <b>well</b> is {{traditionally}} divided into smeared zone and undisturbed zone with constant hydraulic conductivity. In reality, hydraulic conductivity {{of the soil}} changes continuously {{and it may not}} be always appropriate to approximate its distribution with two zones. In this study, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil is described by an arbitrary function of radial distance. The horizontal flow under equal strain condition is analysed for a soil-drain system with a circular or regular polygonal boundary. It is found that the horizontal How can be generally characterized with a linear equation in which the flow rate of water through soil-drain interface is proportional to the difference between the average excess pore pressure in the soil and the excess pore pressure in the <b>drain</b> <b>well.</b> The water exchange between the drain and the soil is analogous to that between fractures and matrix in a double porosity system, a popular conceptual model of fracture rocks. On the basis of this characterization, a simplified approach to analyse soil-drain systems is developed with one-dimensional double porosity model (DPM). Analytical solutions for both fully and partially penetrating drains are derived. The solution for partially penetrating drains is compared with both numerical and approximate analytical results in literature.

Purpose: storm water treatment, pollutant removal (suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus) by vegetation uptake, vegetation slows flow down and encourages sedimentation, cleans water by biota consumption, encourages infiltration into the subsurface zone, which reduces flow volume. Optimum design of channel dimensions, longitudinal slope, type of vegetation, and use of check dams will improve pollutant removal rates...|$|E
