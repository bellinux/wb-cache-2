5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, <b>her</b> <b>attacker</b> shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed.

50|$|Daphne steadfastly {{refuses to}} support the {{prosecution}} of Hari and the others for rape. She insists that <b>her</b> <b>attackers</b> were peasants and included at least one Muslim (although she was blindfolded, she {{could tell he was}} circumcised) and could not be young, educated Hindus like Hari and his acquaintances who have been taken into custody. The inquest is frustrated when Daphne threatens to testify that, for all she knows, <b>her</b> <b>attackers</b> could have been Englishmen.|$|R
5|$|Steph {{refrained from}} harassing Lisa until she {{discovered}} that Lisa's brother-in-law was <b>her</b> <b>attacker.</b> The relentless bullying starts again; but Steph's father eventually catches Steph unleashing a cruel and vicious physical attack on a tearful Lisa, and pulls Steph off her; angry that his daughter was capable of performing such a cruel act, Johnno then orders her to leave Lisa alone.

5|$|In 2001, British {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, {{to locate}} the wreck of Hood, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and <b>her</b> <b>attacker,</b> Bismarck. This was {{to be used for}} a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle. This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate Hoods resting place. Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of Hood with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, Ted Briggs.|$|E

50|$|Once {{inside the}} car on Newton Road, Cobby had been ordered to strip off her clothes but refused, begging <b>her</b> <b>attackers</b> to let <b>her</b> go, saying she was married and also menstruating. <b>Her</b> <b>attackers</b> punched Cobby repeatedly, {{breaking}} her nose and both cheekbones, before forcing her to perform fellatio on all five men. <b>Her</b> <b>attackers</b> then drove to a service station to purchase fuel using money stolen from Cobby's purse. She was then driven down Reen Road to a secluded paddock, while being held down in the car, raped repeatedly, and being continually beaten by <b>her</b> five <b>attackers.</b> They then dragged her into the paddock along a barbed wire fence where they dumped the brutally beaten Cobby and continued to sexually assault and physically abuse her for some time. According to his taped confession, one of the attackers, John Travers, then became concerned that Cobby could identify them because she had seen their faces and heard their names, and convinced the other attackers that she must be killed. Urged on by the others, Travers slit her throat, almost severing her head. The medical examiner later testified that after Cobby's throat was cut, she would have died within two minutes.|$|R

5|$|In the {{engagement}} on 4 August 1800 neither side {{had a single}} man killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career. Although Captain Jurien in Franchise spent another three weeks off the Brazilian coast before returning to France. On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which {{was on her way}} to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off <b>her</b> <b>attacker.</b> Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase; he then did not see another sail until he left the area.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt is {{captured}} by a French patrol after witnessing them execute an Arab prisoner. A French military officer, Comte (Richard Moire), imprisons and abuses her. Eberhardt befriends an Arab prisoner named Sayed, who is later executed. Slimene reveals that Comte executed Sayed {{in the hopes}} of provoking a war. Eberhardt writes to Barracund telling him everything; her story is printed as front page news. Shortly thereafter Eberhardt is viciously attacked and wounded by an Arab swordsman. Eberhardt believes that Comte is responsible for the attack. At the conclusion of the sentencing of <b>her</b> <b>attacker</b> to life imprisonment, the French authorities deport Eberhardt. She moves to Marseille, where she is accompanied by Slimene the following year. The two become married, which allows Eberhardt to return to Algiers.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of <b>her</b> <b>attacker,</b> who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E

5|$|In August, {{she began}} a storyline where she acted {{friendly}} and nice, seemingly diminishing her heel characteristics, later shaking {{the hand of}} rival Kaitlyn following a match and teaming with her and Layla on the September 10 episode of Raw. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, Kaitlyn was attacked and injured by a masked figure backstage, and as a result, she was replaced by Eve in a match against Divas Champion Layla, which Eve won. In doing so, {{she became the first}} ever three-time Divas Champion. After Kaitlyn revealed that <b>her</b> <b>attacker</b> was a blonde, Eve accused Phoenix, attacking her on the September 24 episode of Raw. The following week, pending an investigation into Kaitlyn's attack, Eve suspended Phoenix, which was reversed by Booker T. It was later revealed that Kaitlyn was attacked by Aksana on Eve's orders. At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Eve retained the Divas Championship against Layla and Kaitlyn in a triple threat match. Eve then continued her feud with the duo, facing them in tag team matches with various partners, and defeating Kaitlyn at Survivor Series to retain the championship. At , she defeated Naomi to retain the title. After winning a non-title match against Eve, Kaitlyn went on to defeat Eve by disqualification on December 18, with Eve retaining the championship. A rematch occurred on the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, in which Eve successfully defended the championship after losing the match via count-out. The following week, Eve dropped the Divas Championship to Kaitlyn. Following the loss, Eve immediately quit WWE in storyline. In reality, Torres had asked for her release from the company in December 2012 to focus on her role as an instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered self-defense program.|$|E

25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by <b>her</b> <b>attacker.</b> The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than five inches. This man was also clean shaven. After investigating the suspect, officers {{did not believe the}} man was the Phantom. According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could not have been in Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept him in jail for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as <b>her</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2004, a University of New Mexico {{student was}} beaten and raped, before {{escaping}} and identifying Joel Patrick Courtney as <b>her</b> <b>attacker.</b> On September 12, 2007, Courtney {{pleaded guilty to}} the beating and rape of the 22-year-old University of New Mexico foreign exchange student.

Later, after the second double murder, Texas Ranger Joe Thompson flew to Frederick to question her again.|$|E

5000|$|Lāčplēsis, the eponymous {{hero of the}} Latvian epic poem. It is {{said that}} he will rise out of the Daugava River when his country needs him to again take on <b>her</b> <b>attackers</b> and invaders. Alternatively, he will rise out of the Daugava {{at the end of}} the world.|$|R

25|$|This time, sensing an easy capture as her quarry {{appeared}} unready,General Ernouf came alongside {{and attempted}} to board. The two vessels exchanged both cannon and small arms fire, with Britannia twice repulsing boarding attempts. After the engagement left both vessels with severely damaged masts and rigging, Général Ernouf withdrew, with Britannia in pursuit; however, Britannia lost <b>her</b> <b>attacker</b> in the dark after night fell. Britannia had one man killed (a passenger who had volunteered his services), and four wounded, Leavey among them.|$|E
25|$|Inside, a key {{aspect of}} the crime scene was also {{inconsistent}} with the burglary theory. At {{the top of the stairs}} was a stack of stereo equipment atop a VCR. If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and <b>her</b> <b>attacker</b> had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked downstairs and scattered as well. It made more sense to assume that it had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|In early January 2017, it was {{reported}} that Kvitová's recovery was going according to plan, and that she had gradually begun doing exercises with her injured fingers.
