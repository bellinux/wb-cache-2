5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity. On June 1, 2016, the Rockets named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard opted out of {{the final year of}} his contract later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. With Howard gone, <b>Harden</b> was now the undisputed franchise player. <b>Harden</b> reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. The Rockets also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented <b>Harden</b> and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E

5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without <b>Harden</b> {{also on the}} court. Lin and <b>Harden</b> were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured <b>Harden.</b> It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received a round of applause upon entering the game, though it was more subdued than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both <b>Harden</b> and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured right hand. On February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket to notch a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E

40|$|Steel shafts can be <b>hardened</b> by laser {{using one}} {{continuous}} spiral track. This method however {{leads to a}} <b>hardening</b> zone which is not homogeneous in surface hardness and case depth. This is primarily due to the hemispherical shape of the <b>hardening</b> track {{as well as to}} tempering effects between two neighbouring tracks of the spiral. A new method was developed to solve this problem for cylindrical shafts. The laser <b>hardening</b> was performed by rotating the shafts at a very high speed and by heating the shaft with two high power diode lasers of 6 kW each equipped with fiber optics. At the start the shaft is shortly preheated to attain the required <b>hardening</b> temperature. After preheating, the lasers moved along the axis to obtain a continuous <b>hardening</b> zone. Initial <b>hardening</b> tests were performed with 30 mm shafts made of low alloyed steel 42 CrMo 4 V and later the same method was applied for the <b>hardening</b> of shafts with larger diameters up to 60 mm without overlapping. A second application of high speed rotation <b>hardening</b> by diode laser was the inside <b>hardening</b> of small holes drilled in 20 mm steel plates. With other techniques like induction <b>hardening</b> and conventional laser <b>hardening,</b> only a part of the inside surface can be <b>hardened</b> with heterogeneous <b>hardening</b> zones because of overlapping and tempering. The diameters of the holes were 10 and 20 mm. Two steels were tested: 42 CrMo 4 and X 42 Cr 13. By using a fast rotating mirror and a 6 kW diode laser, the inside surface of the holes were <b>hardened</b> with high precision and without overlapping effects. The resulting <b>hardening</b> zones o f both shafts and holes are very homogeneous in hardness and depth. Therefore, the method looks very promising as a new and flexible <b>hardening</b> technique for the heat treatment of shafts, which can compete with other methods like induction <b>hardening.</b> For inside <b>hardening</b> of holes, the described method is even better than induction method especially for <b>hardening</b> small diameter holes...|$|R

5|$|With double-digits wins {{against the}} Lakers, Utah, Boston and Philadelphia {{to start the}} 2014–15 NBA season, the Rockets {{recorded}} a 4-0 start {{for the first time}} since they won their first six games of the 1996–97 season. By recording double-digit wins against Miami and San Antonio in their next two games, the Rockets won each of their first six games by 10 points or more, and became the first team to accomplish the feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. In December, the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer and Josh Smith, two veterans who added depth to the roster. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James <b>Harden</b> took it upon himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, which turned him into an MVP front-runner. On March 20, 2015, <b>Harden</b> scored a career-high 50 points in a 118–108 victory over the Nuggets. <b>Harden</b> became the first Rocket to score 50 points since Hakeem Olajuwon scored 51 against the Celtics in 1996. On April 1, <b>Harden</b> scored 51 points in a 115–111 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets won their 56th game of the season and finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. On that same night, the Rockets claimed their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994. In the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4-1 in the first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Los Angeles Clippers built a 3-1 lead over the Rockets, before the Rockets won the last three games in the series to return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years, this time against the Golden State Warriors. With their win over the Clippers, the Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3-1 deficit. In the Conference Finals, the Warriors won the first three games before <b>Harden</b> scored 45 points to win Game 4 at the Toyota Center.

40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface <b>hardening</b> {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the <b>hardening</b> structure {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The <b>hardening</b> structure formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the <b>hardening</b> structure. To produce the <b>hardening</b> structure would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface <b>hardening</b> samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While through <b>hardening</b> the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial <b>hardening</b> the <b>hardening</b> interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The depth of <b>hardening</b> zone of samples with through <b>hardening</b> layers is 0, 5 mm; the depth of <b>hardening</b> zone of partial <b>hardening</b> samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the through <b>hardening</b> layers is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial <b>hardening</b> layers. The metallographic analysis shows that the <b>hardening</b> zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the <b>hardening</b> structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the surface grinding-hardening test, the {{influence}} of depth of cut and original microstructure on the <b>hardened</b> layer depth, microstructure and micro-hardness of the <b>hardened</b> layer were studied.

The completely <b>hardened</b> region is composed of mixed martensite, residual austerities and a little carbide. There were no remarkable effects of the depth of cut and original structure on the martensite configuration and micro-hardness value in completely <b>hardened</b> region. The micro-hardness value of the completely <b>hardened</b> region can be up to 750 - 780 HV. However, microstructure of the transitional region varies with different original structure.
