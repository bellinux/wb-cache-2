This was a complete contrast to the buff <b>funnels</b> <b>with</b> a black top and white dividing line used by the grey hulled Ellerman Lines' vessels.|$|R

50|$|A <b>funnel</b> <b>with</b> a fritted {{glass disc}} {{can be used}} immediately. For a <b>funnel</b> <b>with</b> a {{perforated}} plate, filtration material {{in the form of}} filter paper is placed on the plate, and the filter paper is moistened with a liquid to prevent initial leakage. The liquid to be filtered is poured into the cylinder and drawn through the perforated plate/fritted glass disc by vacuum suction.|$|R

500|$|From the {{beginning}} Cunard's ships used the line's distinctive red <b>funnel</b> <b>with</b> {{two or three}} narrow black bands and black top. It appears that Robert Napier was responsible for this feature. His shipyard in Glasgow used this combination previously in 1830 on Thomas Assheton Smith's private steam yacht [...] "Menai". The renovation of her model by Glasgow Museum of Transport revealed that she had vermilion <b>funnels</b> <b>with</b> black bands and black top.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel imaging light funnel. Its {{structure and operation}} principle are introduced, and its ray path is analyzed by computational simulation. The relationship between the light concentrating of the light funnel and the incident angle is investigated. The {{results show that the}} changes of focal spot size, shape, energy distribution and center of focal spot are affected by incident angle. In addition to theoretical analysis, several imaging light funnels are constructed, and experiments for single funnel and multiple <b>funnels</b> <b>with</b> series heating system are carried out. Two experiments results and heat collection efficiency of system are obtained. Experiment results show that the heating temperature of this system can reach 335 °C and the heat collection efficiency could reach 40 %. When the multiple <b>funnels</b> <b>with</b> series heat the water, the temperature can reach 150 °C. Key words: solar concentrator, ray analysis, multiple <b>funnels</b> <b>with</b> series, collecting heat experiments...|$|R
