60|$|Well, {{once upon}} a time, {{so long ago that}} no man can tell when, the land was so much higher, that between England and Ireland, and, what is more, between England and Norway, was firm dry land. The country then must have looked--at least we know it looked so in Norfolk--very like what our moors look like here. There were forests of Scotch fir, and of spruce too, which is not wild in England now, though you may see plenty in every plantation. There were oaks and alders, yews and sloes, just as there are in our woods now. There was buck-bean in the bogs, as there is in Larmer's and Heath pond; and white and yellow water-lilies, horn-wort, and pond-weeds, just as there are now in our ponds. There were wild horses, wild deer, and wild oxen, those last of an {{enormous}} size. There were little yellow roe-deer, which will not surprise you, for there are hundreds and thousands in Scotland to this day; and, as you know, they will thrive well enough in our woods now. There were beavers too: but that must not surprise you, for there were beavers in South Wales long after the Norman Conquest, and there are beavers still in the mountain glens of the south-east of France. There were honest little water-rats too, who I dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys, nibbling the water-lily pods, thousands of years ago, as they do in our ponds now. Well, so far we have come to nothing strange: but now begins the fairy tale. Mixed with all these animals, there wandered about great herds of elephants and rhinoceroses; not smooth-skinned, mind, but covered with <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>wool,</b> like those which are still found sticking out of the everlasting ice cliffs, {{at the mouth of the}} Lena and other Siberian rivers, with the flesh, and skin, and hair so fresh upon them, that the wild wolves tear it off, and snarl and growl over the carcase of monsters who were frozen up thousands of years ago. And with them, stranger still, were great hippopotamuses; who came, perhaps, northward in summer time along the sea-shore and down the rivers, having spread hither all the way from Africa; for in those days, you must understand, Sicily, and Italy, and Malta--look at your map--were joined to the coast of Africa: and so it may be was the rock of Gibraltar itself; and over the sea where the Straits of Gibraltar now flow was firm dry land, over which hyaenas and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses ranged into Spain; for their bones are found at this day in the Gibraltar caves. And this is the first chapter of my fairy tale.|$|E
60|$|When handled or nursed, it {{was very}} quiet and contented, but when laid down by itself would {{invariably}} cry; {{and for the first}} few nights was very restless and noisy. I fitted up a little box for a cradle, with a soft mat for it to lie upon, which was changed and washed every day; and I soon found it necessary to wash the little Mias as well. After I had done so a few times, it came to like the operation, and {{as soon as it was}} dirty would begin crying and not leave off until I took it out and carried it to the spout, when it immediately became quiet, although it would wince a little at the first rush of the cold water and make ridiculously wry faces while the stream was running over its head. It enjoyed the wiping and rubbing dry amazingly, and when I brushed its hair seemed to be perfectly happy, lying quite still with its arms and legs stretched out while I thoroughly brushed the long hair of its back and arms. For the first few days it clung desperately with all four hands to whatever it could lay hold of, and I had to be careful to keep my beard out of its way, as its fingers clutched hold of hair more tenaciously than anything else, and it was impossible to free myself without assistance. When restless, it would struggle about with its hands up in the air trying to find something to take hold of, and, when it had got a bit of stick or rag in two or three of its hands, seemed quite happy. For want of something else, it would often seize its own feet, and after a time it would constantly cross its arms and grasp with each hand the long hair that grew just below the opposite shoulder. The great tenacity of its grasp soon diminished, and I was obliged to invent some means to give it exercise and strengthen its limbs. For this purpose I made a short ladder of three or four rounds, on which I put it to hang for a quarter of an hour at a time. At first it seemed much pleased, but it could not get all four hands in a comfortable position, and, after changing about several times, would leave hold of one hand after the other, and drop onto the floor. Sometimes when hanging only by two hands, it would loose one, and cross it to the opposite shoulder, grasping its own hair; and, as this seemed much more agreeable than the stick, it would then loose the other and tumble down, when it would cross both and lie on its back quite contentedly, never seeming to be hurt by its numerous tumbles. Finding it so fond of hair, I endeavoured to make an artificial mother, by wrapping up a piece of buffalo-skin into a bundle, and suspending it about a foot from the floor. At first this seemed to suit it admirably, as it could sprawl its legs about and always find some hair, which it grasped with the greatest tenacity. I was now in hopes that I had made the little orphan quite happy; and so it seemed for some time, until it began to remember its lost parent, and try to suck. It would pull itself up close to the skin, and try about everywhere for a likely place; but, as it only succeeded in getting mouthfuls of <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>wool,</b> it would be greatly disgusted, and scream violently, and, after two or three attempts, let go altogether. One day it got some wool into its throat, and I thought it would have choked, but after much gasping it recovered, and I was obliged to take the imitation mother to pieces again, and give up this last attempt to exercise the little creature.|$|E

The velocities of protein extraction by the Shindai method were 1. 1 − 1. 8 fold faster than those by the conventional method. The protein components mainly consisted of β-keratin. Protein films with white color were formed from β-keratin solution by Pre-cast, Post-cast, and soft Post-cast methods, which were effectively applicable for {{the conversion of}} α-keratin into protein films.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance, growth, slaughter traits, {{and several}} conformation characteristics in Dorper sheep (<b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> types) were evaluated under extensive {{conditions in the}} north-western Karoo region of South Africa. From 1993 to 2000, lambs of hair (n= 1070) and wool (n= 1044) type Dorper sheep, and corresponding reproductive records from 872 and 874, respectively, were analysed. There was {{no significant differences between}} <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> type lambs for body weight from 42 days till 12 months of age, and for pre- or post-weaning growth rate. The analysis of conformation tend to suggest that the hair type lambs were blockier with shorter legs, compared to the leggier appearance of the wool type lambs. This is also evident from the longer carcass length (108. 5 vs. 107. 2 cm) and hind leg length of wool type lambs compared to hair type lambs. With regard to other carcass traits, wool type lambs had heavier carcasses (19. 6 vs. 19. 2 kg) and higher dressing percentage (49. 9 vs. 49. 0 %), though, fat measurements and carcass grades were similar. The ewes of the hair type were heavier at mating than wool type (57. 4 vs. 56. 4 kg). No differences were, however, observed for percentage of ewes lambed, lambs born, lambs weaned, survival rate of lambs or kg lamb produced per ewe per year.
