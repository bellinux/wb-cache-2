5|$|Berger {{had been}} remarkably successful, despite the {{obstacles}} placed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path</b> by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 {{men for the}} Waffen-SS between mid-January {{and the end of}} June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; {{he had no choice}} but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path,</b> both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E

As God in mercy will guide, so by {{the same}} he will uphold our goings <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paths.</b> We are weak, {{wherefore}} though the path we go in were never so plain, yet we are apt to stumble and fall. But 'when I said my foot slippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up' (Psa 94:18). Wherefore we should always turn our hope into prayer, and say, Lord, 'hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not' (Psa 17:5). Be not moved; let mercy follow me.|$|R

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{eventually}} {{discovers the}} game's location and sends a SWAT team, who are sealed {{in another room}} and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse {{sitting in front of}} several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E

He was called up to Turkish side by Guus Hiddink for the friendly match against the Netherlands. On 29 March 2011, Ekici represented Turkey <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first major international match against Austria where he played right-wing with Turkish play-maker Arda Turan on the left-wing, which resulted in Turkey winning the match 2-0 and getting their UEFA Euro 2012 qualification back on-track.

5|$|While meditating with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum has {{a premonition}} {{involving}} the Lich, an evil undead sorcerer who was long ago {{trapped in a}} block of amber by the legendary hero Billy. Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream, {{and the three of}} them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum's palace where the block of amber is hidden; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind-control on them. While examining the amber, a snail is placed under the Lich's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are not paying attention. The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom, leaving a wave of destruction <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path</b> (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{embarked}} on his expedition {{to conquer the}} Persian Empire {{in the spring of}} 334BC, having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might. During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, Darius III – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000men. The Battle of the Granicus, fought in May, was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the satrapies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> He continued inland, travelling northeast through Phyrgia before turning southeast toward Cilicia. After passing the Cilician Gates in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in Tarsus. Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000) and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the Amanus Mountains. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the Gulf of Issus from Mallus via Issus, the two armies inadvertently passed one another {{on opposite sides of the}} mountains. This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus. It was not until Alexander had encamped at Myriandrus, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the Pinarus River, just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank. The Battle of Issus ensued.|$|E

Then, he advanced {{himself to be a}} virtuous, well-informed, mature person through the authorized spiritual teacher, called Amir Ahmed Semerkandi, and decided to stay with him to advance <b>in</b> <b>his</b> spiritual <b>path.</b> Due to <b>his</b> perseverance and loyalty <b>in</b> this <b>path,</b> <b>his</b> teacher granted him the khilafetname (the official representation) of the Nurbakhshiyya and Kubrawiyya orders of Islamic mysticism. The death of his father unfortunately played an important role <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, {{and with the help of}} his dream, he decided to leave the family business to his brother, which was in the eastern city of Erzincan in Turkey.|$|R

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the null result of the Michelson–Morley {{experiment}} influenced Einstein is disputed. Alluding to some statements of Einstein, many historians argue that it played no significant role <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to special relativity, while other statements of Einstein probably suggest that he was influenced by it. In any case, the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.|$|E
25|$|Mabaya (Frank Welker) - A rogue bull {{elephant}} {{who originally}} {{belonged to the}} same herd as Jabari and his parents. Mabaya, like all rogues, is almost constantly angry and attacks or tramples anything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> He is easily recognized by his broken right tusk and bloodshot red eyes. Episodes featuring Mabaya usually require Tantor to overcome his fears and face down the renegade in an elephantine match of strength.|$|E
25|$|Another time Saint Anthony was {{travelling}} in the desert, {{he found}} a plate of silver coins <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> He pondered {{for a moment as}} to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him.

Peach and Mario depart from the castle in a hot-air balloon, with Luigi and the Toads following behind.|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E

Under Tughril Beg's successor, Malik Shah (1072–1092), Iran enjoyed a {{cultural}} and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the observatory where Omar Khayyám did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns.
