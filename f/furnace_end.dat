50|$|<b>Furnace</b> <b>End</b> is a hamlet in the North Warwickshire {{district}} {{of the county}} of Warwickshire in England. It {{is located on the}} B4114 road where the road intersects with the B4098 about half way between the market towns of Coleshill and Atherstone. Other nearby places include Nether Whitacre, Over Whitacre (where population details can be found), Whitacre Heath, Shustoke, Kingsbury and Fillongley. The village is believed to have acquired its name because of the iron smelting furnaces located there, which were owned by the Jennens family of nearby Nether Whitacre.|$|E
50|$|The river rises between Ansley Common and Birchley Heath, to {{the south}} west of Atherstone where it is shown as the Bourne brook. It then flows in a south-westerly {{direction}} past Church End to Ansley Mill where it is forded by a minor road. It continues {{in the same direction}} passing between New and Old Arley to join the Didgley brook which drains the area around Fillongley. Downstream of this confluence, the brook becomes the River Bourne; it is crossed by the Tamworth road, and turns in a north westerly direction, to flow past Slowley Hall, and Daw Mill Colliery. The river continues to <b>Furnace</b> <b>End,</b> where it is joined by the Whitacre Brook, and turns to flow in a westerly direction alongside Shustoke reservoir, beyond which it joins the River Tame downstream of the River Blythe confluence.|$|E

5000|$|In 1891, Col. Potts began {{building}} a nearby chateau-like mansion, [...] "Langoma" [...] (1891-95, Theophilus P. Chandler, Jr., architect), which he {{intended as a}} residence {{for himself and his}} son William. However, he died in December 1893 and did not live to see it completed. William, his wife, and mother did move into [...] "Langoma", but ironmaking at the <b>furnace</b> <b>ended</b> in April 1894, not long after Col. Potts' death. It was the last iron furnace operating in Chester County. The furnace and railroad spur were left largely intact, although unused. The slow dilapidation of the furnace produced a remarkable aesthetic effect. Henry Seidel Canby referred in 1935 to [...] "its moldering cupola furnace, like a Persian mosque of the twelfth century, its long walls and sleepy half-drained dam." [...] This slow decay was accelerated after the death of William M. Potts in 1943, when the railroad was taken up and other metal was reclaimed for scrap. Even after this, HABS photographer Ned Goode said of the furnace in 1959 that [...] "its wild setting in an over-grown field is quite striking".|$|R

50|$|The early device would {{consist of}} a large metal tube, preferably copper due to its high thermal conductivity, which would {{be placed in a}} <b>furnace.</b> One <b>end</b> of the tube would be capped and the other loaded with a projectile.

40|$|An {{examination}} {{has been}} made of several new furnace designs and applications for both atomic absorption and emission. Problems with current furnace designs are analyzed and experimental data from three new alternate designs are presented. These alternate furnace designs were developed specifically to increase the thermal energy available to analyte molecules before they diffused from the optical path. A two pronged support furnace was developed in which electric current passed across both ends of an 18 mm long graphite tube. The tube center, where the sample was placed, heated by thermal conduction from the ends. Thus the analyte vapor always encountered walls hotter than the surface it left as it diffused toward the <b>furnace</b> <b>ends.</b> This heating mode resulted in ten-fold improvements in lead recoveries from some chloride salts compared to the CRA- 63 atomizer. The dependence of lead recoveries on interferent/analyte ratios was also established for lead in magnesium chloride solutions. A double-walled furnace was also examined and compared to the twopronged support furnace. The heating of this furnace was spatially uniform during the atomization of lead and cobalt. Despite this, recoveries for lead and cobalt were equal or superior to those obtained with the two-pronged furnace. Recoveries for lead in ZnSO 4, however, were lower in the double-walled design.

30|$|SnO 2 NWs were {{prepared}} by a normal {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) method. Briefly, {{a small amount of}} Sn powder (purity: ≥ 99 %, about 3 g) was placed in an alumina crucible.

50|$|Most {{indirect}} fired rotary systems use an inclined rotating metallic cylinder to {{heat the}} feed material. The heat transfer mechanism is usually conduction through the cylinder wall.

The cylinder for full scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.|$|R
