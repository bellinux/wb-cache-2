5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February.

Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

These fees might be arbitrary and extortionate, and in later dynasties corruption was widespread.|$|E

25|$|Macalester {{was largely}} carried through {{financial}} hardship {{and brought to}} prominence by Dr. James Wallace, father of DeWitt Wallace. Wallace was acting president of the college from 1894 to 1900, president from 1900 to 1906, and professor until just {{before his death in}} 1939. After World War II, the college developed a reputation for internationalism under the presidency of Charles Turck (later the namesake of Turck Hall), who recruited overseas and created a more diverse student body. Macalester's positive reputation grew during the 1960s, when it consistently drew many National Merit Scholars, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in at the country's top ten. During this time the college also benefitted greatly from DeWitt Wallace's success with Reader's Digest. Macalester continued to develop into the 1990s, building its endowment and adding new facilities and equipment.|$|E
25|$|After America gains Peleliu, the Battle of Okinawa {{occurs on}} the Pacific, where Petty Officer Locke, in a PBY Catalina flying boat, takes {{part in a}} raid on three {{merchant}} ships. On {{their way back to}} base, another Catalina, codenamed Hammerhead, is destroyed by Japanese Zeroes, leaving Locke and his crew alone. The US fleet is assaulted, replicating Operation Ten-Go. Locke's PBY, the only PBY near <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to immediate aid, works to rescue as many American sailors as possible by fighting off Japanese PT boats and kamikaze planes. With the PBY almost completely destroyed, more US aircraft arrive and drive off the remaining Zeroes. In the following mission, Miller's squad makes a ground assault on Okinawa, clearing out the Japanese from machine gun bunkers to allow American tanks to progress. With the battle almost won, the Americans storm Shuri Castle amidst mortar shelling and massive banzai charges. Once inside, they encounter Japanese soldiers surrendering. However, when Roebuck and Polonsky go to search them, they reveal concealed grenades under their clothes, at which point Miller is presented with the choice of saving either Roebuck or Polonsky. The remaining American troops arrive to assist the squad and engage the remaining Japanese soldiers in a battle in the castle center. After Miller calls in air strikes on two buildings, the Americans take Shuri Castle, crushing the last bastion of Japanese resistance on Okinawa.|$|E

Ballinderry reached the 2006 Ulster Club final, but lost {{narrowly}} to Crossmaglen Rangers. In 2008 Muldoon and Ballinderry won the Ulster Senior Club Football League. Muldoon won his fifth Derry Championship medal in 2008, this time as captain. An achilles injury forced him to miss the quarter-final tie with Bellaghy and he was only fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on as a substitute in the semi-final clash with Dungiven. However he recovered in time for the final, and his performance, particularly in the second half, proved vital in helping the club defeat Slaughtneil.

He broke a bone in his foot two days before the replay and could not play. His absence proved costly and Cross won the replay.|$|E

500|$|Khan {{starred in}} seven films in 1995, {{the first of}} which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most {{significant}} release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe.

[...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and do a book on sex.

[...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable.

2500|$|In {{creating}} {{the world of}} Rapture, Levine imagined a utopia that its creators {{did not want the}} outside world to discover. Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a [...] "pseudo-objectivism and extremely capitalistic view on the world" [...] as well as a fear of the New Dealers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from Art Deco, describing the style as, [...] "Yes, we are men, and we control the universe!" [...] He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as Howard Hughes and Ayn Rand, though comparing him to John Galt, a character in Rand's Atlas Shrugged, in that he is more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts. Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection. During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated {{that he did not want}} to kill Ryan, asking Levine, [...] "Are still (sic) doomed to make games where we have to use plot devices to clean that up?"

2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa.

She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
