50|$|One easy {{comparison}} between fragmenting HE and shrapnel shells {{would be to}} imagine a shell of each <b>type</b> <b>standing</b> stationary and base-first on the ground; a high-explosive shell would be equally lethal if detonated in this state vs. detonating on impact after being fired, whereas a shrapnel shell would ineffectually fire its contents {{only a few feet}} into the air in a cone-shaped pattern (while the casing itself remained intact). However, the reduced area of effect of shrapnel shells can be exploited, such as in the creeping barrage tactics of World War I, where shrapnel shells were able to be used much closer to friendly infantry than HE shells could be.|$|R

30|$|One {{major reason}} for use of multivariate {{procedures}} for our model is that it <b>keeps</b> <b>Type</b> I error to a minimum (Fan, 1997; Sherry and Henson, 2005; Thompson, 1985, 1991). CCA is used to identify and measure the associations between two sets of variables. CCA is appropriate in the same situations where multiple regressions would be but where there are multiple intercorrelated outcome variables. CCA was chosen as our model because it determines a set of canonical variates, orthogonal linear combinations of the variables within each set that best explains the variability both within and between sets.|$|R

40|$|A simple three {{vibrational}} level {{model of}} an HF CW chemical laser has been constructed. Rate equations, which govern the vibrational and rotational state number densities {{as a function}} of their velocity component along the optical axis of the laser resonator, are solved in the presence of lasing on two P-branch transitions connecting the three levels. A Fabry-Pérot geometrical optics resonator model is used. The presence of hole burning and cascade enhancement is readily observed in the model through examination of the gain {{as a function of}} frequency, as well as the phenomenon of local anomalous dispersion due to resonance absorption by the longitudinal cavity modes. The saturation of the gain and index of refraction is reported as a function of pressure, resonator <b>type</b> (<b>standing</b> or traveling wave), and resonator length...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>standing</b> waves (SW 0 and SWπ) {{can appear}} instead of spiral vortices from a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow for sufficiently small aspect ratios [1, 2]. The bifurcation sequence from basic flow to spiral vortices via SW 0 can include modulated waves, homoclinic bifurcations, and hysteresis {{as a consequence}} of broken translational invariance [3]. Here we show that the same kind of sequence can also occur for the other <b>type</b> of <b>standing</b> wave, i. e., SWπ. Furthermore we show that SWπ can exist also up to much larger inner Reynolds numbers than is has been found for SW 0. Far from onset SWπ can undergo bifurcation sequences that differs qualitatively from those close to onset. These sequences involve a supercritical symmetry breaking as well as a supercritical Hopf bifurcation towards a new type of modulated wave. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePolymorphic {{parametric}} languages, statically typed, à la ML, do {{not need}} to <b>keep</b> <b>types</b> inside their values during runtime to have a safe execution. Nevertheless this type information gives new possibilities for debugging, allows to extend the language to manipulate types as values. It can be stored either in stack or in heap. To manage the additional type information, we propose in this paper to divide the heap in a value space and a mirror space. The first space is used to store values, the second one is used to store type information and garbage collecting. We describe a new Stop & Copy GC algorithm handling the divided heap with low memory cost. We finally give proposals for partially rebuilding types from informations stored in the mirror space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new proof of decidability of higher-order sub-typing in the {{presence}} of bounded quantification. The algorithm is for-mulated as a judgement which operates on beta-eta-normal forms. Tran-sitivity and closure under application are proven directly and syntacti-cally, without the need for a model construction or reasoning on longest beta-reduction sequences. The main technical tool is hereditary substi-tution, i. e., substitution of one normal form into another, resolving all freshly generated redexes on the fly. Hereditary substitutions are used to <b>keep</b> <b>types</b> in normal-form during execution of the subtyping algorithm. Termination of hereditary substitutions can be proven in an elementary way, by a lexicographic induction on the kind of the substituted variable {{and the size of the}} expression substituted into—this is what enables a purely syntactic metatheory...|$|R

30|$|When {{comparing}} longitudinal ED {{measured in}} different wood <b>types</b> (<b>standing</b> tree, log, green lumber, and dry lumber), {{it was observed}} that ED parameter increased throughout wood processing (Table  1) and was therefore lowest in a standing tree and highest in dry lumber. It is important to highlight the differences found between EDlog and EDlumber. These measurements were taken at the same points and in the same direction; however, EDlumber was statistically higher than EDlog (Table  1). This difference {{can be explained by the}} fact that logs contain elements that disperse ultrasound waves, such as water, knots, fiber or pith inclination, and ultrasound waves take longer time to go from one end to the other and therefore; USV has lower values and so ED has lower values too [25]. Whereas in green lumber, some of these wave-dissipating elements disappear and the wave travels faster from one end to another resulting in greater resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To obtain large {{mechanical}} output power, a ring <b>type</b> <b>standing</b> wave ultrasonic motor using cantilever type bending transducer is proposed. There is a cantilever on {{one side}} of the ring, and four PZT ceramics are set on each end surface of the cantilever. The bending mode of ring is excited by the bending vibration of cantilever transducer. Thus, linear simple harmonic motions are achieved at the particles on the teeth. The working principle of proposed motor is analyzed. The ring and transducer are designed with FEM. The bending vibration modals of transducer and ring are degenerated, and the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are analyzed. The analysis results indicate that a standing wave is excited in the ring by the bending vibration of transducer, and the proposed motor has potential good output characteristics. The results of this paper verify the theoretical feasibility and provide instructions for the development of proposed motor...|$|R

40|$|Linear mixed-effects {{models have}} {{increasingly}} replaced mixed-model {{analyses of variance}} for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al. 2013), presumably to <b>keep</b> <b>Type</b> I error down to the nominal alpha {{in the presence of}} random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data...|$|R
