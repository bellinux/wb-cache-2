5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{rolling cutter}} bits usually employ three cones {{to contain the}} cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} milled teeth. The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile <b>down-hole</b> drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals.

30|$|Under static {{conditions}} (before any production/injection or circulation), the reservoir temperature is stabilized at constant temperature which follows the geothermal gradient. In a dynamic process such as production, injection or during drilling mud circulation, the <b>down-hole</b> temperature changes. These changes take place under two processes: convection and conduction. After a stop of production/injection operation, <b>down-hole</b> well temperature is readjusted to stabilize reservoir temperature. This readjustment also happens under the convection/conduction heat transfer processes. Considering both conduction and convection processes simultaneously in calculations would just complicate the computations. After start of shutting in the well, especially {{when using the}} <b>down-hole</b> valve, the flow of fluid sharply diminishes; so, we can ignore the effect of convection process on the temperature re-adjustment. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} the process of returning the <b>down-hole</b> temperature to its static condition follows an unsteady-state heat conduction process.|$|E
30|$|With the {{development}} of <b>down-hole</b> optical fluid analyzer (DFA), more capabilities were added to <b>down-hole</b> fluid analysis.

In multi-well applications, DFA can help in addressing fluid distribution and variation inside the reservoir, and in identification of reservoir compartments. The basic outputs from DFA measurements are weight percentages of CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8, C 5 H 12, and C 6 H 14 +, in addition to live fluid density.|$|E

The classification error will be reduced as the automatic classification of the data set can be realized according to its global distribution modes and data attributes. One key problem {{is to find a}} feature vector set (data attributes) to distinguish different types of <b>down-hole</b> dynamometer cards (distribution modes). All of them with the same fault type can be divided into a class by the automatic clustering algorithm. The above two feature extraction methods are used to extract the curve eigenvectors of the experimental data (<b>down-hole</b> dynamometer cards) to structure the data set (different fault types of <b>down-hole</b> dynamometer cards with different data distribution).

30|$|In this article, our {{aim is to}} {{introduce}} three main research methods in <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling, summarize the effects of relevant factors on the critical buckling loads and post-buckling behavior, and draw a picture for future research in this field. Previous studies built the basic knowledge framework of <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling theory in which three issues are studied in detail: (1) {{the description of the}} transition between different buckling modes and the corresponding critical buckling loads; (2) the buckling behavior including the deflection curve, bending moment, and contact force under different bucking modes; (3) the effects of relevant factors such as wellbore configuration, torque, and boundary conditions. It is indicated that <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling is a complex problem because of the involvement of instability, nonlinearity, multiple factors etc. Future research on <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling should still be conducted from two aspects: (1) a more sophisticated and more accurate description of the critical buckling conditions and post-buckling behavior, such as the quantitative description of the full path for the buckling mode transition in a vertical wellbore and an arbitrary three-dimensional wellbore; (2) the combination of as many factors as possible, such as the buckling behavior of a tubular string with connectors under the action of friction force in a three-dimensional wellbore. To achieve the above objects, the three research methods should be combined to solve the <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling problems and an efficient calculation program to solve the generated nonlinear algebraic equations should be proposed. In addition, the previous studies mainly focused on the mechanism of the <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling but neglected the active control of the tubular string buckling behaviors, which provides an important guidance for improving the extending limit of the tubular string in well engineering. Therefore, the achievement of active control is also a prominent research direction in the <b>down-hole</b> tubular buckling.|$|E

30|$|<b>Down-hole</b> {{tubular string}} {{buckling}} {{is the most}} classic and complex part of tubular string mechanics in well engineering. Studies of <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling not only have theoretical significance in revealing the buckling mechanism but also have prominent practical value in design and control of tubular strings. In this review, the basic principles and applicable scope of three classic research methods (the beam-column model, buckling differential equation, and energy method) are introduced. The critical buckling loads and the post-buckling behavior under different buckling modes in vertical, inclined, horizontal, and curved wellbores from different researchers are presented and compared. The current understanding {{of the effects of}} torque, boundary conditions, friction force, and connectors on <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling is illustrated. Meanwhile, some unsolved problems and controversial conclusions are discussed. Future research should be focused on sophisticated description of buckling behavior and the coupling effect of multiple factors. In addition, active control of <b>down-hole</b> tubular string buckling behavior needs some attention urgently.|$|E
40|$|The sudden {{hydrocarbon}} influx {{from the}} formation into the wellbore poses a serious {{risk to the}} safety of the well. This sudden influx is termed a kick, which, if not controlled, may lead to a blowout. Therefore, early detection of the kick is crucial to minimize the possibility of a blowout occurrence. There is a high probability of delay in kick detection, apart from other issues when using a kick detection system that is exclusively based on surface monitoring. <b>Down-hole</b> monitoring techniques have a potential to detect a kick at its early stage. <b>Down-hole</b> monitoring could be particularly beneficial when the influx occurs {{as a result of a}} lost circulation scenario. In a lost circulation scenario, when the <b>down-hole</b> pressure becomes lower than the formation pore pressure, the formation fluid may starts to enter the wellbore. The lost volume of the drilling fluid is compensated by the formation fluid flowing into the well bore, making it difficult to identify the kick based on pit (mud tank) volume observations at the surface. This experimental study investigates the occurrence of a kick based on relative changes in the mass flow rate, pressure, density, and the conductivity of the fluid in the <b>down-hole.</b> Moreover, the parameters that are most sensitive to formation fluid are identified and a methodology to detect a kick without false alarms is reported. Pressure transmitter, the Coriolis flow and density meter, and the conductivity sensor are employed to observe the deteriorating well conditions in the <b>down-hole.</b> These observations are used to assess the occurrence of a kick and associated blowout risk. Monitoring of multiple <b>down-hole</b> parameters has a potential to improve the accuracy of interpretation related to kick occurrence, reduces the number of false alarms, and provides a broad picture of <b>down-hole</b> conditions. The <b>down-hole</b> monitoring techniques have a potential to reduce the kick detection period. A <b>down-hole</b> assembly of the laboratory scale drilling rig model and kick injection setup were designed, measuring instruments were acquired, a frame was fabricated, and the experimental set-up was assembled and tested. This set-up has the necessary features to evaluate kick events while implementing <b>down-hole</b> monitoring techniques. Various kick events are simulated on the drilling rig model. During the first set of experiments compressed air (which represents the formation fluid) is injected with constant pressure margin. In the second set of experiments the compressed air is injected with another pressure margin. The experiments are repeated with another pump (flow) rate as well. This thesis consists of three main parts. The first part gives the general introduction, motivation, outline of the thesis, and a brief description of influx: its causes, various leading and lagging indicators, and description of the several kick detection systems that are in practice in the industry. The second part describes the design and construction of the laboratory scale <b>down-hole</b> assembly of the drilling rig and kick injection setup, which is used to implement the proposed methodology for early kick detection. The third part discusses the experimental work, describes the methodology for early kick detection, and presents experimental results that show how different influx events affect the mass flow rate, pressure, conductivity, and density of the fluid in the <b>down-hole,</b> and the discussion of the results.
