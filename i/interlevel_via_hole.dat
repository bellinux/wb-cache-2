Mean time to failure (MTF) of the E IK for the tapered via chains is one order of magn i tude shorter than that for the vertical via chains, although the step coverage of the A i-S i=Cu films in the vias is improved by controlling the slope angle of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> for the tapered via.

The MHEMTs were stressed at a drain voltage of 3 V for 36 hrs, {{as well as}} undergoing a thermal storage test at 250 ?C for 48 hrs. The drain current density of the MHEMTs at zero gate bias dropped about 12. 5 % after either the thermal storage test or DC stress. The gate leakage current of the MHET devices with thermal storage was much {{higher than that of}} devices after DC stress. In the latter case, significant gate sinking was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The main degradation mechanism during thermal storage was reaction of the Ohmic contact with the underlying semiconductor. AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were used to detect c-erbB- 2, an important biomarker for breast cancer early detection. The Au gated region of the HEMT was functionalized with thioglycolic acid and then used to immobilize the c-erbB- 2 antibodies. The source-drain current (Ids) showed a clear dependence on the c?erbB- 2 antigen concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 25 ?g/ml, which is less than the c-erbB- 2 antigen concentration present in both healthy people and people with breast cancer. This approach showed the promise of early stage breast cancer screening and pre-clinical disease diagnosis by rapid, noninvasive and portable electronic biological sensors based on AlGaN/GaN HEMT technology. Thioglycolic acid functionalized Au-gated AlGaN/GaN based HEMTs were also used to detect mercury (II) ions. The source-drain current of the HEMT sensors monotonically decreased with the mercury (II) ion concentration from 1. 5 times 10 ? 8 to 4 times 10 ? 8 M. The source-drain current reached equilibrium around 15 ? 20 sec after the concentrated Hg ion solution was added to the gate region of the HEMT sensors. The effectiveness of the thioglycolic acid functionalization was evaluated with a surface contact angle study. The results suggested that portable, fast response, and wireless-based heavy metal ion detectors can be realized with AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based sensors. The Cu filled backside <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> were used to improve the electrical performance and improve heat dissipation of the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The 70 ?m deep through-wafer backside <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> with a diameter of 50 ?m were etched by deep Si reactive ion etching system on the backside of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The pulsed Cu electroplating process was used to fill up the etched vias with Cu. Mechanical polishing was then performed to planarize the Cu layer.

Thus, besides the maximum stress also the size of the stress field and the probability of existing critical defect are important. With respect to the stress concentration of a hole this means that the strength of the wafers with holes is not only governed by the factor of stress concentration, but also the defect distribution and the size as well as the number of holes.

40|$|A device denoted a board saver {{has been}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} reducing wear and tear of a printed-circuit board onto which an antifuse field programmable gate array (FPGA) is to be eventually soldered permanently after a number of design iterations. The need for the board saver or a similar device arises because (1) antifuse-FPGA design iterations are common and (2) repeated soldering and unsoldering of FPGAs on the printed-circuit board to accommodate design iterations can wear out the printed-circuit board. The board saver is basically a solderable/unsolderable FPGA receptacle that is installed temporarily on the printed-circuit board. The board saver is, more specifically, a smaller, square-ring-shaped, printed-circuit board (see figure) that contains half <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> one for each contact pad along its periphery. As initially fabricated, the board saver is a wider ring containing full <b>via</b> <b>holes,</b> but then it is milled along its outer edges, cutting the <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> in half and laterally exposing their interiors. The board saver is positioned in registration with the designated FPGA footprint and each <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> is soldered to the outer portion of the corresponding FPGA contact pad on the first-mentioned printed-circuit board. The via-hole/contact joints can be inspected visually and can be easily unsoldered later. The square hole {{in the middle of the}} board saver is sized to accommodate the FPGA, and the thickness of the board saver is the same as that of the FPGA. Hence, when a non-final FPGA is placed in the square hole, the combination of the non-final FPGA and the board saver occupy no more area and thickness than would a final FPGA soldered directly into its designated position on the first-mentioned circuit board. The contact leads of a non-final FPGA are not bent and are soldered, at the top of the board saver, to the corresponding <b>via</b> <b>holes.</b> A non-final FPGA can readily be unsoldered from the board saver and replaced by another one.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed {{and systematic analysis}} of the mechanisms inducing voiding during high-temperature reliability tests in aluminum <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> in a 130 -nm process for CMOS imagers. Finite-element simulations have been performed to derive the mechanical-stress profile in the examined structures, while a set of physical measurements and microscopy techniques {{have been used to}} analyze the microstructure of the polycrystalline materials that fill the <b>via</b> <b>holes.</b> Experiments have been designed {{on the basis of the}} simulation results, and consisted of some simple changes to the fabrication-technology steps. The failure rate on a few hundreds of samples was checked and compared with reference samples of the production line. The test allowed suggesting variations to a few process parameters that proved to be effective...|$|R
40|$|A neural {{interface}} {{could be}} used to control a limb prosthesis. Such an interface can be created by facilitating axonal regeneration through a sieve electrode and then register nerve signals intended to control the prosthesis. A key question is how to design the electrodes to ensure the best possible regeneration. Our previous studies have indicated that regeneration can be achieved using electrodes with square-shaped, 100 × 100 μm, <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> (holes that axons will regenerate through). Other reports have indicated a suitable range of these holes between 40 and 65 μm. In the present study we used silicon sieve electrodes with <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> of either 30 or 90 μm. The transparency, i. e. the percentage of the total <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> area, of these electrodes was either 20 or 30 %. The electrodes were inserted into a silicone chamber which was used to bridge a gap in a rat sciatic nerve. After 12 weeks of nerve regeneration electrodes with a hole size of 30 μm and a 30 % transparency had the most favourable result as judged by the regained gastrocnemius muscle force and the formation of reactive tissue inside the chamber. The sieve electrode transparency is crucial for ensuring regeneration...|$|R
