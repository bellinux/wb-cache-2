2500|$|Mohammed Mostafa Kamal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> {{journalist}} from Bangladesh {{based in}} the United Kingdom. [...] He has said, [...] "No Muslim country boycotted East Timor or banned its citizens from traveling there after it became independent from mainly Muslim Indonesia. Christian-majority South Sudan became independent from mainly Muslim United Sudan in 2011. As with East Timor, we did not see any Muslim boycotts. [...] However, when Israel became independent in 1948, Muslim countries acted with unrelenting hostility. Why?" [...] Kamal has said that when comparing Israel's actions since 1948 with those of East Timor or South Sudan, [...] "the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Muslim world's attitude toward Israel is totally illogical, unfair and unjust. Israel {{was established in the}} exact same manner as were Australia and America. History will not rewind." [...] Kamal further added that [...] "anti-Israel activities have not brought the Muslim world anything but tension, conflict and economic ruin, keeping them relegated to third-world status." [...] Kamal also said that it was a lie to call Israel colonialist or expanionist, using proof that Israel has ceded territory since its formation for peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and had not committed aggression against these countries since those treaties. [...] Kamal believes that Muslim countries must recognize the state of Israel, and the Muslim world must boycott Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran if they rejected peace.|$|E

Albert Genette <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> reporter on assignment to cover the Sand Island Squadron; he narrates much of the game's story. Captain Marcus Snow ("Swordsman") is a pilot on board the Osean aircraft carrier Kestrel, which is commanded by Captain Nicholas Andersen, a sea-worn veteran commander. Peter N. Beagle ("Pops") is the Wardog squadron's mechanic. Pops is a former Belkan pilot (actual name, Col. Wolfgang Huckebein) who during the previous war had been assigned the task of dropping a nuclear warhead on a Belkan city. He instead went AWOL and defected to Osean forces, at which time Bartlett found him and arranged a cover story protecting him from reprisal by both Osean and Belkan forces. Captain Allen C. Hamilton serves as the Sand Island Base Adjutant Commander, but in truth, he is a co-conspirator with the Belkans who trained under the antagonist [...] "8492nd Squadron." [...] Hamilton answers to base commander Colonel Orson Perrault, a portly and pompous Osean Air Force veteran who is blinded by Hamilton's influence over his decisions. The 48th President of the Osean Federation is Vincent Harling, a calm-natured pragmatist who struggles to restore the peace {{at the beginning of}} the war, but is later captured by the Belkans and kept out of the way as a threat to the Belkans' plans to play off the superpowers against each other.|$|E
