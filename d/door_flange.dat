40|$|Purpose – The paper {{presents}} a benchmarking analysis that investigates the efficiency gap {{in relation to}} spot welding robots in automotive body shops at foreign and domestic companies in North America. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine body shop efficiency improvement opportunities for the domestic companies or the Big Three, therefore reducing the competitive gap and improving business performance. Design/methodology/approach – The following paper is an extension of an earlier dissertation study conducted by EL-Khalil that focused on improving body shop overall efficiency. The Harbour Report was utilized to determine the best in class facilities that must be visited for benchmarking purposes. The data and information presented were obtained from the facilities visited through observations and interviews. The research utilized the corresponding facilities' labs in order to perform measurements and inspect product welding efficiency. The data obtained were a result of a two-year benchmarking study. Findings – The inspection results of spot welds applied on the <b>door</b> <b>flange</b> do not justify the utilization of additional spot welding arm designs and/or robots for the domestic companies. The data presented provide a good opportunity for improving business performance at the body shop Big Three facilities. In order to reduce the current competitive gap, decrease cost, and improve utilization, the Big Three must adopt new strategies (i. e. communization of specific vehicles parts). Research limitations/implications – The benchmarking study was limited to the aperture area. Researchers are encouraged to test the propositions further on different types of vehicles and different areas of the vehicle body. Practical implications – Based on the actual findings, this paper {{presents a}} case that impacts the improvements of the body shop overall performance in relation to reducing the number of spot welding arm and robot designs at the automotive industry in North America. Originality/value – The presented gap analysis on body shop spot welding efficiency for automotive companies in North America was not conducted previously. Therefore, the data can be utilized as a benchmark target to drive improvements at the domestic automotive body shops. PublishedN/...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the cabinet loads of a typical household refrigerator/ freezer. The thennalload on the cabinet during closed door conditions is investigated. The area of greatest focus is the door and wall edge region of the refrigerator where thennal losses are greatest Conduction heat transfer into the refrigerator cabinet is quantified using numerical computer simulations and experimental measurements. The overall cabinet load is detennined, as well as specific loads for various pathways that sum to equal the total. Based on agreement between simulations and experiments, the complete edge loss accounts for approximately 30 % of the overall cabinet load on the fresh food and freezer compartments. In addition to this primary finding, percentages for heat leakage directly through the door gaskets, along the steel casing at the wall and <b>door</b> <b>flanges,</b> along the steel skin in the mullion section, due to the presence of a mullion anti-sweat heater, and due to the presence of an anti-sweat condenser tube are detennined.

40|$|In modern-day {{automobile}} industries {{the predominant}} type of corrosion is crevicecorrosion located on <b>door</b> hem <b>flanges</b> and fasteners. Today these areas areprotected by anti-corrosive agents. The appliance of these anti-corrosive agents is acostly process {{and could be}} excluded if a more corrosion resistant surface coatingwere to be used. In this thesis work new surface coatings are tested in an attempt toreduce the use of anti-corrosion agents in the concealed spaces. The coatings usedwere two types of zinc-magnesium alloys and a thin organic coating. Tests wereperformed in an accelerated corrosion testing-chamber with three different types ofcrevice models. The analytical methods used were mainly image analysis, X-raydiffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that thethin organic coating gives the best corrosion protection according to this testmethod. It was also discovered that the surfaces with pure zinc coating corrodes lesswhen in contact with a dissimilar material. Furthermore it was seen that the testmethod {{does not apply to}} all materials and environments...|$|R
40|$|The Consolidated Incineration Facility, at the Department of Energy`s Savannah River Site, is {{designed}} to treat solid and liquid RCRA hazardous and mixed wastes generated by site operations and clean-up activities. During CIF`s pretrial burn campaigns in 1995, an appreciable amount of water was recovered from the HEPA housings. Questions were immediately raised as {{to the source of}} the water, and the degree of wetness of the filters during operation. There are two primary issues involved: Water could reduce the life expectancy and performance of the HEPA filters, housing, and associated ducting, and wet HEPAs also present radiological concerns for personnel during filter change-out. A similar phenomenon was noted at the Offgas Components Test Facility (OCTF), a 1 / 10 scale pilot of CIF`s air pollution control system. Tests at OCTF indicated the water`s most likely origin to be vapor condensing out from the flue gas stream due to excessive air in-leakage at housing <b>door</b> seals, ducting <b>flanges,</b> and actual holes in the ducting. The rate of accumulation bears no statistical correlation to such process parameters as steam flow, reheater outlet temperature and offgas velocity in the duct. Test results also indicated that the HEPA filter media is moistened by the initial process flow while the facility is being brought on line. However, even when the HEPA filters were manually drenched prior to startup, they became completely dry within four hours of the time steam was introduced to the reheater. Finally, no demonstrable relationship was found between the degree of filter media wetness and filter dP...|$|R
