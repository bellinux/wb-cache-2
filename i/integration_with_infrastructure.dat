40|$|Abstract — Bluetooth-equipped {{wireless}} sensor nodes can {{be quickly}} integrated in small home networks. These networks can be utilized e. g. for surveillance, home monitoring and automation. Accurate time {{is an important factor}} for time-stamping of sensor data, encryption/authentication and it can also to used to implement time synchronous schemes for low power radio communication. We argue that IP-based time synchronization, such as various flavors of the NTP protocol, can be used with Bluetooth networks. This in combination with an activation schedule allows an efficient trade-off between energy consump-tion and communication delay, and provides easy <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> available <b>infrastructure.</b> The proposed approach in this paper is well suited for smaller wireless home networks, typically single-hop networks with access points that are always available.

30|$|The true {{success of}} {{electric}} vehicles {{depends on their}} successful <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> the <b>infrastructure</b> systems that support them. From a transportation perspective, the typical performance of conventional electric cars may {{have a range of}} only 150 km (Skippon and Garwood 2011) but may still require several hours to charge (Pointon 2012). This affects when a vehicle can begin its journey and the route it intends to take. From an electricity perspective, the charging loads can draw large power demands which may exceed transformer ratings, cause undesirable line congestion, or voltage deviations (Al Junaibi et al. 2013; Al Junaibi 2013; Al Junaibi and Farid 2013; Kassakian et al. 2011). These loads may be further exacerbated temporally by similar charging patterns driven by similar work and travel lifestyles or geographically by the relative sparsity of charging infrastructure in high demand areas (Al Junaibi and Farid 2013). In effect, the electric vehicles and their supporting charging infrastructure couple the transportation and electrical systems into a nexus.|$|R

Several trade-offs exist between the different components of such resource-limited sensors (e. g. power consumption, processing power, network communications) that have to be taken into account to reach a workable solution that meets the requirements. The design of such innovative sensors will therefore require a holistic approach, to realize a balanced compromise between sensor capabilities and their <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> network <b>infrastructures.</b> This paper starts by defining the physical peculiarities that characterize unattended autonomous sensors and then discusses issues specific to classified sensors, such as protection from physical compromise against loss of information or tampering.

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{challenges}} for language development include language extension and composition, {{as well as}} the use of diverse notations. A promising approach is projectional editing, a technique to directly manip-ulate the abstract syntax tree of a program, without relying on parsers. Its potential lies in the ability to combine diverse notational styles – such as text, symbols, tables, and graphics – and the support {{for a wide range of}} composition techniques. However, projectional editing is often perceived as problematic for developers. Expressed drawbacks include the unfa-miliar editing experience and challenges in the <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> existing <b>infrastructure.</b> In this paper we investigate the usability of projectional editors. We systematically identify usability issues resulting from the architecture. We use JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) as a case study. The case study discusses the concepts that MPS incorporates to address the identified issues, evaluates effectiveness of these concepts by surveying professional developers, and reports industrial experiences from realizing large-scale systems. Our results show that the benefits of flexible language composition and diverse notations come at the cost of serious usability issues – which, however, can be effectively mitigated with facilities that emulate editing experience of parser-based editors. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{data-driven}} solutions to difficult problems, {{along with the}} dropping costs of storing and processing mas-sive amounts of data, has led to growing interest in large-scale machine learning. This paper presents {{a case study of}} Twitter’s integration of machine learning tools into its existing Hadoop-based, Pig-centric analytics platform. We begin with an overview of this platform, which handles “tra-ditional ” data warehousing and business intelligence tasks for the organization. The core of this work lies in recent Pig extensions to provide predictive analytics capabilities that incorporate machine learning, focused specifically on super-vised classification. In particular, we have identified stochas-tic gradient descent techniques for online learning and en-semble methods as being highly amenable to scaling out to large amounts of data. In our deployed solution, common machine learning tasks such as data sampling, feature gen-eration, training, and testing can be accomplished directly in Pig, via carefully crafted loaders, storage functions, and user-defined functions. This means that machine learning is just another Pig script, which allows seamless <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> existing <b>infrastructure</b> for data management, schedul-ing, and monitoring in a production environment, as well as access to rich libraries of user-defined functions and the materialized output of other scripts...|$|R

40|$|Designing {{sustainable}} {{urban development}} is a multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary challenge that can benefit from next-generation modelling tools to achieve high performance outcomes and integrated assessments. This chapter presents and demonstrates the use of ‘MUtopia’, an information modelling platform for assessing alternative urban development scenarios. The use of the platform is illustrated through the application to a peri-urban development {{in the city of}} Melbourne, Australia. The modelling platform allows simulation of various transition and future scenarios at the precinct level. The platform is capable of extracting data to assist in developing and assessing the performance of different components (land use, individual buildings and infrastructure related to energy and water supply and use, waste management and transport systems) by taking advantage of the platform’s unique scalability. The selected case study is a 31. 5 ha Parcel of land, a typical peri-urban development in Melbourne’s fringe located in West Cranbourne. A key aspect of the development is the design of a sustainable precinct that is affordable, provides a greater level of amenity and incorporates biolink corridors and natural open spaces critical to the preservation of native biodiversity. As a low rise suburban development this project presents a unique opportunity for the application of the MUtopia platform and to demonstrate how the tool can lead to optimum design parameters for achieving sustainable development.

This is due to various factors such as unpredictable costs related to development, deployment and maintenance of WSAN, especially when <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> existing IT <b>infrastructure</b> and legacy systems is needed. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is seen as a promising technique {{to bridge the gap between}} sensor nodes and enterprise applications such as factory monitoring, control and tracking systems where sensor data is used.

In order to overcome this limitation, we propose {{the development of a new}} solution for EV drivers that enables to travel longer distances. This is achieved by integrating some components of the cooperative transport infrastructure, as EV battery charging systems and public transports systems, and by increasing the driving autonomy through energy consumption reduction, achieved by driving efficiency increase. The <b>integration</b> <b>with</b> the charging <b>infrastructure</b> allows planning the journey of the driver, considering the position of charging points, and booking a charging point for a specific time period in order to perform the battery charging. Therefore, the distance that the driver can drive comfortably, without fearing running out of battery, is increased. The integration of the EV with public transports systems allows extending the travel distance beyond the EV drive autonomy, given by the storing capacity of vehicle’s battery.

The product, pyrolysis liquids, can either substitute {{heavy fuel oil}} directly, or be upgraded via e. g. hydroprocessing to diesel and petrol. This study presents a systematic evaluation of production costs and CO 2 mitigation potentials of different fast pyrolysis value chain configurations. The evaluation considers types of localisations, emissions from electricity and hydrogen production, biomass feedstocks, and final products. The resulting production costs {{were found to be}} in the range of 36 – 60 EUR/MWh for crude pyrolysis liquids, and 61 – 90 EUR/MWh upgraded to diesel and petrol. Industrial integration was found to be favoured. The CO 2 mitigation potential for the pyrolysis liquids was in the range of 187 – 282 t-CO 2 /GWh biomass. High variations were found when upgraded to diesel and petrol –best-case scenario resulted in a mitigation of 347 t-CO 2 /GWh biomass, while worst-case scenarios resulted in net CO 2 emissions. Favourable policy support, continued technology development, and/or increased fossil fuel prices are required for the technology to be adapted on an industrial scale.
