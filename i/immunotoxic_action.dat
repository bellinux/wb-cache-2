40|$|The article treats {{issues of}} {{examination}} of safety of combined bacterial medicinal {{product on the}} basis of probiotic strains of bacteria belonging to two genera obtained by submerged mutual cultivation. During conducting experiments, {{it was found that the}} medicinal product causes no changes in blood hematological parameters of experimental animals, does not lead to their death, has no <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>action,</b> histological examination shows no deviations from the norm. In comparison with standard medicinal products, the proposed consortium of the said strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli does not differ by its safety from commercially available medicinal products “Bifidumbacterin” and “Lactobacterin” produced by PrJSC “Biofarma” but provides higher parameters of biological activity. There also was conducted examination of culture fluid activity after removal of proposed bacterial consortium. A high antibacterial activity of the sterile filtrate of culture fluid was found. ...|$|E
40|$|SCID mice engrafted {{with human}} fetal thymus and liver tissue {{fragments}} (SCID-hu mice) are currently {{considered as a}} new tool in human immunotoxicological risk assessment. Testing of various immunotoxicants exerting thymotoxicity via different intrathymic target cell types is necessary for validation of this model. Therefore, SCID-hu mice were exposed to 2 -acetyl- 4 (5) -(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroxybutyl) -imidazole (THI), the immunotoxic component in the food additive, Caramel Colour III, or the organotin compound, di-n-butyltin dichloride (DBTC). Histopathological examination of the human thymus grafts of SCID-hu mice either exposed to THI or to DBTC showed {{a reduction in the}} relative size of the thymus cortex, an effect also described in rodents, These results indicate that the human thymus is a target for the <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>action</b> of both THI and DBTC. In addition, they indicate the promising potential of the SCID-hu mouse model as a tool for human immunotoxicological risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Mass mortalities among {{marine mammal}} populations {{in recent years}} have raised {{questions}} about a possible contributory role of contaminants accumulated through the marine food chain. While viruses were shown to be the primary cause of the outbreaks, an <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>action</b> by organochlorine chemicals in affected animals could not be ruled out. We carried out a 2 1 / 2 -year immunotoxicological experiment in which two groups of 11 harbour seals each were fed herring from either the relatively contaminated Baltic Sea or the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean. Seals in the Baltic Sea group accumulated 3 - 4 times higher levels of Ah-receptor-mediated 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD Toxic Equivalents in blubber than did their Atlantic counterparts following 2 years on the respective diets. Blood was sampled a total of 17 times {{during the course of the}} experiment for immunological evaluation, during which time the natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from seals fed Baltic Sea herring declined to a level approximately 25 % lower than that observed in seals fed Atlantic herring (P < 0. 01). Natural killer (NK) cell activity has not been previously described for a marine mammal species. We characterized the natural cytotoxic activity of harbour seal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and found this to be interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) responsive, sensitive to antibody anti-asialo GM 1, and it was higher against a virus-infected target cell, like NK cells described for other mammals. As NK cells are leukocytes which play an important role in the first line of defence against viruses, the observed impairment of NK cell activity in the seals feeding on the Baltic Sea herring suggests that exposure to contaminants may have an adverse effect on the defence against virus infections in seals inhabiting polluted waters in Europe. This may therefore have affected the severity of the infections, the survival rates and the spread of infections during recent epizootics...|$|E
40|$|This chapter focuses {{mainly on}} the effects of organotin {{compounds}} in various human and animal models and describes the research performed to elucidate the <b>immunotoxic</b> mechanism of <b>action</b> of organotin compounds. Both dibutyltin (DBT) and tributyltins (TBT) organotin compounds can cause atrophy of the rat thymus. Cooke et al. studied the lactational transfer of TBTC and DBT by analysis of the stomach contents of suckling pups. TBT levels were undetectable in all dose groups, and DBT levels were detectable in the highest dose group. Next to mammals, organotin compounds have been reported to affect the immune function of aquatic organisms. Several studies demonstrated that tributyltin oxide (TBTO) induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in thymocytes. Toxicogenomics techniques offer the possibility to assess the effects of potential toxic components on many parameters including thousands of mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, and processes such as imprinting of genes, alternative splicing of mRNAs, and mutagenesis...|$|R
