5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the French cemeteries was complicated by even more heated arguments over how {{the bodies of the}} war dead should be dealt with. During the conflict the French war dead <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> being split between special war cemeteries, local civilian cemeteries and some had been returned to their original villages. Catholic traditionalists in the government called for the bodies to be buried together in special cemeteries along the Western front, while others campaigned for them to be returned to local cemeteries. In 1919, the decision was taken to use special war cemeteries and to ban the repatriation of bodies, but by 1920 this decision had been reversed and 300,000 French bodies were repatriated to their original homes. The French war cemeteries were typically much larger than their IWGC equivalents and used concrete Catholic crosses for all the graves, {{with the exception of the}} Islamic and Chinese war dead.|$|E

25|$|One of the fair's major crowd-attracting and {{financial}} shortcomings was {{the absence of}} a midway. The fair's organizers were opposed, on principle, to the honky-tonk atmosphere engendered by midways, and this was another thing that irked the BIE, which insisted that all officially sanctioned fairs have a midway. What amusements the fair actually <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> being largely dull. The Meadow Lake Amusement Area was not easily accessible, and officials objected to shows being advertised.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Harris was a {{supplier}} of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through serving a bankruptcy notice {{on him and}} <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import pinball machines. In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.|$|E
25|$|Though {{of course}} a very wealthy man, the CPR had taken a {{significant}} toll on Stephen's personal portfolio. James Hill <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> better off than him for having held on to his railroad when Stephen had had to liquidate his share in it to ensure {{the completion of the}} CPR. He also regretted having encouraged his associates to invest in the CPR, knowing that Hill's Manitoba Railway was a better opportunity. He was not bitter towards Hill, in fact quite the opposite, remaining as Hill's staunchest ally throughout the remainder of his career. Stephen remained a director of the CPR until 1893, but thereafter showed only glimpses of interest in the railway. He reduced his holdings and even encouraged others to follow suit. Ironically, the principal source of Stephen's vast wealth stemmed from his investments in Hill's railroads.|$|E
25|$|Among Toledo’s {{initiatives}} {{designed to}} generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort {{of this kind}} was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests {{in the city of}} Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with anger to the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> filling the president’s personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a key provision of a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002. Although he failed to meet these goals, the IMF approved a $154 million disbursement to Peru in December 2002 and allowed the country to raise the fiscal deficit target in its agreement.|$|E

25|$|In September 2007, Steven {{returns and}} begins {{stalking}} Ian, {{pretending to be}} Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father {{had not been a}} happy experience, and he <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> feeling rejected and in the way.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1298, Andronikos was {{in need of}} his cousin's {{military}} {{talent in}} Asia Minor, where the Turks of Menteshe were encroaching once more on Byzantine territory after having been beaten back in 1293–1295 by Alexios Philanthropenos. Philanthropenos <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> rising in revolt, supported by the local populace which still largely cherished the memory of the Laskarids of Nicaea and resented the Palaiologoi; to prevent Tarchaneiotes, an avowed Arsenite, from following the same path as his predecessor, Andronikos first extracted from him a personal oath of loyalty and then appointed him commander in the southern and most endangered sector of the front, along the Maeander River. There Tarchaneiotes achieved swift success, not only in the field, but most importantly in reorganizing the local administration and ending corruption which had allowed the alienation of the pronoia estates, originally intended for the upkeep of the army, from their rightful holders. Tarchaneiotes seems to have engaged in a reassessment and redistribution of these lands, which was so successful that it resulted not only in an increase in the numbers of his army, but also in the equipment of a small squadron of ships.|$|E
25|$|Sam {{returns in}} 1995, after her brothers, on a boys holiday in Spain, catch her {{in bed with}} David Wicks (Michael French), and force her to return. Sam had tried to build herself {{a career as a}} model, but it had not gone to plan and she <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to {{continue}} her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Initially Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't {{take no for an answer}} and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.|$|E

25|$|In {{opposition}} to Ramesses' strength in international affairs, Hattušiliš III was disadvantaged by questions of legitimacy that raised {{doubts about his}} position as king of the Hittites. Although Hattušiliš had defeated his nephew, Urhi-Tesub, for the throne in all regards he continued {{to be seen as}} a usurper of the kingship. Urhi-Tesub's determination to regain the throne from his uncle caused the Hittite empire to enter into a period of instability both at home and abroad. The nephew had been banished after an unsuccessful coup and <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in Egypt. Ramesses II thereby posed a direct threat to Hattušiliš' reign by harboring Urhi-Tesub within Egypt's borders. Hattušiliš realized that only an alliance with Ramesses could prevent the monarch from unleashing his nephew back into contention with him for the throne. By completing a treaty with Egypt, Hattušiliš also hoped that garnering the endorsement as the true king of Hatti by Ramesses would effectively reconcile the disaffected elements in his kingdom that backed Urhi-Tesub as the rightful possessor of the kingship. In the Near Eastern world Ramesses wielded great power amongst the rulers of the day and formal recognition from him would give Hattušiliš credibility on the international scene as well.|$|E

500|$|After 1321, Walter II {{repeatedly}} {{announced his}} intention to campaign in Greece and recover the Duchy of Athens, but financial constraints and his obligations to the King of Naples kept him occupied in Italy. In 1328, he even briefly concluded a truce with the Catalans. Thus {{it was not until}} 1330 that a serious effort got under way. In June 1330, Pope John XXII issued a crusading bull for Walter, and ordered prelates in Italy and Greece to preach for a crusade against the Catalans; shortly after, King Robert of Naples also gave the crusade his support, and allowed his feudatories to join it. The Venetians, on the other hand, renewed their treaty with the Catalans in April 1331. Sailing from Brindisi in August, Walter attacked first the Latin County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, and the Greek Despotate of Epirus, forcing them to recognize the overlordship of King Robert. From there he proceeded to invade the Duchy of Athens through northern Boeotia, but his campaign was a failure as the Catalans avoided battle and withdrew behind the walls of Thebes and Athens. Walter had neither the troops to overwhelm the Catalans nor the money to sustain a prolonged war of sieges and attrition, and found no support among the native Greek population. By summer 1332, {{it was clear that the}} expedition had failed, and Walter returned to Brindisi. He had captured the island of Leucas and Vonitsa for himself and briefly restored Angevin suzerainty over western Greece, but the main objective had eluded him, and he <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with even more crippling debts. The effect of his expedition on Argos and Nauplia is unclear; he may not even have visited the territory during his stay in Greece.|$|E
