The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and <b>double-glazed</b> <b>windows.</b> All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E

Thermally induced {{switching}} temperature, {{spectral transmittance}} {{of a new}} kind of thermotropic material developed by a different mixing proportion of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), Sodium Chloride (NaCl) and pure water was measured. The optimum mixing proportion of samples for application was determined by solar radiation and outdoor temperature measurements. Radiation transmittance was tested on samples of a thermotropic double glazing window, double glazing window and Low-E double glazing window. Results show that thermotropic <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> with the optimum mixing proportion of HPMC, NaCl and pure water of 2 : 10 : 100 by mass reduces radiation transmittance at fully turbid state by up to 72 % and 32 %, respectively, compared to the ordinary <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> and Low-E <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> which do not have adjustable radiation transmittance, and its radiation transmittance changed from transparent state to light scattering state is up to 60 %, indicating a high performance on switching solar radiation and a great potential for energy efficient windows.

2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} <b>double-glazed</b> <b>windows</b> {{transmit}} heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E

Then the mirrors are adjusted until the fringes are almost perfectly straight. Finally we use a white light source and carefully scan through the approximately equal path range until five or six white light fringes are seen to sweep rapidly by...|$|R
40|$|Building {{integrated}} photovoltaic (BIPV) {{systems have}} been proposed to make solar photovoltaic systems more attractive. These systems are not only capable of generating electricity, but can also contribute to minimise energy consumption in buildings by providing natural illumination, space and water heating, ventilation and shading. Despite these advantages, {{one of the issues}} that still prevents the widespread adoption of BIPV systems is their high capital cost. This paper discusses a novel type of non-imaging optical concentrator that can be used to reduce the capital cost of a BIPV system. This new concentrator, known as rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC), has a flat entrance aperture that facilitates integration within a <b>double-glazing</b> <b>window</b> and reduces fabrication costs. The RACPC, which has a geometrical concentration of 3. 66 x, also offers other advantages over conventional solar concentrators: suitability for fenestration, ease of integration with square PV cells, and passive tracking. Several experiments were carried out on a <b>double-glazing</b> solar <b>window</b> incorporating an array of 4 x 3 concentrator-PV cells. The experiments were carried out indoors under standard test conditions. The results show that the RACPC-PV window effectively increases the short-circuit current by a factor of over 3 at normal incidence when compared with a non-concentrated solar window. The solar window also shows an increase in maximum power generation by a factor of nearly 3.
