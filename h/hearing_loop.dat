5000|$|A <b>hearing</b> <b>loop</b> {{consists}} of a physical loop of cable or an array of looped of cables which are placed around a designated area, usually a room or a building. The cable generates a magnetic field throughout the looped space which can {{be picked up by}} a hearing aid, cochlear implant (CI) processors, and specialized hand-held <b>hearing</b> <b>loop</b> receivers for individuals without telecoil compatible hearing aids.|$|E
2500|$|Telecoils or T-coils (from [...] "Telephone Coils") {{are small}} devices {{installed}} in hearing aids or cochlear implants. An Audio induction loop generates an electromagnetic field {{that can be}} detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They {{can be used with}} telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and induction loop systems (also called [...] "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, <b>hearing</b> <b>loops</b> are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and <b>hearing</b> <b>loops</b> are gradually becoming more common. Audio induction <b>loops,</b> telecoils and <b>hearing</b> <b>loops</b> are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.|$|R

40|$|Presented at the Community Integration Projects poster {{sessions}} in the MU School of Medicine Rural Track Clerkship Program. "Hearing loss is {{prevalent in the}} aging population with {{one out of three}} adults age 65 or older being affected by their hearing impairment. 1 Hearing aids work well in small groups at close distances, but they are technically limited in large, crowded spaces such as public forums due to difficulties in deciphering point sources in echogenic atmospheres with multiple sound sources. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loops</b> overcome the limitations of hearing aids by transmitting sound from the PA to telecoils in hearing aids and cochlear implants. Where installed, hearing device users can wirelessly connect and hear the facility audio directly in their ears. Though this technology has been available for decades, awareness is poor. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loops</b> have been installed in two locations in St. Joseph, including the Missouri Theater, but lack of awareness has led to underutilization.

5000|$|An {{increasingly}} common application is for providing hearing aid-compatible [...] "assistive listening" [...] telecoil.
