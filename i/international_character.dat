State Senator Jack Gordon was instrumental in securing funding {{for the development of}} the campus. President Crosby emphasized the university's <b>international</b> <b>character,</b> prompting the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America. President Crosby's resignation in January 1979 triggered the search for a [...] "permanent" [...] president.|$|E

Nevertheless, as Lords Goodman and Harewood {{put it in a}} 1969 report for the Arts Council, [...] "s time went on the operatic centre of British life began to take on an <b>international</b> <b>character.</b> This meant that, while continuing to develop the British artists, it was felt impossible to reach the highest international level by using only British artists or singing only in English". Guest singers from mainland Europe in the 1950s included Maria Callas, Boris Christoff, Victoria de los Ángeles, Tito Gobbi and Birgit Nilsson. Kubelík introduced Janáček's Jenůfa to British audiences, sung in English by a mostly British cast.|$|E

Steinbeck, when asked {{on the day of the}} announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: [...] "Frankly, no." [...] Biographer Jackson Benson notes, [...] "his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver.

2500|$|Israel has {{a policy}} of {{targeted}} killings against those it considers proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of terrorism {{in the very near}} future or to be linked with several acts of terrorism. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its judgment in The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The Government of Israel. The case addressed the issue of whether the state acts illegally in its policy of targeted killings. The court considered that the legal context is a conflict [...] "of an <b>international</b> <b>character</b> (international armed conflict). Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts." [...] The court decided that [...] "members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law" [...] and that [...] "they do not comply with the international laws of war." [...] They concluded that [...] "members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians" [...] but that [...] "the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities." [...] They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated [...] "it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it." [...] The judgment included guidelines for permissible and impermissible actions involving targeted killings and provided the conditions for investigating the criminality of some of the actions.|$|E
