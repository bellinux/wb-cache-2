50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby. Plants include cotton sedge, bog moss (Sphagnum), <b>great</b> hairy <b>willowherb,</b> bog myrtle, water figwort, flag iris, cross-leaved heath, bog rosemary, cranberry and sundew; common alder trees, alder buckthorn, grey sallow and crack willow predominate.|$|R
50|$|In Britain {{the plant}} was {{considered}} a rare species in the 18th century, and one confined to a few locations with damp, gravelly soils. It was misidentified as <b>great</b> hairy <b>willowherb</b> in contemporary floras. The plant's rise from local rarity to widespread weed seems to have occurred {{at the same time}} as the expansion of the railway network and the associated soil disturbance. The plant became locally known as bombweed due to its rapid colonization of bomb craters in the second world war.|$|R
50|$|Other {{areas of}} the fen become drier during periods of dry weather and support a {{different}} range of plant life. Taller vegetation is more common, particularly reed Phragmites australis and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria. Different plants are associated with this vegetation, increasing bodiversity to include species such as hemp agrimony Eupatorium cannabinum, purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria and <b>great</b> hairy <b>willowherb</b> Epilobium hirsutum. Scrub and woodland vegetation has developed throughout the fens with sallow and alder predominant in these areas, although Blo' Norton Fen has some oak and ash woodland.|$|R
50|$|Epilobium hirsutum is a {{flowering}} plant {{belonging to the}} willowherb genus Epilobium in the family Onagraceae. It {{is commonly known as}} the <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> great hairy willowherb or hairy willowherb. Local names include codlins-and-cream, apple-pie and cherry-pie.|$|E
50|$|In the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the cemetery, the Strawberry Vale Brook, culverted {{for most of its}} length, emerges into an open course. Wetland habitats here contain mature white willow, rushes, reedmace, marsh thistle, pendulous sedge, and <b>great</b> <b>willowherb.</b>|$|E
50|$|This linear site on {{the west}} bank of the River Brett {{comprises}} two footpaths and the alder woodland and fen between them. <b>Great</b> <b>willowherb</b> and meadowsweet grow in marshy silted up ditches, and birds include warblers and finches.|$|E
50|$|The village pond in Loose was {{recently}} surveyed and contained {{a mixture of}} the following species: water mint, meadowsweet, common reed mace, water dropwort, bittersweet, yellow iris, branched bur-reed, greater tussock sedge, brooklime, water figwort, water forget-me-not, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> and marsh marigold.|$|E
50|$|Chamaenerion angustifolium, {{commonly}} known in North America as fireweed, {{in some parts}} of Canada as <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> and in Britain as rosebay willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the willowherb family Onagraceae. It is also known by the synonyms Chamerion angustifolium and Epilobium angustifolium.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{unimproved}} damp grassland on {{the bank}} of the River Colne, with plants such as purple loosestrife and amphibious bistort. In drier areas there are <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> creeping thistle and stinging nettles. There are many species of butterflies and spiders, and birds include warblers.|$|E
50|$|Quarries, {{gravel and}} sand pits, roads and railways, field boundaries, walls, waste ground and rubbish tips contain such plant species as common ragwort, {{pineapple}} weed, hairy bindweed, creeping buttercup, common daisy, catsear, coltsfoot, fat hen, nettle, redshank, germander speedwell, ivy-leaved toadflax, rosebay willowherb, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> and wall pennywort.|$|E
50|$|The swamp area of {{the site}} has Lesser Pond-sedge Carex acutiformis as the {{dominant}} plant species, with other species such as Great Reedmace Typha latifolia and <b>Great</b> <b>Willowherb</b> Epilobium hirsutum found in the area. Sallow is found throughout the swamp area with some areas of open reed bed where Common Reed Phragmites australis is found.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{range of}} flowers established. These include sanicle, common dog-violet, ramsons and ferns such as hart's tongue. The more open areas support plants such as common valerian, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> {{meadowsweet}} and Pendulous sedge. The river edges and wetter places support marsh-marigold, water mint, purple-loosestrife and yellow iris. water-crowfoot {{is seen in the}} river.|$|E
50|$|Major {{stands of}} greater spearwort {{are found in}} the central valley with minor occurrences both up- and downstream. Next to the poor running waters near Ulriksdal Palace are {{intermediate}} water-starwort and further upstream two-metre tall <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> is found along the shores as are instances of blue water-speedwell. Some rare plants along the stream include greater pond-sedge, true fox-sedge, and cyperus-like sedge.|$|E
50|$|The reedswamp of {{the lower}} Ley is {{dominated}} by common reed (Phragmites australis), while further upstream the vegetation contains a mixture of other tall fen species including hemlock water-dropwort (Oenanthe crocata), yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus), <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium hirsutum) and reed sweet-grass (Glyceria maxima). There are also dense stands of willow (Salix) in the middle areas of these upper regions.|$|E
50|$|Many {{varieties}} {{of plant and}} tree life {{can be found in}} and around the shores of the lakes and the water channels. Plants such as Angelica, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> amphibious bistort, betony, gipsywort and yellow flag iris are all common to the area. Many water loving willow trees can be seen around the lakes, these are managed to promote new growth and more willow trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the marsh is club-rush which forms dense stands {{together}} with bulrush, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> and common reed. The alder and birch wood on the drier areas has a good ground flora which is dominated by grasses, Remote-sedge and horsetails. The species reported include common spotted-orchid, marsh pennywort, common valerian, skullcap and creeping jenny. Wood horsetail is abundant in a damp area.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} to have been {{originally}} an old farm pond, and by 1908 it was in the garden of a large house, which has since been demolished. When Lewisham Council built the houses in Melrose Close in 1983-84 the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust campaigned to preserve the pond, and it is now managed by the council as an educational nature reserve. The pond is well vegetated both in the pond and on its margins. Plants include yellow iris, <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> and hoary willowherb.|$|E
50|$|Hedgecourt {{is home to}} a {{multitude}} of wildlife.In winter, bitterns {{can be seen in the}} reed beds near the yacht club, and tufted duck and pochard feed on the lake bed.In spring, nightingales have been heard singing in the old English oaks of the reserve. Many other spring migrants are found here too, such as chiffchaff, willow warbler and more rarely, Dartford warbler.In summer, many wild flowers bloom. These can include <b>great</b> <b>willowherb,</b> rosebay willowherb, wild strawberry, bluebell and much more.In autumn, fungi appear. The largest of these is chicken of the woods.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> flourish. There is also common valerian, purple-loosestrife, common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E
50|$|Gypsey springs are {{watercourses}} {{that are}} intermittent and irregular. They are found {{all over the}} Yorkshire Wolds. The Gypsey Race which passes through the Great Wold Valley is {{the best known of}} these watercourses. It is a chalk stream which supports large stands of bur-reed. West of Boynton, Boynton Willow Garth SSSI is an example of fen carr with a mosaic of habitats consisting of fen, scrub, woodland and running water. In the more open areas of the lower valley vegetation includes meadowsweet and <b>great</b> <b>willowherb.</b> Under the woodland canopies wood avens and enchanters nightshade are present.|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
50|$|Willowherbs {{sensu lato}} are {{typically}} very quick to carpet large swathes of ground and may become key or dominant species of local ecosystems. In the United Kingdom, for example, rosebay willowherb (Chamaenerion angustifolium) is widely found on mesotrophic soils dominated by false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), cock's-foot grass (Dactylis glomerata), and red fescue (Festuca rubra), while <b>great</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium hirsutum) {{is found in}} mesotrophic grassland with stinging nettle Urtica dioica). These two willowherb species also dominate open habitat early in ecological succession, to the virtual exclusion of other plant life. Broad-leaved willowherb (Epilobium montanum) is found characteristically, though not abundantly, in the mesotrophic grasslands with meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and sometimes the uncommon Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum). Most willowherbs will not tolerate shade trees and thus are limited to more recently disturbed patches, yielding to other plants over time. Consequently, though the genus contains many pioneer plants, rather few of them are invasive weeds of major importance.|$|E
