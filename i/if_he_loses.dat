5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E

25|$|Bartman Meets Radioactive Man is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game. Throughout {{the four}} levels, Bartman {{is faced with}} enemies he has to defeat. He only has five life points, but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> {{one or more of}} them they can be restored. This is done by collecting radioactive signs. The player is able to collect lightning icons that give Bartman the ability to shoot lightning bolts at enemies. His other weapons are kicking and punching. In addition, Bartman must avoid the deadly traps that are scattered at various places in the levels.|$|E
25|$|Gigi makes a wager {{during a}} card match with Gaston, {{suggesting}} that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses,</b> {{he has to}} take her grandmother and her to the sea with him when he goes on vacation. Gaston agrees, and they all travel to Trouville. While Gaston and Gigi spend countless hours having fun together, Honoré and Madame Alvarez reveal their once-passionate relationship. While other women at the resort are shown holding perfect poise constantly, and giving off an air of boredom and disdain for anything unfamiliar, Gigi is pulling Gaston out of his depressive rut with her carefree, fun attitude.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, Eric Gomez, {{president}} of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that Álvarez had an immediate rematch clause {{in place on}} his contract, whereas Golovkin, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses,</b> won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later also revealed {{in an interview with}} ESPN the fight would take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 pounds with no re-hydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and Álvarez would be able to gain unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On June 5, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight, and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions {{said in a statement that}} Álvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether Álvarez would fight for the WBC title, Álvarez claimed that he would not be. On July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.|$|E

500|$|John Wesley said of him, [...] "I {{was invited}} to breakfast at Bury by Mr Peel, a calico printer who {{a few years ago}} began with £500 and is now {{supposed}} to have gained £20,000.

2500|$|Before the 2008 presidential {{election}}, Trudeau {{sent out}} strips {{to run in}} the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: [...] "'Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's the way I look at it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses,</b> it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I figure I can survive a little egg on my face'." [...] In response, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, [...] "We hope the strip proves to be as predictive as it is consistently lame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Bill!" [...] {{one of my}} seconds said. [...] "He's been fair {{starving}} {{these last}} weeks. And I've got it straight, the landlord chucks him out <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> to-night." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{that is as}} {{it should}} be," [...] said Margaret, smiling faintly, [...] "seeing that Peter is your champion, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses,</b> you are stamped as a serving-girl, and a woman of no character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{what is it}} you suspect?' said Gertrude. 'Do {{you think}} that Mr. Tudor intends to use your daughter's income <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> a portion of his own? I never heard such a thing in my life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, Sir Hanway, I {{think his}} Lordship's {{remarkable}} wrong; for {{when a man}} gets a horse to suit him, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> it, 'tisn't so easy to suit himself again. That's the ground I stand upon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Take another {{message to}} Whit for me," [...] she said, audaciously. [...] "Tell him I adore ball players, {{especially}} pitchers. Tell him I'm {{going to the}} game today to choose the best one. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> the game----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{is exactly}} what I tell myself, Will. Still, you know, a dog with two bones in his mouth will growl <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>loses</b> one of them.

6000|$|The second gentleman growls out an execration. [...] "Curse the fellow!" [...] he says. [...] "He has {{no right}} to be in this club at all.

6000|$|... 'And then,' said Solomon, {{looking from}} face to face, 'then {{we shall have}} one of those stains upon the floor that never come out.

6000|$|... 'Old Markham. He has old-world notions and prejudices, but {{his soul}} {{is in the}} family and estate.

50|$|Daniel Burros {{was born}} to George and Esther Sunshine Burros in Queens, New York City. In high school, he did well in most classes. Burros was not {{athletic}} and had poor eyesight.

6000|$|To {{support those}} who cannot Swim.--If a person cannot swim a stroke, {{he should be}} buoyed up with floats under his arms, and lashed quite securely, to his own satisfaction; then he can be towed across the river with a string. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>lose</b> courage halfway, it cannot be helped: it will do him no harm, and his {{swimming}} friend is in no danger of being grappled with and drowned. For very short distances, a usual way is {{for the man who}} cannot swim to hold his friend by the hips. A very little floating power is enough to buoy a man's head, above still water.
