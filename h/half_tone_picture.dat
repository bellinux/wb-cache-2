40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the conception and realization of a monitoring system for measuring the gradual curve of major flank wear of milling tools on the shop floor level, and for an estimation of tool life travel based on the actual state of flank wear of milling cutters. In order to enable an estimation of tool life travel a direct method for tool wear measurement is selected. High demands on measurement accuracy afford the set-up of an optical sensor system. It is able to operate in the working range of a milling machine and takes images of the rotating tool in order to prevent tool removal for measuring and to minimize machine idle time. Image processing operations improve the raw <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> <b>picture</b> and extract features for the tool wear evaluation. A neural network is used for this task according to the ability of learning and fault tolerance of calculation. A four-layer back-propagation network with a hyperbolic tangent function reaches best performance for flank wear evaluation. Based on the computed flank wear values a dynamic estimation of tool life travel is performed. The calculation of the current, remaining tool life travel allows on the one hand an optimization of actual manufacturing operations {{and on the other hand}} an improvement of future planning operations. The method of estimation of tool life travel is suitable for a quick, modified estimation when manufacturing parameters are changed during operation. It became obvious, that a clear improvement of utilization of milling tools is achieved by an optical tool wear measurement system keeping a high level of safety of the manufacturing process. The approach of tool wear measurement and dynamic estimation of tool life can be considered as a contribution to an entire process monitoring system including tool and workpiece inspection. (orig.)

40|$|Today {{steganography}} {{has attracted}} the attention of many researchers. In this paper, we propose a new steganography method for secure Data communication on <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> <b>pictures.</b> Using the halftone pictures improve the security and capacity. In this method, the complexity of every pixel in picture is computed, then a neibourhood is defined to compute the complexity of every pixel, and then the complexity of every pixel is computed in the neibourhood. Placing data in the monotonous areas of halftone can explain the presence of hidden data. A method has been represented that surveys the position of every pixel neibouring others and prevents including in monotonous areas. If that was a complicated one, steganography bit after stonehalf will be hidden after scrolling the whole, the process of spreading error will be done.

40|$|TheAcharian genusCetraria has {{not been}} scrutinised {{in the same way}} as the genusParmelia in terms of {{circumscription}} of segregate genera. A few generic names have been introduced, but mainly in checklists without any real indication of what these names stand for. After a detailed investigation of characters in the apothecia, conidiomata, anatomical structures, as well as morphology and secondary chemistry, it is clear that several, more or less distinctive, phylogenetic lines exist among taxa which earlier were accommodated inCetraria. Some of these distinctive phylogenetic lines are distinguished by ascus characters: (1) clavate asci with a small axial body, an apical ring structure in the tholus and ellipsoid ascospores; (2) uniseriate asci with a large axial body and globose ascospores; and (3) taxa with broadly clavate asci with a large axial body and ellipsoid ascospores. Sixty-three character states were studied and results from the character analyses were evaluated by cladistic analysis against 43 examined terminal taxa. Seven further taxa were included in one analysis. Results from the cladistic analyses give rather strong support for a new systematic treatment of at least certain groups in the cetrarioid lichens. A formal systematic arrangement is not made here but will be presented elsewhere. The characters investigated are illustrated in 78 <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> <b>pictures</b> and one line drawing.

40|$|In this work, {{we first}} discuss the image halftoning problem. Halftoning is the {{rendition}} of continuous-tone pictures on displays that {{are capable of}} producing only two levels. There are several well-known algorithms for <b>half</b> <b>toning.</b> The dot diffusion method for digital <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> has the advantage of pixel-level parallelism unlike the error diffusion method, which is a popular <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method. The image quality offered by error diffusion is still regarded as superior to most of the other known methods. We show how the image quality obtained using the dot diffusion method can be improved by optimization of the so-called class matrix. By taking the human visual characteristics into account we show that such optimization consistently results in images comparable to error diffusion, without sacrificing the pixel-level parallelism. The dot diffusion algorithm will be discussed and by modifying the algorithm, embedded multiresolution property will be added. Later, we introduce LUT (Look Up Table) based <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> and tree-structured LUT (TLUT) halftoning. We demonstrate how error diffusion characteristics can be achieved with this method. Afterwards, our algorithm will be trained on halftones obtained by Direct Binary Search (DBS) which is an algorithm with high computational complexity. The complexity of TLUT halftoning is higher than that of error diffusion but much lower than that of the DBS algorithm. Thus, halftone image quality between that of error diffusion and DBS will be achieved {{depending on the size of}} tree structure in TLUT algorithm. We also discuss the inverse halftoning problem. Inverse halftoning is the reconstruction of a continuous tone image from its halftoned version. We propose two methods for inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> of dot diffused images. The first one uses Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) and the second one uses wavelets. We then propose a novel and fast method for inverse halftoning called the Look Up Table (LUT) Method. The LUT for inverse halftoning is obtained from the histogram gathered from a few sample halftone images and the corresponding original images. For each pixel, the algorithm looks at the pixel's neighborhood (template) and depending upon the distribution of pixels in the template, it assigns a contone value from a precomputed LUT. The method is extremely fast (no filtering is required) and the image quality achieved is comparable to the best methods known for inverse halftoning. The LUT inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method does not depend on the specific properties of the <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method, and can be applied to any method. An algorithm for template selection for LUT inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> is introduced. We also extend LUT inverse halftoning to color halftones. The next topic is image watermarking and effects of halftoning on watermarked images. Watermarking is the process of embedding a secret signal into a host signal in order to verify ownership or authenticity. We discuss the effects of applying inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> before detection of watermark in <b>half</b> <b>toned</b> images and offer methods to improve watermark detection from halftoned images. Finally, we consider the optimal histogram modification with MSE metric and optimal codebook selection problem. Watermarking with histogram modification is one of the few watermarking methods which is robust to rotation and scaling. We formulate histogram modification problem as finding a transformation such that the error between the input and the output signal is minimized and the output signal has the desired histogram. It turns out that this problem is equivalent to the integer linear programming problem. Then, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal code book where the codewords can come from a finite set. The equivalent problem again turns out to be a linear integer programming problem and the solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal...|$|R

50|$|In short, {{lowering}} any note of {{a diminished}} seventh chord a <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> {{leads to a}} dominant seventh chord (or German sixth enharmonically), the lowered note being {{the root of the}} new chord. Raising any note of a diminished seventh chord a <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> leads to a half-diminished seventh chord, the root of which is a whole step above the raised note. This means that any diminished chord can be modulated to eight different chords by simply lowering or raising any of its notes. If also employing enharmonic respelling of the diminished seventh chord, such as that beginning the modulation in the above examples (allowing for three other possible diminished seventh chords in other keys), it quickly becomes apparent the versatility of this combination technique and the wide range of available options in key modulation.|$|R
