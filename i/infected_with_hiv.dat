5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV,</b> they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV,</b> households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Most people <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> develop {{specific}} antibodies (i.e. seroconvert) within three to twelve {{weeks of the}} initial infection. Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen. Positive results obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as cholera which emerged in 1992 in India. The frequency of AIDS/HIV is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8million (1.6% of the population) tested {{were found to}} be <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's {{population}} has been infected with M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b>|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E

During a routine check, she tested positive for HIV. Monica believed she contracted the virus from Sharkey who continued to deny that he had infected her. Monica ended the relationship in October 1991 due to her suspicions. In July 1992, she learned that another woman also suspected that Sharkey had <b>infected</b> her <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> as well. Later that same year, Monica filed a $52 million lawsuit against the actor for knowingly <b>infecting</b> her <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV protein Nef plays a {{key role}} in {{impairing}} cholesterol metabolism in both HIV infected and bystander cells. The existence of a small cohort of patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> Nef-deficient strain of HIV presented a unique opportunity to test the effect of Nef on lipid metabolism in a clinical setting. Methods: Here we report the results of a study comparing six patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> Nef-deficient strain of <b>HIV</b> (δNefHIV) <b>with</b> six treatment-naïve patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> wild-type <b>HIV</b> (WT HIV). Lipoprotein profile, size and functionality of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles as well as lipidomic and microRNA profiles of patient plasma were analyzed. Results: We found that patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> δNefHIV had lower proportion of subjects with plasma HDL-C levels &lt; 1 mmol/l compared to patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> WT <b>HIV.</b> Furthermore, compared to a reference group of HIV-negative subjects, there was higher abundance of smaller under-lipidated HDL particles in plasma of patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> WT <b>HIV,</b> but not in those <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> δNefHIV. Lipidomic analysis of plasma revealed differences in abundance of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids between patients <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> δNefHIV and WT HIV. MicroRNA profiling revealed that plasma abundance of 24 miRNAs, many of those involved in regulation of lipid metabolism, was differentially regulated by WT HIV and δNefHIV. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> protein Nef playing a significant role in pathogenesis of lipid-related metabolic complications of HIV disease...|$|R

Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV.</b> According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Changes in {{the profile}} of <b>infected</b> {{individuals}} <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> and the chronicity of this condition become necessary a better understanding about the clinical changes caused by the disease. Objective This study characterizes the physical symptoms of <b>infected</b> individuals <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> in a physiotherapy department of a specialized HIV treatment center. Methods A descriptive study with quantitative analysis was performed. All registered users in the physiotherapy department (138 individuals) from 2009 to 2013 were included. Data analysis considered absolute and relative frequencies of the variables of interest. Results Most patients were female (55 %) and the mean age was 35. 0 years (± 16. 8). Most users were usingantiretroviral therapy and had 4 to 10 years (51. 8 %) of the HIV diagnosis. Many patients have comorbidities and the most prevalent was cerebral toxoplasmosis. The most common physical complaints were hemiparesis, pain, alteration in muscle tone and lipodystrophy. Conclusion According the symptomatic profile found, expanding the role of physiotherapists for <b>infected</b> individuals <b>with</b> <b>HIV</b> is necessary, since the physiotherapy has {{a wide range of}} preventive and therapeutic interventions that can increase functionality, independence level and social participation...|$|R
