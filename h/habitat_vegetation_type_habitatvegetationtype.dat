A biannual bird census was conducted at this site during the breeding seasons of 2009 and 2010. Census data combined with the three-dimensional map suggest that local breeding bird abundance, community structure, and spatial distribution patterns are highly influenced by vertical heterogeneity of vegetation surface. For local breeding birds, vertical heterogeneity of canopy surface within stands, connectivity to adjacent forest patches, largest forest patch index, and <b>habitat</b> (<b>vegetation)</b> <b>types</b> proved to be the most influential factors to determine bird community assemblages.

40|$|Six ecologically diverse study sites viz., Khabeki, Khoora, Dape Sharif, Anga, Knotti Garden and Jallar were {{selected}} {{mainly on the}} basis of differences in their environmental attributes especially variations in elevation, slope, aspect, altitude, topography, soil composition, <b>habitat,</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>type</b> and plant community. The available plant species at selected sites were enlisted. The ecological data was recorded during all the four seasons (autumn, winter, spring and summer) using quadrate sampling method. Soil physical and chemical properties of each site had their own impacts on the species association but seasonal effects, which were particularly due to different temperature and rain falls during different seasons of the year, were more pronounced. Most of the herbaceous species were frequent during summer and autumn due to suitable temperature and availability of moisture and nutrients. However during winter sparse vegetation did not show grouping of plants due to severe cold temperature. Availability of different nutrients at different sites and similar ability of some species to absorb these nutrients also had significant effect on association of species. Species sharing similar habitat were mostly associated as moisture loving species were grouped around water springs of Knotti Garden and Dape Sharif. Salt tolerant species were associated at Jaller site. Species which can tolerate both high salinity and pH were associated at Anga and Khoora sites...|$|R

The CVWMA area is located south of Kootenay Lake and north of the Canada – US border, nestled between the Selkirk and Purcell Mountain ranges.

The CVWMA is located within the very dry warm variant of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICHxw) biogeoclimatic subzone, and experiences very hot dry summers and very mild winters with light snowfall of short duration. These climatic conditions combined with an abundance of wetland and riparian habitat make the Creston Valley a critical breeding, staging and wintering area for a broad diversity of wildlife species (Wilson et al., 2004).

However, many of these rules, when applied to ectothermic organisms such as reptiles, are controversial and require further investigation. To explore factors that influence body size in reptiles, we performed a heuristic study to examine body size variation in an Australian lizard, Boulenger’s Skink Morethia boulengeri from agricultural landscapes in southern New South Wales, south-eastern Australia. We collected tissue and morphological data on 337 adult lizards across a broad elevation and climate gradient. We used a model-selection procedure to determine if environmental or ecological variables best explained body size variation. We explored the relationship between morphology and phylogenetic structure before modeling candidate variables from four broad domains: (1) geography (latitude, longitude and elevation), (2) climate (temperature and rainfall), (3) <b>habitat</b> (<b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> number of logs and ground cover attributes), and (4) management (land use and grazing history). Broad phylogenetic structure was evident, but on a scale larger than our study area. Lizards were sexually dimorphic, whereby females had longer snout-vent length than males, providing support for the fecundity selection hypothesis. Body size variation in M. boulengeri was correlated with temperature and rainfall, a pattern consistent with larger individuals occupying cooler and more productive parts of the landscape. Climate change forecasts, which predict warmer temperature and increased aridity, may result in reduced lizard biomass and decoupling of trophic interactions with potentia...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the ecological effects of large herbivores, {{it is important}} to understand foraging behaviour and how this is affected by density. In this experiment, domestic sheep (Ovis aries) were kept at high (80 sheep per km 2) and low (25 sheep per km 2) population density in a landscape-scale experiment during summer in high mountain pastures in Hol, Norway. We predicted an increasing use of less preferred plant species or habitat types with increasing sheep population density. Foraging behaviour was investigated by direct observations of individually marked sheep on different spatial scales, and diet composition was also assessed with microhistological analysis of faecal samples from known individuals. We found that effects of density on foraging behaviour were scale-dependent, and only detected at the finest spatial scale, i. e. in diet choice. Use of the common grass species Deschampsia flexuosa, which provided the bulk forage (10 - 65 % of the diet), remained constant throughout the season at low densities, but increased significantly over time at high densities. Ewes ate a higher proportion of D. flexuosa than lambs. On a coarser spatial scale, neither patch (within <b>vegetation</b> <b>type)</b> nor <b>habitat</b> (<b>vegetation</b> <b>type)</b> selection was affected by density, but habitat selection differed depending on whether the sheep were grazing or resting. Our study thus provides evidence showing that density dependence in foraging behaviour occurs, but only at the finest spatial scale (diet choice). This result suggests a non-linear effect on the D. flexuosa population with an increase in sheep density: not only is an increasing number of sheep eating more, but each sheep also eat a larger proportion of D. flexuosa than at low densities. This thus provides a case showing that the ecological impact of grazers on plant populations may not be linearly related to herbivore density...|$|R

The presence of five distribution patterns for the non-endemic species and species groups is established and the existence of a central core of distribution within New Guinea is outlined. Some aspects of ecological distribution in New Guinea are considered and the wider ecological tolerance of some non-endemic species, compared with endemic species, is suggested. Finally, the means by which the speciation of Grammitis in New Guinea may have been promoted is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Grazing {{by large}} {{ungulates}} has been chosen as a management tool in scrub-dominated dune reserves at the Belgian coast. Due to morphological and physiological differences between cattle and ponies, differences in foraging behaviour and habitat use are expected, and these {{may result in}} a different impact on the spatially heterogeneous and nutrient-limited ecosystem. Grazing behaviour and habitat use of Shetland ponies and Highland cattle, grazing together in a coastal dune area (60 ha) were investigated at various levels of the foraging hierarchy (<b>habitat,</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> sward height and diet). Habitat use overlap was high in all seasons; both cattle and pony spent most of their grazing time in the grass-dominated habitat. However, Shetland ponies concentrated their grazing activity more on the grass-dominated habitat than did cattle. Cattle spent a greater proportion of their grazing activity in woodland and scrub, compared to the ponies. Foraging activity in woodland and scrub is strongly influenced by season. Within the grass-dominated habitat both species preferred foraging in the grasslands and avoided open vegetation and moss dunes. Within the grasslands, cattle grazed less on the short swards than did ponies. Both cattle and ponies predominantly foraged on graminoids, though there are minor differences between both species and among seasons. Browsing of woody plants occurred only by cattle. Where grazing management has been implemented to maintain dune grasslands and to avoid further invasion by scrub, a combination of cattle and ponies appears to be adequate. Ponies are suitable for maintaining grasslands, but they have no impact on invading scrub. Cattle have an impact on scrub development, both by direct consumption of various shrub species and by opening initially closed scrub...|$|R

Lacustrine sand deposits are characteristic, but rocky hills overlain by finer soils and small rock outcrops also occur. Accumulation of peat typifies low-lying areas.;The study area, comprising 90 km(2 ̆ 72), was intensively sampled using a restricted random strategy, vegetation and environmental data being obtained from 431 plots. Multivariate methods were used to summarize and interpret the data: cluster analysis to delineate <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and species groupings, and ordination to summarize trends in vegetational composition, to examine interspecific associations of species, and to summarize relationships between delineated types and species groupings.;Initial analyses led to the recognition of two distinct groupings: wetlands (132 plots) and uplands (299 plots). Within the wetlands, nine distinct <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> were recognized. Ordination results indicated the importance of nutrient status, and factors related to nutrient availability, in determining vegetation composition. Analyses of the upland sites indicated the importance of moisture availability.

Methods: We censused a total of 321 territories in 12 study areas covering the regional variation in elevation and the associated heterogeneity in <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and landscape configurations. Results: The species occupied virtually all <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and landscape configurations below the tree-line. Nests were mostly located on cliffs, but also in tree cavities, buildings, and stick nests of other raptors. Density varied from 12 to 60 territories/ 100 km 2 and mean nearest-neighbour distance from 0. 7 to 1. 8 km, depending on the availability of broadleaved woodland. Compared to availability, nests were nearer to cliffs and had higher richness of <b>habitat</b> edges and <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> which positively affected chick production. Diet composition varied widely according to habitat and was mostly dominated by Edible Dormouse Glis glis, voles and mice. Conclusion: The conservation status of the species was satisfactory.

To esti-mate the oak dispersal distance and the seed shadow generated by the European jay (Garrulus glandarius), we inserted radio-transmitters in 239 acorns, placed them in bird-feeders and then located them by radio-tracking. Using this methodology we located the exact caching site of 94 Quercus ilex and 54 Q. suber acorns and determined the caching <b>habitat</b> characteristics (<b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> distance, spatial distribution). The results show that: (1) there is no diVerences in the dispersal distance distribution between the diVerent acorn species or sizes, (2) dispersal distances range from approximately 3 m up to approximately 550 m (mean = 68. 6 m; median = 49. 2 m), (3) recently abandoned Welds and forest tracks were the sites preferred by jays to cache acorns, whereas Welds and shrublands were avoided and (4) seed shadows showed acorn aggregation zones (i. e. clusters of caches) close to the feeder as well as isolated caches at longer distances.

40|$|Manmade {{changes of}} landscapes {{and the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} through an on-going intensification of agricultural land use demand for the monitoring of natural <b>habitats,</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and their changes. EU Policies like the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) directive or the High Nature Value (HNV) farmland (EU rural policy framework) request the observation and conservation of natural vegetation with a reporting duty on the conservation status of these areas every six and four years. The FFH directive includes natural and semi-natural vegetation identified as Natura 2000 conservation areas and the HNV farmlands are areas in which the major land use is agriculture but also include a high species and habitat diversity or species of European conservation concern. In the context of this major demand of reporting, remote sensing has great advantages as basis for monitoring of <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and <b>habitats,</b> as it is able to provide large-scale up-to-date geo-information for these monitoring and management activities. However, the monitoring of vegetation demands for data acquisitions at specific times during the growing season. SAR-based systems have the great advantage of acquiring data of the Earth surface within these crucial time frames weather and daytime independent. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) has the potential to acquire images with a high spatial resolution of less than 10 m {{and at the same time}} a high temporal resolution of 11 days repetition rate. In addition, textural information and the potential to analyse dielectric characteristics (e. g. moisture) enable the differentiation of various <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> and the deduction of biophysical characteristics. Within the project MSAVE, the applicability of temporally and geometrically high resolution data of optical, SAR and hyperspectral sensors for the monitoring of vegetation is evaluated and new methods for the analysis of multi-seasonal remote sensing data are developed, which are suited for the identification and quantification of habitats. The herein presented work as part of the project centres the evaluation of the differentiability of NATURA 2000 habitats and HNV grassland with TS-X time series data. Thereby, a TS-X time series consisting of 11 dual-pol (VV/VH) acquisitions in 2011 for the test area located in Southern Bavaria as well as reference data collected during several field surveys within the SAR data collection period are used for the classification of different grassland types, which include the FFH habitat types 6410 (Molinia meadows), 7120 (Degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration), 7140 (Transition mires and quaking bogs) and 7230 (Alkaline fens), as well as HNV grassland. Up-to-now, the TS-X time series has been pre-processed including multi-temporal filtering and the Kennaugh decomposition developed by Schmitt, A. (2012) has been applied to the data. Furthermore, texture features were derived. After a separability analysis for defining the best suitable features for discriminating the different grassland types, the classification is performed with the Maximum-Entropy algorithm. First results show that the high temporal and geometric resolution time series of TS-X allows for a detailed analysis on the usability of polarimetric SAR data for the classification of different <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> The distribution of FFH habitats and HNV grassland can be modelled by means of Kennaugh elements of cross-polar TS-X time series data.

Throughout the twentieth century the plant has {{declined}} in this country, and nowadays it is virtually restricted to the dune-areas of the islands of Texel and Voorne, its presence in other regions appearing either sinking or unstable. Its stations on Texel are described in some detail. The main <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> in which the species is found are reported in table 1. The Texel situation is compared with data on the (former) occurrence elsewhere in the Netherlands, {{as well as in}} adjacent countries. It turns out that – at least in the past – the plant was recorded in a surprisingly wide variety of habitats. These comprise young wet dune-slacks, borders of moorland and dune pools, fishponds, ditches and wet hay-fields in older dune-slacks, polders and brook valleys. In these habitats the plant could be found in <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> belonging to the phytosociological alliances Hydrocotylo-Baldellion, Nanocyperion flavescentis, Caricion davallianae and Junco-Molinion, as well as some undefined <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> of the order Molinietalia. So, although A. tenella has always been a rare plant at the northeastern fringe of its area, it did not show a striking selectivity as to its <b>habitat</b> or <b>vegetation</b> <b>type.</b> Therefore its rarity in the Netherlands is not very easy to explain, its frost sensitivity accounting only for the rough course of its eastern limit. The decline of the plant in this country is mainly due to drainage and eutrophication. However, ceasing of human activities like cutting sods or mowing has also contributed to its disappearance from many sites in the dunes and in moorland areas. Nearly all present sites are situated in nature reserves, where the plant is protected against drainage and eutrophication influences. Nevertheless, the management of these reserves is of vital importance for the populations of A. tenella, some kind of human interference being required for their survival in most cases...|$|R

30|$|The same {{analysis}} {{was done for}} a less abundant <b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> redwood forest (Figure 6 c). Redwoods are found in areas of CWD with a slightly smaller range, 640 to 800 mm/yr. A close-up look at the future distribution of CWD indicates a large decline of area suitable for redwoods, with these areas on north-facing slopes and in the bottoms of valleys. Although suitable habitat declines and becomes less connected than the current distribution of mapped redwoods, there is ample suitable habitat in surrounding cells to provide nearby locations for preservation of the species. The final example is the blue oak forest/woodland (Figure 6 d), which is located in areas with CWD of 710 to 900 mm/yr. This range of conditions declines only slightly over the next century, generally moving to areas of deeper soils. As the blue oak is currently {{at the edge of}} its range in the North Bay and probably already occupying selected areas of refuge, the suitable habitat of the mapped populations of blue oak does not decline significantly {{by the end of the}} next century, potentially providing an increase in the preferred <b>habitats</b> for this <b>vegetation</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 Spawning {{habitats}} of Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska {{were analyzed}} {{to determine the}} importance of <b>habitat</b> features including <b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> percent vegetative cover, substrate type, water depth, and shoreline slope {{in the importance of}} herring spawning ground selection. Sidescan sonar data were used to compare bottom habitat characteristics of herring spawning areas vs. non-spawn areas. No significant differences in <b>vegetation</b> or substrate <b>type</b> were detected between areas where herring do and do not spawn. Generalized linear models and analysis of variance models were constructed to predict the probability of herring spawn and estimate egg densities given habitat information collected by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game during herring egg deposition surveys. Habitat characteristics explained 31 % of the deviance in spawn presence and absence and 28 % of the variability in egg densities. <b>Vegetation</b> <b>type</b> was the most important variable in determining the presence of spawn and vegetative percent cover was the most important variable in determining the intensity of herring spawn. Herring spawned most often on brown and red filamentous algae and red foliose algae. Egg densities increased with increasing percent vegetative cover. Spawning occurred most frequently in the shallow subtidal zone from 0 - 4 m...|$|R
40|$|The genus Hygrocybe (Fr.) P. Kumm. is {{globally}} distributed. Certain taxa {{occur on}} different continents, {{even in the}} northern and the southern hemisphere. In Europe grassland is the preferred habitat. The trophic ecology is still unclear. In this review studies and internet sources of about 65 locations distributed from high to low latitudes across all continents in which 16 Hygrocybe species (typically found in Europe) occur have been analysed with regard to <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>vegetation</b> and soil properties. The analysis shows {{that several of the}} selected Hygrocybe species can cope with a very wide range of habitats. They appear to prefer soils with low fertility, grassland over forests and temperate/boreal climates. Most significantly, waxcaps are found in forest habitats in the absence of grasses, and in grasslands where woody hosts are absent. Mosses are not obligately associated. Their host associations are extremely flexible. A biotrophic lifestyle should be considered. The genus Hygrocybe (Fr.) P. Kumm. is globally distributed.

40|$|Urticaceae is {{a family}} with more than 2000 species, which {{contains}} remarkable morphological diversity. It has undergone many taxonomic reorganizations, and is currently the subject of further systematic studies. To gain more resolution in systematic studies and {{to better understand the}} general patterns of character evolution in Urticaceae, based on our previous phylogeny including 169 accessions comprising 122 species across 47 Urticaceae genera, we examined 19 diagnostic characters, and analysed these employing both maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood approaches. Our results revealed that 16 characters exhibited multiple state changes within the family, with ten exhibiting >eight changes and three exhibiting between 28 and 40. Morphological synapomorphies were identified for many clades, but the diagnostic value of these was often limited due to reversals within the clade and/or homoplasies elsewhere. Recognition of the four clades comprising the family at subfamily level can be supported by a small number carefully chosen defining traits for each. Several non-monophyletic genera appear to be defined only by characters that are plesiomorphic within their clades, and more detailed work would be valuable to find defining traits for monophyletic clades within these. Some character evolution may be attributed to adaptive evolution in Urticaceae due to shifts in <b>habitat</b> or <b>vegetation</b> <b>type.</b> This study demonstrated the value of using phylogeny to trace character evolution, and determine the relative importance of morphological traits for classification...|$|R
40|$|Feral swine (Sus scrofa), a {{successful}} invasive {{species in the}} United States, have established growing populations in 38 states and are a reservoir of diseases important to domestic swine. An understanding of habitat use and movements {{is important for the}} prevention of disease transmission between feral and domestic swine. To assess risk posed to neighboring domestic swine facilities in East and South Texas, we determined habitat use and movement patterns of feral swine within 10 miles of domestic swine facilities, identified similarities in <b>habitat</b> preferences and <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> directly surrounding facilities, assessed effects of wet and dry conditions on general habitat use, and determined whether landscape features such as corridors or boundaries influenced movements across utilized habitats. Kernel area values (95 % isopleths) for wet and dry periods were different (F 2, 16 = 6. 38, P = 0. 005) between East and South Texas. Feral swine preferred habitat characteristics commonly found surrounding domestic swine facilities. Feral swine also demonstrated disproportionate use of specific <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> as compared to availability during both wet and dry periods. Additionally, the presence of paved, 2 -lane roads influenced movements of feral swine. The new knowledge of habitat use and landscape movements we present can be used for more efficient application of targeted management and eradication strategies near domestic swine facilities, particularly in emergency situations such as disease outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{occurrence}} of montane and boreomontane species in ravines of the sandstone landscape are scarce and {{the occurrence}} of these species are explained {{by the presence of}} temperature inversion. The question is, which factors limit {{the occurrence of}}these species in ravines with temperature inversion. The aim of this diploma thesis is to reveal factors that influence the occurrence of Huperzia selago in inverse ravines of sandstone landscape. This work uses a habitat variables recorded directly for populations of H. selago and variables derived from a digital elevation model. These derived variables are also used for creation of two predictive models of geographic distribution of H. selago in the National Park Bohemian Switzerland. When we summarize the most informative variables of predictive models and habitat conditions significantly different from control sites, we get the typical habitat of H. selago. Such sites will likely be found on the rock {{at the bottom of the}} valley. Factors that influence the suitability of <b>habitat</b> are: moisture, <b>vegetation</b> <b>type,</b> slope, and distance to the bottom of the valley...|$|R
40|$|Many factors {{affect the}} {{productivity}} of songbirds. Which <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> the birds inhabit, nest-site characteristics, and adult behavior at the nest may affect predation and parasitism frequencies, fecundity, and nest survival and fledgling survival. All of these metrics determine reproductive success of individuals and may influence population persistence, especially for threatened and endangered species. My research investigated factors that affected these metrics for endangered black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla). Shrubland is considered high quality vireo <b>habitat,</b> with woodland <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> considered marginal. I located and monitored nests, conducted nest behavior observations, recorded behavior and predation at nests using video cameras, and resighted fledglings in shrubland, oak-juniper woodland, and deciduous woodland during the 2008 ? 2010 breeding seasons. I monitored 302 black-capped vireo nests in 259 territories and resighted 350 fledglings with unique color combinations. Apparent nest success, nest survival, success of first nest attempts, parasitism and predation frequency, and fecundity did not differ statistically among <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> Parasitism frequency was nearly twice as high in shrubland (22 percent) than in either woodland (12 percent in each) and varied by year. Nest-site characteristics differed among <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> but nest survival was affected only by nest height and year; nests placed higher {{from the ground and}} nest attempts in 2008 and 2009 had lower survival. Fledgling survival was not affected by <b>vegetation</b> <b>type</b> or proximity of the nest to oak-juniper woodland. Nest behavior was not affected by vegetation characteristics, though nest attentiveness during incubation increased as average cover from 0 to 2 m increased. Females spent 80 percent more time on nests during incubation and 250 percent more time on nests during the nestling stage than males, but visitation was similar for each sex. Overall, the probability of nest success improved as male participation increased. My results emphasize the importance of male participation in determining the outcome of nests for species exhibiting bi-parental care. Furthermore, woodland habitats previously considered marginal may be good quality habitat in areas with large populations of black-capped vireos. Recognizing woodlands as non-typical, yet still suitable, habitat will allow managers to incorporate these <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> into management plans and recommendations for landowner conservation incentive programs...|$|R
