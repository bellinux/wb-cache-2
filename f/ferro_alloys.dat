40|$|YesThe {{effects of}} 0 · 5 wt-%Mo {{addition}} on the processing, microstructure, {{and strength of}} PM Fe¿ 3 · 5 Mn¿ 0 · 7 C steel are described. Water atomised and sponge irons, Astaloy 1 · 5 Mo, milled ferromanganese, and graphite were the starting powders. During sintering in 75 H 2 / 25 N 2 or pure hydrogen the dewpoint was controlled and monitored; in particular the effects of improving it from - 35 to - 60 °C were investigated. Faster heating rates (20 K min- 1), sufficient gas flowrates, milling the <b>ferro</b> <b>alloy</b> under nitrogen, a low dewpoint (<- 60 °C), and a getter powder can all contribute to the reduction or prevention of oxidation of the manganese, in particular formation of oxide networks in the sintered steels. For 600 MPa compaction pressure densities up to 7 · 1 g cm- 3 were obtained; these were not significantly affected by sintering at temperatures up to 1180 °C. The sintered microstructures were sensitively dependent on the cooling rate. Irrespective {{of the presence of}} Mo, slow furnace cooling at 4 K min- 1 resulted in mainly pearlitic structures with some ferrite and coarse bainite, whereas fast cooling at 40 K min- 1 produced martensite and some retained austenite, very fine pearlite, bainite, and some ferrite. Young's modulus, determined by tensile and ultrasonic tests, was in the range 110 ¿ 155 GPa. Sintering with - 60 °C dewpoint resulted in tensile and transverse rupture strengths of 420 and 860 MPa for the Mn steel, rising to 530 and 1130 MPa {{as a result of the}} Mo addition. This contrasts with strength decreases observed when processing included use of high oxygen containing ferromanganese and sintering with - 35 °C dewpoint...|$|R

40|$|South Africa is {{blessed with}} a plethora of mineral resources, and as such several mineral {{beneficiation}} plants are in operation. In the mining value chain, a processing facility {{is seen as the}} bottleneck. The reason for this is quite simple. Large quantities of ore are removed in a highly industrialised process from mining activities. This large amount of ore needs to be beneficiated through capacity constrained processing facilities. In order to maintain an economically viable balance between life of mine, and maximum throughput, a large portion of ore extracted from South Africa is exported to foreign countries. The ore is then further beneficiated in plants that do not necessarily suffer from the same constraints as the South African plants. These constraints include labour costs, electricity availability and pricing, water usage etc. Even though the downstream beneficiation of minerals will {{have a profound effect on}} the South African economy, it is of utmost importance that the Mineral Beneficiation Plants (MBP’s) responsible for a large portion of the beneficiation strategy, be operated effectively to allow local end users of their products to remain internationally competitive. It is clear that MBP’s play an integral part in the value chain of the minerals industry, and effective operation of these plants are critical. It is of utmost importance to ensure that MBP’s are operating at full capacity, as effectively as possible, and within budget constraints. Development of a continuous improvement model for a South African Minerals Beneficiation Plant In order to achieve this objective, MBP’s need to implement a sustainable Continuous Improvement Programme. Several models are available and have been utilised with variable success rates in some MBP’s around the world, however none of these models specifically address CI from a minerals processing point of view. This study aims to develop a model which can be exclusively used for CI in South African MBP’s. A survey was conducted to understand the requirements that a CI model should fulfil. The survey was completed by respondents in both junior and senior roles within different resourcing and consulting organisations as well as academic institutions. It was found that most respondents prefer a model which involves an amalgamation of current CI models i. e. six sigma, theory of constraints and lean manufacturing. A new model was developed using the elements from these existing models that are applicable to MBP’s. The model also incorporates strategic direction required to implement it successfully. It focusses on the core elements that would result in process improvement. These are as follows: • Reduction in Waste • Improvement in Quality • Improvement in Efficiency • Decrease in cost A case study is shown which highlights the applicability and success of the model within a South African <b>Ferro</b> <b>Alloy</b> plant.

40|$|AbstractThe cement {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} challenges that include depleting fossil fuel reserves, scarcity of raw materials, perpetually increasing demand for cements and concretes, growing environmental concerns linked to climate change and an ailing world economy. Every tonne of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) that is produced releases on average a similar amount of CO 2 into the atmosphere, or in total roughly 6 % of all man-made carbon emissions. Improved production methods and formulations that reduce or eliminate CO 2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process are thus high on the agenda. Emission reduction is also needed to counter the impacts on product cost of new regulations, green taxes and escalating fuel prices. In this regard, locally available minerals, recycled materials and (industry, agriculture and domestic) waste may be suitable for blending with OPC as substitute, {{or in some cases}} replacement, binders. Fly ash, Blast furnace slag and silica fumes are three well known examples of cement replacement materials that are in use today that, like OPC, have been documented and validated both in laboratory tests and in practice. The first is a by-product of coal combustion, the second of iron smelting and the third of electric arc furnace production of elemental silicon or <b>ferro</b> silicon <b>alloys.</b> This paper presents a concise review of the current state-of-the-art and standards underpinning the production and use of OPC-based cements and concretes. It outlines some of the emerging green alternatives and the benefits they offer. Many of these alternatives rely on technological advances that include energy-efficient, low carbon production methods, novel cement formulations, geopolymers, carbon negative cements and novel concrete products. Finally, the economics of cement production and the trends in the UK, US and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Region are presented, to help guide and inform future developments in cement production based on maximizing the value of carbon reduction...|$|R
