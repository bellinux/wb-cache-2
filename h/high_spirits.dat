5|$|When tickets went on sale, {{the concerts}} did not sell out {{instantly}} but {{sold at a}} healthy pace. On the opening night, she sang at the Miami Arena. Approximately two-thirds of the venue's capacity was filled, which worried Carey's management. However, Carey {{did not seem to}} mind and began the show with <b>high</b> <b>spirits.</b> The first show in Miami received scathing reviews; subsequent shows sold out of tickets and attracted rave reviews.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley {{to begin his}} second {{invasion}} of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in <b>high</b> <b>spirits,</b> Lee intended to shift {{the focus of the}} summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.|$|E
5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his <b>high</b> <b>spirits</b> and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E

'From {{the notion}} of ghosts,' says Mr. Im Thurn, 'a belief has arisen, but very gradually, in <b>higher</b> <b>spirits,</b> and {{eventually}} in a <b>Highest</b> <b>Spirit,</b> and, keeping pace {{with the growth of}} these beliefs, a habit of reverence for, and worship of spirits....

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} funerals, he {{travelled}} to Amsterdam with Mugford and a friend, where {{he bought a}} large quantity of cannabis; the travel agent who sold the tickets said the group had been in <b>high</b> <b>spirits.</b> Bamber also began selling his family's belongings; Mugford's mother was offered June's car and an ad {{was placed in a}} local newspaper asking ₤900 for Nevill's. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Bamber tried to sell 20 nude photographs of Sheila for ₤20,000 to The Sun, and went on another overseas trip with a friend, Brent, this time to Saint-Tropez.|$|E
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C-5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent <b>high</b> <b>spirits,</b> New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in <b>high</b> <b>spirits,</b> confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E

5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he {{expected}} to be fired {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in <b>high</b> <b>spirits.</b> Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. In the locker room after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff contention and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{spent the}} {{beginning}} of his teenage years in England between the courts of The Hague and his uncle King Charles I, before being captured and imprisoned in Linz during the middle stages of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert had become a soldier early; at the age of 14 he attended the Dutch pas d'armes with the Protestant Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. Later that year he fought alongside him and the Duke of Brunswick at the Anglo-German siege of Rheinberg, and by 1635 he was acting as a military lifeguard to Prince Frederick. Rupert went on to fight against imperial Spain in the successful campaign around Breda in 1637 during the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands. By the end of this period, Rupert had acquired a reputation for fearlessness in battle, <b>high</b> <b>spirits</b> and considerable industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and <b>high</b> <b>spirits,</b> like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began the}} {{following}} April, with Kurosawa in <b>high</b> <b>spirits.</b> Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, {{not the least}} of which was the firing of the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu—creator of the very popular Zatoichi character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.|$|E

25|$|The 2003–04 season had a {{positive}} start; a new logo, a new strip, a renewed sponsorship contract with Thwaites Brewery, and a clutch of upcoming young players left Haig and new team captain Neil Haworth in <b>high</b> <b>spirits</b> before the first game. The team's preparations paid off; the first weekend of the season consisted of a 13-2 win over the Bradford Bulldogs, and another 20-3 victory against the Grimsby Buffaloes.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization's {{classification}} system defines a manic episode as one where mood {{is higher than}} the person's situation warrants and may vary from relaxed <b>high</b> <b>spirits</b> to barely controllable exuberance, accompanied by hyperactivity, a compulsion to speak, a reduced sleep requirement, difficulty sustaining attention and often increased distractibility. Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. Behavior that is out of character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint.|$|E
25|$|In those days, {{pursued by}} the bounty-hunters, as the {{governor}} of Lahore had {{put a price on}} a Sikh's head, the Sikhs roamed the jungles of Central Punjab in small groups. Kapur Singh headed one such band. To assert their <b>high</b> <b>spirits</b> despite being hounded by government forces and bounty-hunters, and with a view to paralysing the administration and obtaining food for their companions these groups would launch attacks on government treasuries and caravans moving from one place to another. Such was their success in this endeavour that the governor was soon obliged to make terms with them.|$|E
25|$|Harriott's free-form {{compositions}} normally formed only {{a portion}} of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's <b>High</b> <b>Spirits</b> (Columbia), was a straight-ahead jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the Noël Coward play Blithe Spirit. However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to free form, and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable in the changing musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects.|$|E
