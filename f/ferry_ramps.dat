25|$|The two Severn {{crossings}} {{are regarded}} as the main crossing points from England into South Wales. Prior to 1966 road traffic between the southern counties of Wales and the southern counties of England either had to travel via Gloucester or take the Aust Ferry, which ran roughly {{along the line of}} the Severn Bridge, from Old Passage near Aust to Beachley. The <b>ferry</b> <b>ramps</b> at Old Passage and Beachley are still visible.|$|E

The rail bridge is downriver from the former <b>ferry</b> <b>ramps</b> between the towns and both {{the old and new}} U.S. Route 40 bridges. Coke ovens lined the east bank trackage and the bridge off map to the north allowed entire trains to pull through and turn around for the run back to Fayette and Greene County, Pennsylvanian and West Virginian mines, keeping throughput up, and reducing the time dumping tracks were blocked by empty train consists of hopper cars.|$|E
40|$|In Port Aransas, TX, movable bridges, <b>ferry</b> <b>ramps,</b> {{are used}} to dock ferry boats and load {{vehicles}} on and off of the boats to cross the Corpus Christie, TX ship channel as part of State Highway 361. Fatigue cracks are present {{in several of the}} bearing assemblies that attach the ramps to the headwall at the ferry landing. The cracks were caused by axial forces in the main supporting beams of the ramps. Using strain gage instrumentation applied to the beams, estimates of the axial forces were obtained. A video camera was installed to allow the research team to distinguish between loading events caused by large or small ferry boats. The recorded data from the instrumentation was accessed remotely from Texas A&M University in College Station and analyzed using MatLAB, Mathematica, and Microsoft Excel. Load data was collected for several months. The information was used to develop recommendations for design loads to be used when the bearing assemblies are rebuilt. Results indicate that the exterior beams of the ramps experience the largest force values in compression caused by docking and thrusting of the ferry boats. The interior beams experience majority of the tension forces caused by vehicles crossing the ramps. To date, the largest force detected is 102. 56 kips in compression...|$|E

40|$|Omokoroa Peninsula, {{located on}} the shores of Tauranga Harbour, has {{undergone}} major land use changes with associated shoreline modifications; becoming increasingly urbanised since the 1950 s. A low-lying area on the northeastern side of the peninsula, referred to loosely as the Omokoroa Domain, is important to the community for recreational use and as a location for a vehicular ferry service to Matakana Island. Sedimentation issues {{in the vicinity of the}} boat ramp have created problems regarding access to the boat ramp, as well as requiring protection works to deal with shoreline erosion. The primary aim of this research was to determine the geomorphic evolution of the Omokoroa Domain and assess the processes that contribute to the long-term stability and future evolution of the shoreline. A range of different techniques were used to assess the prehistoric and historic geomorphic changes and interpret the driving processes; and also to quantify modern processes operating around the Omokoroa Peninsula. These have included analysis of historic photos, particularly aerial photographs; examination of LIDAR and mapped information, such as the underlying geology; field observations of the stratigraphic units in the cliffs and shore platforms around the peninsula; collection of sediment samples from potential sources, transport pathways and sinks, and associations lab analyses to characterise the sediments; shallow coring to determine the near surface stratigraphy of coastal sediments; and the deployment of a range of instruments, and subsequent analysis of the collected data to define the hydrodynamic processes around the Omokoroa Peninsula. The various lines of evidence analysed indicate the Omokoroa Domain can be classified as a cuspate spit, which enclosed a tidal lagoon that was infilled with landfill during the construction of roads on the Peninsula. The spit has developed in an area of low sedimentation, with a low potential for sediment transport. The sediment comprising the shoreline around the Omokoroa Domain is primarily derived from local sources, specifically from mass-wasting from the peninsula and predominantly from debris from landslides in the immediate vicinity of the Domain. There is evidence of both a tsunami event and rapid deposition of most of the sediment after 1, 652 ± 20 BP. This appears to be associated with a local earthquake that also produced a tsunami deposit at Waihi Beach. It is possible that ground shaking and vertical movement triggered landslide events around Omokoroa Peninsula. Continuous tidal action and episodic wind generated waves are the primary factors influencing sediment transport, redistributing sediment around the Peninsula, and forming the cuspate spit and tidal lagoon. More recently, landslides have mostly formed on the western side of the Omokoroa Peninsula, with the sandy debris being transported around the peninsula to accumulate on the northern flank of the modified cuspate spit. This sediment is a minor contribution to the sedimentation problems at the boat ramp; the major issue being settling of fine sediment within the turbid fringe that has been enhanced by the shape of the present boat and vehicular <b>ferry</b> <b>ramps,</b> and associated wharf...|$|E
50|$|Tivoli {{is part of}} the Port of Cork. It {{provides}} container handling, {{facilities for}} oil, livestock and ore and a roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) <b>ferry</b> <b>ramp.</b> It's a significant point of entry for imported motor vehicles. Tivoli is also a minor tourist area, and has a number of bed and breakfast establishments as well as the Silver Springs Hotel. The cedar trees, still growing in the area, are reputed to have been planted by Sir Walter Raleigh, who lived there briefly.|$|R
50|$|A ferry {{terminal}} {{exists at}} the park for emergency use. If ever a landslide or avalanche occurs between Porteau Cove and Vancouver or Porteau Cove and Squamish, the BC Government could send in a ferry to detour cars around the slide to Darrell Bay Terminal in Squamish or to Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver. Since slides occur so rarely on the Sea-to-sky Highway, the dock {{is open to the}} public as a promenade wharf. The pier is owned by BC Parks, but the <b>ferry</b> <b>ramp</b> and accessories is owned by Department of Highways.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A linkspan {{operated}} by Red Funnel in use, configured {{to serve the}} company's fleet of Raptor class car <b>ferries.</b> The <b>ramp</b> {{at the top of}} the linkspan has been raised to allow for departure.|$|R
50|$|Initially a linkspan was a ramp {{that was}} {{attached}} to the pier at one end and was suspended above the water at the other. The height above the water was controlled either by hydraulic rams or cables, these types of linkspans were less well designed for the various conditions of the tide, wave and current and so were superseded by underwater tank linkspans that through compressed air can be adjusted for <b>ferry</b> <b>ramp</b> height and often need no adjustment for tidal height. The aim of all this is to have the linkspan at the roughly same height above the water as that of the car deck on whichever ferry happens to be docking at the time. All that is then needed is for a ramp (usually on the vessel) to be lowered, bridging the gap between the ferry and the linkspan.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 the {{institution}} was officially closed {{as a result}} of overcrowding, deteriorating health conditions and maintenance concerns with the [...] "Otter". The institution was then transferred to the newly established Eventide Home {{on the site of the}} former RAAF Station Sandgate. Dunwich was then opened up to government land sales and mining of mineral sand resources. From 1947 to 1957 a number of passenger ferries serviced both Dunwich and Amity Point from Brisbane, Redland Bay and Cleveland. The first drive-on drive-off ferry commenced operation in 1964 and ran from Cleveland to Dunwich using the beach as a ramp for loading and unloading. However, with further development and an increase in sand mining a deep water car <b>ferry</b> <b>ramp</b> was needed. Consequently, plans were made to reclaim land to the south east of the causeway providing a place for barge landing. Today this reclaimed land is the site of barge and water taxi landings servicing an ever increasing number of residents and visitors.|$|R

50|$|The Direcção Geral dos Portos da Terceira e Graciosa (Directorate-General for the Ports of Terceira and Graciosa), {{presented}} on 25 October 2011, in the Centro Cultural e de Congressos (Cultural and Congress Centre) {{the elaboration of}} a project of the environmental impact study and process plans {{for the construction of}} a new cruiser terminal for the Bay of Angra. The terminal project with a dock of 350 - 400 m length, would expand the bay to a 12 m depth, and provide a 20 m wide support platform, with 20000 m2 area, and a <b>ferry</b> <b>ramp</b> for roll-on-roll-off operations for inter-island traffic. During the presentation issues were raised as to manoeuvrability of cruise ships within the confined spaces of the Bay, suggesting that the planned design would not permit ships much latitude to manoeuvre. The design called for a 500 m protective service area, but that a 900 m would be more viable: the mouth of the Monte Brasil channel would have to be expanded in order to support this limited service area.|$|R
