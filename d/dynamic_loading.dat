Thus, accurate analysis and precise investigation of stadium structure that is subjected to <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> are required for practical design and serviceability check of stadium structures. Moreover, it is desirable to measure and analyze the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> of spectator activities because these <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> {{can not be easily}} expressed in numerical formula. In this study, various <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> induced by spectator movements are measured and analyzed. These <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> induced by spectators movement of stadium structure can be classified into the impact load and the periodic <b>load.</b> These <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> can be expressed as Fourier harmonic <b>load.</b> And, these <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> could be applied for the accurate vibration analysis of a stadium structure.

[...] Severn continued his focus on the effects of earthquakes upon dams, particularly embankment dams which were widespread in the hydro-electric power stations being constructed during this period and outnumbered the previously dominant arch dams by ten to one in new construction. [...] The accurate modelling of embankment dams is difficult due to their mix of rocks and soil and little work had been carried out previously on their reaction to <b>dynamic</b> <b>loading,</b> such as was exerted by earthquakes. [...] Severn was a proponent of the use of finite element analysis in the modelling of such dams and pioneered the application of early digital computers to this task. [...] In the late 1970s Severn installed a 2m by 1m shaking table at Bristol and used it to derive a set of guidelines for the design of earthquake resistance in embankment dams, they were the first of their kind in the world. [...] Severn's table was computer controlled and used a series of eccentricly-mounted weights to exert forces upon embankment dam models that he constructed of sand and wax. [...] He refined his models using real-world data collected from a dam in Wales. [...] Under Severn's direction Bristol's Department of Civil Engineering became the top-rated such department in the world and his Earthquake Engineering Research Centre, the largest institution of its kind in the UK, was internationally renowned.|$|E
