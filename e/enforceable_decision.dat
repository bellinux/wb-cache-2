40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the conventional view of contemporary international adjudication. It identifies {{a new generation}} of international tribunals, which has been largely ignored by commentators, and argues that these tribunals offer a highly successful, alternative model to traditional public-international-law adjudicatory bodies. The proliferation of international tribunals is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most significant developments in international law over the past century. The subject has given rise to an extensive and robust body of academic commentary. Although commentators reach widely divergent conclusions about many aspects of international law and adjudication, they all agree that international tribunals differ fundamentally from national courts. In particular, according to the commentary, international tribunals such as the International Court of Justice lack the power to render <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions</b> or to exercise compulsory jurisdiction. This Article argues that commentators have proceeded from a flawed and incomplete understanding of contemporary international adjudication. Virtually all commentary on the subject ignores the development of a second generation of international tribunals, best represented by international commercial and investment tribunals, World Trade Organization panels, and claims-settlement mechanisms. Contrary to the conventional wisdom about international adjudication, this new generation of international tribunals has the power to exercise what is effectively compulsory jurisdiction and to render <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions</b> that can often be coercively executed against states and their commercial assets. These second-generation tribunals have been the most frequently used and, in many respects, the most successful form of international adjudication in recent decades. The caseloads of these tribunals have grown rapidly over the past forty years and now substantially exceed those of traditional public-international-law tribunals. Moreover, an analysis of state treatymaking practice over recent decades shows that states have virtually never concluded treaties accepting the jurisdiction of traditional first-generation tribunals—concluding less than one treaty per year—whereas they have frequently accepted the jurisdiction of second-generation tribunals capable of rendering enforceable decisions—accepting some fifty treaties per year. More fundamentally, second-generation tribunals have played an essential role in facilitating international trade, finance, and investment; have contributed to the development of important fields of international law; and have provided leading contemporary examples of international law working in practice. Although largely ignored by the commentary, the success and frequent use of second-generation tribunals have important implications for conventional analysis of international adjudication. The success of these tribunals flatly contradicts the claims, advanced by a number of academic commentators, that international adjudication is unimportant in contemporary international affairs and that states do not use international tribunals—particularly tribunals that would be effective. In reality, second-generation tribunals have been frequently and successfully used in vitally important fields, in part because they issue effective and <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions.</b> At the same time, the success of second-generation tribunals also contradicts prescriptions, offered by a number of commentators, that future international tribunals be modeled on “independent” first-generation tribunals or, alternatively, on entirely “dependent” adjudicative mechanisms. Successful second-generation tribunals exhibit a blend of structural characteristics that defy blanket prescriptions for either “independence” or “dependence” and that counsel for more tailored, nuanced institutional designs...|$|R

Despite {{the fact that it is}} this obliged person who has caused such enforcement by not fulfilling voluntarily what has been imposed upon him by the <b>enforceable</b> <b>decision,</b> the law has to provide a certain standard of protection. Thus, in the Czech legal environment, it creates above all a deferral and discontinuance of the enforcement of judgement (execution).

The thesis is divided into four chapters.

40|$|This Article {{offers the}} first {{systematic}} {{treatment of the}} relationship between commercial arbitration and testamentary arbitration. (By testamentary arbitration, I mean an arbitration clause contained in a will requiring beneficiaries to resolve differences over the estate by means of an <b>enforceable</b> <b>decision</b> by a private party rather than judicial resolution in a probate court.) Recent scholarship and jurisprudence have questioned the enforceability of these arrangements as incompatible with the requirement of a written 2 ̆ 2 agreement 2 ̆ 2 between parties to the arbitration. Contrary to these views, close examination of the historical record of testamentary arbitration leading to the Federal Arbitration Act 2 ̆ 7 s enactment reveals a rudimentary set of doctrines not unlike those found in modern American commercial arbitration jurisprudence. These doctrines cover topics such as the allocation of authority between courts and arbitrators, as well as judicial review of arbitration awards. These findings carry important implications for both testamentary arbitration and commercial arbitration. They respond to critics alleging that testamentary arbitration cannot be sustained absent express legislative fixes in state statutes. They also support the trend, found in recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, of cross-fertilizing arbitration precedent from one field (like labor or investment arbitration) into another (like commercial arbitration) ...|$|E

40|$|The subject. This paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} related to tax law with a special focus on legal regulation of the tax procedure contained in the Czech Tax Procedure Code. Attention is paid in particular to tax penalty payments and the “non bis in idem” principle. The purpose to identify ratio between penalty payments in tax procedure and in criminal procedure in context of “non bis in idem” principle. The methodological basis of the article is analysis of legislation and court practice of Czech republic, Austria, European Union, including formal legal analysis, comparative analysis, synthesis, systematic approach. The results and scope of application. The existing case law of the Czech criminal courts and of the Supreme Court {{was based on the}} legal opinion that a penalty payment imposed by the tax administration in a tax procedure constitutes no punishment, i. e. it is no sanction of criminal nature, so that even the final (<b>enforceable)</b> <b>decision</b> of the tax administration does not create a “ne bis in idem” 1 barrier in relation to criminal sanctions for the same taxesrelated non-compliant action (tax evasion) in respect of the penalty payment imposed by the tax administration. Conclusions. It would probably be advisable for the legislation to amend the relevant provisions of the Tax Procedure Code {{in a way that the}} tax authorities concentrate within the limits of their powers on proper tax collection and that the law enforcement authorities are authorized to punishments for deliberate tax evasion. A suggested amendment may therefore be the removal of the penalty payments from the Tax Procedure Code as the default interest itself is sufficient instrument enough to penalize the taxpayers. Another option is to keep the tax penalty payment in the Tax Procedure Code, but its imposition would only be considered after making sure that the result of any criminal proceedings does not constitute a “ne bis in idem” prohibition within the meaning of Art. 40 (5) of the Charter and Art. 4 (1) of the Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, Section 11 (1) f), g), h), (2) and Section 11 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{intends to}} discuss the four facets of the {{application}} of the law to the merits in arbitration. The first and more classic one is a conflict of laws issue. What law (or laws) or rules (or sets of rules) should, or can, the arbitrator apply to the merits of the dispute? The second is that of how, having identified the applicable law or set of rules, arbitrators go about ascertaining the content of the law or rules to be applied to the merits. The third facet is how arbitrators should actually apply the law and rules to the merits, once they have identified them and ascertained their content. The fourth facet, which straddles the others, is that of mandatory rules: when, why and how should arbitrators apply mandatory rules and which ones should they apply? Specific legal rules exist only in relation to the first of these facets, and even those leave a great discretion to arbitrators. An inquiry into the criteria for the exercise of that discretion in relation to all the aspects of the application of substantive law – and the relevance of ethics in this context – is therefore fundamental to determine the proper conduct of arbitrators {{as well as for the}} outcome of the arbitral process. Indeed, except in the marginal case of ex aequo et bono arbitration, together with the assessment of the facts the identification and application of the rules applicable to the merits is the most crucial aspect of an arbitration, the aim of which is the settlement of the dispute by application of the law. For the purposes of the present discussion, the term ethics is not used in its technical and philosophical sense of rules of behavior based on ideas about what is morally good and bad. It is used in the mundane sense in which it used in arbitration, as shorthand for the unwritten duties of the participants in the arbitral process, particularly arbitrators, with regard to the fair and efficient conduct of the arbitration in the absence of enforceable legal obligations. Also with regard to {{the application of the}} law to the merits ethics can be seen to encompass the duty of the arbitrators to “do a good job” as arbitrators. Spelled out, this is the duty to conform to the legitimate expectations of the parties and to standards of predictability, render a just and <b>enforceable</b> <b>decision,</b> avoid arbitrariness and respect general interests...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current legal {{framework}} of the communications market within the European Union and concludes that despite efforts to strengthen consumer protection within a B 2 C dispute context, {{there is still a}} gap between conferred rights and guarantees and the ability to effectively exercise them. The paper proposes the creation of a system, holistic in its approach, to bridge that gap and improve access to justice. The proposed orientation requires a reorganisation of roles and the active participation of all market stakeholders, including consumers. Though not technologically innovative, the mapped system’s intended contribution is its articulation with the market and its responsiveness to consumers. Being conducive to binding and <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions,</b> this alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system aims at establishing structural and procedural safeguards that ward due process, impartiality and rule of law while benefiting from the swiftness and lessened formality of traditional ADR. Information and communications technology plays a key part in enhancing those benefits even further. Finally some considerations concerning an eventual harmonisation of ADR in a B 2 C European communications context and its benefits are made. Consequently a suggestion for a collaborative network between equivalent ADR Bodies on a national level and, for instance, BEREC or the European Consumers Centres Network is presented. ADR Bodies, such as the one proposed, and complaint-management agencies are concluded to be ever closer to a role of forefront of the justice system, carrying out an essential role in dispute prevention.

40|$|There are few {{real-world}} economic {{transactions that}} do not involve an element of trust, yet in textbook economics trust is not prominently discussed. In that world, perfectly informed and computationally endowed agents reach optimal, <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions</b> in continuously harmonising exchanges. Trust is therefore linked to deviations from the textbook ideal: incomplete information, costly enforcement, and computational limitations faced by agents. Trust can then {{be thought of as}} an algorithm, in other words, a way of resolving uncertainty in a complex world. In this sense trust may be seen as a form of expectation concerning the behaviour of other agents whose actions and intentions cannot be (fully) observed. This paper pursues this approach by "running the algorithm backwards" and trying to establish what factors led a 19 century provincial English bank to trust different loan applicants. Using a data-set of some 200 loan decisions, and knowing the size of collateral (if any) requested, we develop a method to estimate the probability that the bank attached to each borrower's promise to repay (i. e., the trust the bank had towards the borrower), adjusting for stages in the business cycle. We then regress this estimated probability on a variety of observable borrower characteristics. We find that trust is not correlated with a priori expected variables, such as borrower's assets or frequency of interaction. This suggests that trust was built up in other interactions, possibly through social or religious networks, and that the banking relationship reflected information available to bank directors other than what was purely pertinent to the borrowers' economic conditions. This has strong implications for the allocation of credit to industry in 19 th century England...|$|R

The typology provides {{a base for}} speculations about the long term future of the State. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE STATE It is useful to distinguish {{the state and the}} political system. The state {{can be seen as a}} combination of two basic functions, each of which must rely on three structural elements. The first of the two basic func-tions is the enforcement state, which I shall call State A. Its three ma-jor structural elements are, first, its enforcement machinery, that is, the armed forces and the police with material appendages, buildings, and equipment, which were the well known apparatus of force of interest to Marxist writers. The second, or decision-making part, con-sists of the high-level decision makers, legislators and rulers in full-time roles, because a machinery that is capable of enforcing must know what to enforce, and this, of course, will change with differing situa-tions. The third or implementing part of this enforcement state con-sists of the middle-level civilian managers and decision makers in the service of directly enforceable legislation, administration and coordina-tion. State A is the enforcement state/decision state that produces <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions,</b> or those decisions which are expected to be enforceable. Talcott Parsons used to call them &dquo;binding&dquo; decisions. The second basic function characterizes what I shall call State B, the service state, producing desired goods and services.

40|$|In 1968 the Kilbrandon report {{detailed}} {{a system}} of panels for dealing with ‘juvenile delinquency’ which became {{the foundation for the}} Scottish Children’s Hearings System (CHS) in Scotland. The CHS makes decisions and recommendations about children where professionals feel compulsory measures of supervision may be necessary for the child’s wellbeing. Compulsory measures of supervision may be a helpful response to many serious issues in a child’s life, including failure to attend school, parental abuse or neglect, or criminal behaviour. As a result, almost all criminal and care and protection cases for children in Scotland up to the age of 18 are heard by the CHS. The CHS has wide-ranging powers, including the ability to dismiss charges or allegations, remove children from their parents, and mandate compulsory measures of supervision. Each hearing is presided over by a panel of three lay people who have undergone relevant training, this panel makes decisions based on the principle of {{the best interests of the}} child. Despite being a tribunal making legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>decisions</b> it has, until recently, been relatively uncommon for legal representation to be present in a hearing except in a minority of cases where there was a requirement that the child is represented by a lawyer (eg when secure care is being considered). Parents and relevant others have always been able to bring legal representation to a hearing, but following recent successful legal challenges regarding the right to representation, financial aid has been made available to parents and relevant other’s wishing to appoint a lawyer. This has led to an increase in legal representation in children’s hearings. Objective: This research was commissioned by the Scottish Legal Aid Board to examine the role of legal representatives in the children’s hearings process. In particular, in relation to the ethos of the hearings, the performance of lawyers/solicitors, monitoring and feedback mechanisms, and training needs of lawyers/solicitors to participate effectively in the hearings. Methods: A mixed methods approach was utilised, in order to gather a wide range of information. This included surveys made available to all solicitors, social workers, reporters and panel members involved in CHS, focus groups with samples from these same populations, interviews with children, and representatives from outside of the formal CHS system. Results: The introduction of financial aid and corresponding increase in the legal presence in the CHS has produced mixed results. While respondents were careful not to over-generalise regarding the performance of lawyers/solicitors, there were concerns regarding: the introduction of an adversarial style; a change in emphasis away from the best interests of the child and towards the rights of the parent(s); the introduction of delay into proceedings; a lack of understanding of child development, communication and attachment; and disruption of social workers’ relationships with the family. Conclusion: Legal representation in lay-tribunals such as the CHS can present challenges. Training of solicitors in child development and other topics, the introduction of a compulsory scheme of pre-registration training, and ongoing inter-agency training to facilitate all parties’ understandings of different roles could be helpful...|$|R
40|$|The 1976 Act announces broad {{exclusive}} rights, {{offset by}} {{a myriad of}} specific exemptions, and one wide exception for “fair use. ” In words and intent, the exclusive rights are capacious, but new technologies may have caused some of the general phrases to become more constraining than {{might have been expected}} from a text whose drafters took pains to make forward-looking. Thus, the scope of the reproduction right turns on the meaning of “copy;” the reach of the distribution right on “distribute copies” and “transfer of ownership;” the range of the public performance right on “public” and “perform. ” Entrepreneurs and users of new technological means of exploiting copyrighted works have urged narrow constructions of each of these terms, arguing that broad interpretations will chill future innovation (and suppress present markets for copyright-exploiting devices or services). Copyright owners, concerned that unfettered new uses will supplant traditional copyright-controlled markets, have contended that the literal language, or, failing that, congressional intent, encompass the contested use. In addition, new technologies have called into question the identification of the person who “does” the copyright-implicating acts. Who makes a copy when the act is decomposed into steps taken by different actors? Who performs or displays a work when the work resides on one person’s server, but the public perceives it through another person’s website? Several US courts have narrowly construed the reach of the exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, public performance and public display, thus putting into doubt their efficacy in the digital environment. In particular, the Second Circuit’s recent decision in Cartoon Networks v. CSC Holdings, if followed, could substantially eviscerate the reproduction and public performance rights. The growing number of decisions rejecting a “making available” right attests to some difficulties in adapting the distribution right to online exploitation. By contrast, one bright spot for authors appears in the area of moral rights, in which digital media may provide a means to make at least some authors’ attribution interests <b>enforceable.</b> Because the <b>decisions</b> emanate from lower courts, including first-level courts, {{it is too soon to}} discern whether US copyright law is adopting a constricted conception of the scope of the economic rights under copyright, and if so, whether the decisions betoken an evolving (if often unarticulated) determination that copyright prerogatives should yield to technological preferences.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-return}} of rejected international protection applicants does not enjoy a high political profile on its own, {{but has been}} discussed {{as part of a}} global debate on asylum. Significant efforts are required when considering the wide spectrum of possible reasons of non-return, some reasons depending on the countries of destination, others on the returnee himself/herself. In this respect, reasons of non return range from the non-respect of deadlines, the issuance of travel documents, postponement of removal for external reasons to the returnee, for medical reasons, the resistance of the third-country national and the lack of diplomatic representation of Luxembourg, to name but a few. In regards to the procedure, in Luxembourg the rejection of the international protection application includes the return decision. The Minister in charge of Immigration, through the Directorate of Immigration, issues this decision. The return <b>decision</b> only becomes <b>enforceable</b> when all appeals are exhausted and the final negative decision of rejection of the competent judicial authority enters into force, as appeals have suspensive effects. This decision also sets out the timeframe during which the rejected international protection applicant has to leave the country. In case the applicant does not opt for a voluntary return, the decision will also include the country to which s/he will be sent. In general, the decision provides for a period of 30 days during which the applicant has the option to leave voluntarily and to benefit from financial support in case of assisted voluntary return through the International Organization for Migration (IOM). There are two exceptions to this rule: the applicant who is considered a threat to national security, public safety or homeland security and the applicant who has already been issued a return decision before. The declaration and documentation provided during the procedure of international protection can be used to facilitate return. Subsequent applications are possible, in particular if new evidence of facts appears resulting in an increased likelihood of the applicant to qualify for international protection. For rejected international protection applicants who did not opt for voluntary return and did not receive any postponement of removals, a certain (limited) support is available while waiting for the execution of the <b>enforceable</b> return <b>decision.</b> As such, they continue to stay in reception facilities and to receive certain social benefits unless they transgress any internal rules. If an urgent need exists, rejected applicants may be granted a humanitarian social aid. However, they are not entitled to access the labour market or to receive ‘pocket money’ or the free use of transport facilities. They benefit from an access to education and training, however this access cannot constitute a possible reason for non-return. These benefits are available to rejected applicants until the moment of their removal. In order to enforce the return decision and prevent absconding, the Minister may place the rejected international applicant in the detention centre, especially if s/he is deemed to be obstructing their own return. Other possible measures include house arrest, regular reporting surrendering her/his passport or depositing a financial guarantee of 5000 €. Most of these alternatives to detention were introduced with the Law of 18 December 2015 which entered into force on 1 st January 2016. As a consequence, detention remains the main measure used to enforce return decisions. A number of challenges to return and measures to curb them are detailed in this study. A part of these measures have been set up to minimize the resistance to return from the returnee. First and foremost is the advocacy of the AVRR programme and the dissemination of information relating to this programme but also the establishment of a specific return programme to West Balkan countries not subject to visa requirements. Other measures aim at facilitating the execution of forced returns, such as police escorts or the placement in the detention centre. Finally, significant efforts are directed towards increasing bilateral cooperation and a constant commitment to the conclusion of readmission agreements. No special measures were introduced after 2014 in response to the exceptional flows of international protection applicants arriving in the EU. While the Return service within the Directorate of Immigration has continued to expand its participation to European Networks and in various transnational projects in matters of return, this participation was already set into motion prior to the exceptional flows of 2014. As for effective measures curbing challenges to return, this study brings to light the AVRR programme but especially the separate return programme for returnees from West Balkan countries exempt of visa requirements. The dissemination of information on voluntary return is also considered an effective policy measure, the information being made available from the very start of the international protection application. Among the cases where return is not immediately possible, a considerable distinction has to be made in regards to the reasons for the non-return. Indeed, in cases where the delay is due to the medical condition of the returnee or to material and technical reasons that are external to the returnee, a postponement of removal will be granted. This postponement allows for the rejected applicant to remain on the territory on a temporary basis, without being authorized to reside and may be accompanied by a measure of house arrest or other. In cases of postponement for medical reasons and of subsequent renewals bringing the total length of postponement over two years, the rejected applicant may apply for a residence permit for private reasons based on humanitarian grounds of exceptional seriousness. Nevertheless, apart from this exception, no official status is granted to individuals who cannot immediately be returned. Several measures of support are available to beneficiaries of postponement to removal: they have access to accommodation in the reception centres they were housed in during their procedure, they may be attributed humanitarian aid, they continue to be affiliated at the National Health Fund, they continue to have access to education and professional training and they are allowed to work through a temporary work authorization. The temporary work authorization is only valid for a single profession and a single employer {{for the duration of the}} postponement to removal, although this is an extremely rare occurrence in practice. OLAI may allocate a humanitarian aid might be allocated if the individual was already assisted by OLAI during the procedure of her/his international protection application. All of these measures apply until the moment of return. The study also puts forth a number of best practices such as the Croix-Rouge’s involvement in police trainings, their offer of punctual support to vulnerable people through international networking or the socio-psychological support given to vulnerable people placed in the detention centre among others. A special regard has to be given to AVRR programmes and their pre-departure information and counselling, the dissemination of information and the post-arrival support and reintegration assistance. Indeed, stakeholders singled the AVRR programme out as a best practice and the Luxembourgish government has made voluntary return a policy priority for a long time. However, this increased interest in voluntary returns has to be put into perspective as research shows that sustainable success of voluntary return and reintegration measures is only achieved for a very restricted number of beneficiaries (namely for young, autonomous and dynamic returnees with sizeable social networks and who were granted substantial social capital upon return). Hence, returning women remains a sensitive issue, especially if they were fleeing abusive relationships. Another factor contributing to hardship set forth by research is the difficult reintegration of returnees that have lived outside of their country of return for a prolonged period of time and are therefore unable to rely on social networks for support or for a sense of belonging. Based on these considerations, NGOs and academia cast doubts on the ‘voluntary’ nature of these return programmes, their criticism targeting the misleading labelling of these policy measures...|$|R
40|$|Antras šansas“ (angl. fresh start) tai principas, suteikiantis skolininkui galimybę dar kartą įsitraukti į ekonominę veiklą, kuris yra pagrindu fizinių asmenų bankroto institutui tiek kontinentinės, tiek bendrosios teisės tradicijų šalyse. Tačiau dėl skirtingų šalių finansų politikų, individualiai formuojamų remiantis teisinės valstybės principu, nėra vieningo fizinių asmenų bankroto reguliavimo darbe keliamos problemos atžvilgiu. Lietuvos atveju, praktikoje susiduriama su įstatymo taikymo problema, jei skolininko nemokumo priežastis yra prievolė, kilusi iš tyčinės nusikalstamos veikos padarinių – žalos atlyginimo. Nors kaip problema akcentuojamos nusikalstamos veikos, turinčios apgaulės elementą, tačiau, darbo autorės nuomone, neturėtų būti ignoruojamos kitos veikos, kuriomis pažeidžiama kreditoriaus nuosavybė. Siekiant išsiaiškinti, ar kreditorių, kurių reikalavimai kilo dėl BK 178 - 189 str. nusikalstamų veikų, nuosavybės teisės ribojimas yra suderinamas su teisinės valstybės principu, darbe iškeliama hipotezė – dėl BK 178 - 189 str. nurodytų nusikalstamų veikų atlikimo atsiradusių reikalavimų, jei jie yra skolininko nemokumo priežastimi, nurašymas nepasibaigus skolininko teistumo terminui prieštarauja teisinės valstybės principui. Grindžiant hipotezę pirmoje darbo dalyje yra analizuojama teisinės valstybės principo koncepcija bei interpretacija šiuolaikinėje teisėje. Remiantis įvairių autorių teorinėmis studijomis teigtina, kad teisinės valstybės principas nors ir turi nekintančius pamatinius dėsnius, tačiau kiekvienoje šalyje yra individualus. Šioje darbo dalyje nustatyta, kad FABĮ taikyme kylančios problemos sudaro pagrindą teigti, jog išimčių formuluotės neatitinka teisinio aiškumo reikalavimo. Antroje darbo dalyje atlikus sąžiningumo ir apgaulės elemento analizę darytina išvada, kad tiek baudžiamojoje, tiek civilinėje teisėje sutampa ta apgaulės supratimo dalis, kuri apgaule pripažįstamas kito asmens suklaidinimas pranešant jam melagingas žinias arba nutylint tikruosius faktus. O atlikus nusikalstamų veikų analizę darytina išvada, nusikalstamos veikos ekonomikai ir verslo tvarkai, yra specialiosios normos nusikalstamų veikų nuosavybei atžvilgiu, o nusikalstamos veikos finansų sistemai atlikimo būdo atžvilgiu tap pat itin panašios į nusikalstamas veikas nuosavybei. Trečioje darbo dalyje yra skiriamas dėmesys užsienio šalių praktikai atsižvelgiant į skirtingas teisinių tradicijų nuostatas ir pateikiama darbo autorės nuomonė, paremta pirmojoje ir antrojoje darbo dalyse atlikta analize bei užsienio šalių praktika. Atsižvelgiant į atliktą analizę darytina išvada, jog hipotezė, kad dėl BK 178 - 189 str. nurodytų nusikalstamų veikų atlikimo atsiradusių reikalavimų, jei jie yra skolininko nemokumo priežastimi, nurašymas nepasibaigus skolininko teistumo terminui prieštarauja teisinės valstybės principui yra patvirtinta. Does Releasing Damages Caused by Intentional Criminal Acts Under Law on the Bankruptcy of Natural Persons of the Republic of Lithuania Contradict to the Rule of Law? Common {{principle}} {{that is the}} ground of institute of natural person insolvency is capacity to restore already over-indebted natural person/ consumer access to credit {{and the provision of}} new products in financial services. Generally this concept is called “fresh start” doctrine. Even though doctrine of “fresh start” is the product of Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, Continent law countries successfully adopted it but with some modifications. The main difference between legal traditions is that European continental law countries exclude open access to insolvency because person that may enjoys it must be worthy. Meanwhile, the main function of consumer bankruptcy regime is to serve credit market. This difference between legal traditions as well indicates one of the basics principles in lawful community – the rule of law. The rule of law lets countries create an efficient and independent justice system which ensures predictable, timely and <b>enforceable</b> judicial <b>decisions</b> that can contribute to trust and stability – both important elements for a sound business and investment environment. In other words, by leading rule of law countries can and are formulating financial policies that are different from each other and those differences are the reason of inability to create common ruling for exceptions to refuse to release the debtor from specific obligations. On contrary, there is no crucial evidence that abovementioned thesis is entirely true because some similarities exist, yet some creditors in different countries but in the same situations become more equal than the others. In order to elucidate if restriction of creditors property rights whose claims aroused because of breach of Articles 178 - 189 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania contradict to the rule of law, the hypothesis put forward that the release of damages that aroused of breach of Articles 178 - 189 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania if they are cause of debtors insolvency and term of debtors conviction is not over contradict to the rule of law. The first part of this paper is dedicated to the source of rule of law and nowadays interpretation as well as analysis {{of the rule of law}} in Lithuania. The analysis has been shown that the institute of Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania is interpreted through official constitutional doctrine that is formulated by constitutional justice institution. One of the most important elements of constitutional doctrine is legal certainty that oblige legislative body to avoid ambiguity and formulate legal act in set terms. These criterions apply also to Natural person insolvency law of the Republic of Lithuania. Nonetheless, practitioners face with the problem in applying this law when the situation considers about refusal to declare bankruptcy to a person, if the main reason of his/ her insolvency is obligation that arises from consequence of intentional criminal activity – the obligation to repay damages. Even though in practice all attention is going to criminal activities that have fraud element, yet should not be ignored others criminal activities that involve breach of creditors property. This attitude is followed by analysis and comparison of criminal activities that pointed out in Article 5 of Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania with criminal activities that involve breach of creditor’s property, property rights and property interests, that are analyzed in the second part of this paper. Specified norms of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania are selected because of consequences of intentional criminal activity (damages) and conformities in content of norms. The first look in Articles 207, 208, 209, 216, 222, 223 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania in comparison with Articles 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania showing differences between victim’s personality. One set of crimes seems to include more country’s attention than the other because of financial policy, meaning that damage to certain type of creditors may have negative consequences to entirely country. The proof of importance of certain type creditors may also be Article 5 of Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania. On one hand, legislative body choice to exclude from Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania criminal activities that specified in Articles 178 - 189 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania let courts have more discretion in decision whether or not initiate bankruptcy procedure to natural person. On the other hand, damages that arose from those criminal activities and are the reason of insolvency are not absolute ground for refusal to initiate bankruptcy proceeding and that might lead to legal uncertainty. Furthermore, non-existing unanimous practice in this field might lead to situation when one person at the same conditions will bankrupt, the other will not. Legal uncertainty also has influence on increasing the workload of the courts. The statement is based on statistical data. During year 2016 according to Prison Department under the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Lithuania data released from prison for robbery were 439 people, for theft – 677 people, for extortion – 62 people, for fraud – 199 people, imprisoned for robbery were 354 people, for theft – 599 people, for extortion – 36, for fraud – 169 people. Because of lack of clarity in Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania those who were released from prison might be possible applicants to file for bankruptcy. The third part of this paper consists of analysis of foreign countries legislations in the field of exceptions in releasing debtors from specific obligations. The analysis has been shown that 7 countries of Anglo-Saxon law legal tradition are tend to formulate abstract norms that refers to principle of good faith while countries of Continental law legal tradition are tend to formulate specified norms that refers to certain crimes. This part of paper also includes author’s position about wording of norms of exception in Natural Person Insolvency Law of the Republic of Lithuania. The hypothesis that the release of damages that aroused of breach of Articles 178 - 189 of Penal Code of the Republic of Lithuania if they are cause of debtors insolvency and then term of debtors conviction is not over contradict to the rule of law has been proved...|$|R
