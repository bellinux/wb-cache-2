40|$|Mini-Baja is {{a special}} type of vehicle used for {{recreational}} and exploration purposes. In many aspects it is similar to an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) except that it is much smaller in size. An international competition is organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) for universities throughout the world {{to design and fabricate}} their vehicles and then compete against each other. The objective of the present research was to carry out finite element analysis and crash simulations for a Mini-Baja chassis structure. The aim of this task was to write a comprehensive finite <b>element</b> <b>guide</b> for a Mini-Baja SAE vehicle that had already been built by students at the University of Windsor for the year 2010 Baja competition in Rochester New York. Initially, an example of a Z-frame is explained and evaluated by simple hand calculations. Subsequently, the preliminary design of the Mini-Baja roll cage was generated using CAD data. To study the effects of stress and deformation on the frame members, linear static analysis followed by transient modal superposition analysis was carried out as the first steps toward this project. The static analysis in this thesis was used to arrive at an acceptable mesh size for the Mini-Baja roll cage dynamic analysis. Additionally, the more realistic frontal impact analysis was performed on the Mini-Baja vehicle at a cruise velocity of 48 km/h (30 mph). Different FEA commercial packages were used throughout the project and results obtained from Abaqus/CAE and LS-DYNA were compared with one another. Furthermore, crash test simulations for side impact and vehicle-to-vehicle crash scenarios were also performed for the Mini-Baja frame to evaluate the structural rigidity and vehicle behaviour due to crash...|$|E

Instead, we let the distribution of the <b>elements</b> <b>guide</b> the choice of branching factors.

This structure, the level-compressed trie, inherits the good properties of binary tries with respect to neighbour and range searches, while the external path length is significantly decreased. It also has the advantage of being easy to implement. Our analysis shows that the expected depth of a stored element is Θ (log Λ n) for uniformly distributed data...|$|R

We find that besides tRNA introns, the majority of box C/D snoRNAs is associated with BHB elements. Not all circularized sRNAs, however, can be explained by BHB elements, suggesting that {{there is at least one}} other mechanism of RNA circularization at work in Archaea.
