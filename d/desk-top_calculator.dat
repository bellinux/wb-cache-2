40|$|A {{method for}} calculatingradioimmunoassay {{standard}} curves, {{based on the}} theory of Ekins etal.,isdescribed. Becausea four-parameter model is used, nonlinear stan-dard curves are the result. The calibration curve is fitted to the measured standard points {{by means of a}} weighted least-squares method. The program based on this model can be easily processed on a <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator.</b> For all 250 runs of six different assays, very good standard curves could be obtained. The mean deviation between the con-centrations of the standard points and the corresponding calculated values was about 6 %. In 26 % of the cases it could be shown that the model we describe gave signifi-cantly better results than did two simpler ones. Many methods have been published for the calcula-tion of radioimmunoassay standard curves (1). These can roughly be divided into two large groups: (a) those based on empirical models (2) and (b) those based on the first-order mass-action law (3, 4). The simple models from both groups can be handled on a <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator,</b> whereas the more complex ones often require iteration procedures and consequently a large computer. However, simplifications in the model result in some cases in badly fitted standard curves. Therefore a more complex model is advisable. When processing on a <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator</b> is necessary, an iterative calculation cannot be used. We have been able, however, to apply a regression analysis to a more complex model from group b. Materials and Methods To set up the model, we used equation 1 as a starting point (5) : R 2 + R(1 + K*p *- K*q) - K 5 q hK(R + 1) R =...|$|E

The user can freely select the fields provided in the visual representation of the spreadsheets and enter numerical figures there. The calculation program then ensures that the mathematical relations linked to a specific problem are constantly maintained by automatically changing the values in all other cells after their input. The user has an overview of all the relevant parameters during all these processes and can thus follow the entire process of the calculation...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{methods are}} {{available}} for the graphical dis-play of radioimmunoassay dose-response curves, for curve-fitting and dose interpolation, for statistical quality control, and for automation and computerization of data processing. The relative merits of these approaches are discussed. Minimal requirements for radioimmunoassay data-processing systems are presented. The features of an “ideal ” system are discussed.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn this thesis, drag and performance {{data from the}} A- 7 E Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization Manual (NATOPS) were reduced {{to a series of}} analytical expressions and implemented in a mission planning program. The program was designed to be compatible with <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculators</b> (64 K memory) of the type used in aircraft carrier Strike Operations Centers and to be interactive, so that air wing and operations personnel may use it regularly for mission planning All or part of 15 NATOPS performance charts were reduced using math modeling techniques which included curve- f i t ting and cross-plotting coefficients. Program implementation was demonstrated on an IBM 3033 using a Waterloo BASIC compiler, and the program was checked for accuracy and operational suitability by a sample group of Navy attack pilots.

J. 136, 935 [...] 945]. The simplifying assumptions used in these calculations have been criticized [Madsen, Everett, Sparrow & Fowkes (1977) FEBS Lett. 79, 313 [...] 316]. A more detailed analysis using a programmable <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator</b> is described, which shows that the errors introduced by the simplifying assumptions are small, particularly when the specific radioactivity of the free amino acid rises rapidly to a constant value...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an interactive statistical quality-control system for the small- to medium-sized radioimmunoassay laboratory, {{which can be used}} in a programmable <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator</b> instead of the medium- or large-scale computer systems usually required. The design of this quality-control system is modeled after the suggestions of Rodbard and has three components. The first component evaluates the relationship between the measured response variable of the radioimmunoassay and the precision (or variance) of these measurements. This derived relationship is then used in the second component of the system as the basis for the weighting function used to calculate an iterative, weighted, least-squares regression of the logit-log transformation of the dose-response curve. The third component uses the quality-control parameters statistically calculated fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{labelling}} {{of proteins}} by the iodine monochloride method was studied {{by using a}} mathematical model. The equations used were primarily derived from the mass law equation of the isotopic exchange reaction between [125 I]iodide and iodine monochloride. For convenient application, all equations were programmed into a computing <b>desk-top</b> <b>calculator.</b> To support {{the validity of the}} theoretical model, a series of iodinations of insulin were performed under various labelling conditions. The results of these experiments compare well with the theoretically derived values. Deviations from the theoretical values occurring at molar ratios of [125 I]iodide to iodine monochloride 4. 0 are explained and suggestions made about how to prevent them. The mathematical model was used to simulate the isotopic exchange, and the iodination reaction under various conditions, to study (a) the influence of the amount of [125 I]iodide on the amount of [125 I]iodine monochloride formed, (b) the influence of the specific radioactivity of [125 I]iodide on the amount of [125 I]iodine monochloride formed, and (c) the influence of the specific radioactivity of [125 I]iodide on the number of millicuries needed for labelling to a desired extent...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} {{hardware and}} software package for the accumulation and rapid analysis of multiple alpha pulse height spectra has been developed. The system utilizes a 4096 -channel analyzer capable of accepting up to sixteen inputs from solid-state surface barrier detectors via mixer-router modules. The analyzer is interfaced to a <b>desk-top</b> programmable <b>calculator</b> and thermal line printer. A chained software package including spectrum printout, peak analysis, plutonium- 238 and plutonium- 239 data reduction, and automatic energy calibration routines was written. With the chained program a complete printout, peak analysis, and plutonium data reduction of a 512 -channel alpha spectrum are obtained in about three minutes with an accuracy within five percent of hand analyses.
