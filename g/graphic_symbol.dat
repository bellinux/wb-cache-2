During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then <b>graphic</b> <b>symbol</b> communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and speech synthesis, have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities.|$|E

In the case of English <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols,</b> people could easily learn to understand them.

Furthermore, Maurer (1985) points out that symbolic communication has existed and been developed for some time. Thus, pictogram language can be a learnable communication tool...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} early years teachers’ understanding {{and use of}} <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols,</b> defined as the visual representation(s) used to communicate one or more “linguistic” concepts, {{which can be used}} to facilitate science learning. The study was conducted in Cyprus where six early years teachers were observed and interviewed. The results indicate that the teachers had a good understanding of the role of symbols, but demonstrated a lack of understanding in regards to <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> specifically. None of the teachers employed them in their observed science lesson, although some of them claimed that they did so. Findings suggest a gap in participants’ acquaintance with the terminology regarding different types of symbols and a lack of awareness about the use and availability of <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> for the support of learning. There is a need to inform and train early years teachers about <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> and their potential applications in supporting children’s learning...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} Rudolf Modley’s {{efforts to}} achieve the standardization of international <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> from 1940 to 1976. Modley {{was one of the}} major activists in the movement to standardize <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> and his interest in standardization continued throughout his life. During the 1930 s and 1940 s, Modley, who had the experience of working under Otto Neurath in Vienna, worked in the making of charts in the U. S. After WWII, he continued to undertake various projects and institutional works devoted to developing international <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> until 1976, the year of his death. Although in some instances he is regarded as a ‘designer’, in reality, he was a consultant and coordinator in his field. By focusing on these more appropriate roles, this study examines his activities with the project of compiling a symbol dictionary and his work at Glyphs, Inc. Finally, some characteristics of Modley’s principles related to the standardization of <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> are discussed and evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Teachers, {{speech and}} {{language}} therapists, teaching assistants and nursery nurses {{are required to}} work together in a range of contexts in Foundation Stage (FS) school settings in the UK. In some cases these groups of practitioners are mutually involved in the implementation of a strategy or intervention and in the use of a particular tool or resource with children in these settings. The use of <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> with children in the FS of education is increasingly common in mainstream and special school settings and is an activity that may involve any combination of practitioners in these professional groups. <b>Graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> are used {{with a wide range of}} children for a diverse range of purposes. A study was conducted in which the experiences of teachers, speech and language therapists, teaching assistants and nursery nurses using <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> in FS school settings were explored. Practitioners in each of these groups working in the East Midlands region of the UK were interviewed about their experiences of using <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols.</b> The findings of this study encompassed a thematic framework and theoretical model depicting the patterns and themes emerging in the practitioners’ accounts. The proposed theoretical model suggests that practitioners are influenced by their unique professional reasoning processes, as well as the ways they perceive their own professional role and the roles of others.

A literature review was carried out to select: <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> and pictorial images used in health care area; and the design of new proposed methods for assistive products that had some graphic representantion of its processes. From this point the authors developed a preliminar hybrid characterization model based on symbolization of graphical representations (verbal, schematic, and pictorial) and approaches for pictogram design (geons, silhouettes and observation). The results of the characterization were discussed using as reference the hybrid model and the gaps. The assessment showed low use of <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols</b> for design processes representations, even when the authors were designers. ...|$|R

It consists of a Core Vocabulary of roughly 450 concepts that are taught in a specific order (there are 8 different stages). For example, stage 1 involves teaching vocabulary for immediate needs, like 'eat' and 'drink'. Later stages contain more complex and abstract vocabulary such as time and emotions. Once basic communication has been established, the student can progress in their language use, using whatever modes are most appropriate. Also, although the programme is organised in stages, it can be modified and tailored to the individual's needs. In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is a Makaton Resource Vocabulary of over 7,000 concepts which are illustrated with signs and <b>graphic</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|R
