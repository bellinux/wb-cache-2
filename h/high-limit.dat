40|$|The non-Newtonian {{behavior}} of a monodisperse concentrated dispersion of spherical particles was investigated using a direct numerical simulation method, {{that takes into account}} hydrodynamic interactions and thermal fluctuations accurately. Simulations were performed under steady shear flow with periodic boundary conditions in the three directions. The apparent shear viscosity of the dispersions was calculated at volume fractions ranging from 0. 31 to 0. 56. Shear-thinning behavior was clearly observed at high volume fractions. The low- and <b>high-limiting</b> viscosities were then estimated from the apparent viscosity by fitting these data into a semi-empirical formula. Furthermore, the short-time motions were examined for Brownian particles fluctuating in concentrated dispersions, for which the fluid inertia plays an important role. The mean square displacement was monitored in the vorticity direction at several different Peclet numbers and volume fractions so that the particle diffusion coefficient is determined from the long-time {{behavior of}} the mean square displacement. Finally, the relationship between the non-Newtonian viscosity of the dispersions and the structural relaxation of the dispersed Brownian particles is examined...|$|R

40|$|DO-transient {{nutrient}} controllers use the {{dissolved oxygen}} signal to attempt acetate threshold tracking during fed-batch cultivation of recombinant E coli. Here we apply DO-transient {{control to the}} production of Jembrana disease virus protein in complex Super Luria medium and compare performance against a <b>high-limit</b> pH-stat controller. For induction at medium cell density (harvest between 31 and 32. 5 g dcw L) a total productivity of 0. 27 g L h was achieved as compared to 0. 24 g L h with the <b>high-limit</b> pH-stat. For induction at high cell density (harvest at 60 g dcw L), decreased productivity (0. 12 g L h) was attributed to the effect of acetate accumulation on recombinant protein formation and a concomitant lowering of the critical growth rate. Our results suggest that complex media provides a difficult environment for the application of acetate threshold tracking DO-transient control because of difficulties in re-oxidizing acetate, and apparent localized production of acetate below the production threshold (as detected by the DO-transient controller as SPOURcrit). Configuring the DO-transient controller to avoid aggressive threshold probing is suggested as a means to improve performance and reduce acetate accumulation in complex media.

40|$|Federal {{law allows}} credit bureaus to report past {{bankruptcies}} {{up to ten}} years, so the financial implication of filing includes a ten-year influence on new credit. I document this influence with a large panel database of credit files which tracks many Chapter 7 filers past {{the moment when the}} filing disappears from potential creditors' view, providing a tightly controlled test of the filing's impact on credit access. The principal finding is that the bankruptcy flag has a big effect on the access of the more creditworthy past filers; when they lose their bankruptcy flags, their credit scores jump substantially and they open new credit relationships, <b>high-limit</b> bank cards in particular, quickly. Subsequently, the score-increases mostly reverse and delinquency is abnormally high. ...|$|E
40|$|Closing {{registers}} in {{forced air}} heating systems and leaving some rooms {{in a house}} unconditioned has been suggested {{as a method of}} quickly saving energy for California consumers. This study combined laboratory measurements of the changes in duct leakage as registers are closed together with modeling techniques to estimate the changes in energy use attributed to closing registers. The results of this study showed that register closing led to increased energy use for a typical California house over a wide combination of climate, duct leakage and number of closed registers. The reduction in building thermal loads due to conditioning only a part of the house was offset by increased duct system losses; mostly due to increased duct leakage. Therefore, the register closing technique is not recommended as a viable energy saving strategy for California houses with ducts located outside conditioned space. The energy penalty associated with the register closing technique was found to be minimized if registers furthest from the air handler are closed first because this tends to only affect the pressures and air leakage for the closed off branch. Closing registers nearer the air handler tends to increase the pressures and air leakage for the whole system. Closing too many registers (more than 60 %) is not recommended because the added flow resistance severely restricts the air flow though the system leading to safety concerns. For example, furnaces may operate on the <b>high-limit</b> switch and cooling systems may suffer from frozen coils...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interface}} in a charge-free, critical and near-critical binary fluid {{in the presence of}} an externally applied electric field is presented. At sufficiently large fields, the interface between the two phases of the binary fluid should become unstable and exhibit an undulation with a predefined wavelength on the order of the capillary length. As the critical point is approached, this wavelength is reduced, potentially approaching length-scales such as the correlation length or critical nucleation radius. At this point the critical properties of the system may be affected. In this paper, the flat interface of a marginally polar binary fluid mixture is stressed by a perpendicular alternating electric field and the resulting instability is characterized by the critical electric field E(sub c) and the pattern observed. The character of the surface dynamics at the onset of instability is found to be strongly dependent on the frequency f of the field applied. The plot of E(sub c) vs. f for a fixed temperature shows a sigmoidal shape, whose low and high frequency limits are well described by a power-law relationship, E(sub c) = epsilon(exp zeta) with zeta = 0. 35 and zeta = 0. 08, respectively. The low-limit exponent compares well with the value zeta = 4 for a system of conducting and non-conducting fluids. On the other hand, the <b>high-limit</b> exponent coincides with what was first predicted by Onuki. The instability manifests itself as the conducting phase penetrates the non-conducting phase. As the frequency increases, the shape of the pattern changes from an array of bifurcating strings to an array of column-like (or rod-like) protrusions, each of which spans the space between the plane interface and one of the electrodes. For an extremely high frequency, the disturbance quickly grows into a parabolic cone pointing toward the upper plate. As a result, the interface itself changes its shape from that of a plane to that of a high sloping pyramid...|$|E
