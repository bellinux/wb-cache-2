The analysed 157 spectra are organized in three classes:stimulant amphetamines (15 spectra), hallucinogenicamphetamines (7 spectra) and non-amphetamines (135 spectra). The correlation (i. e. discrimination) process isbased on sine modulated fringe-adjusted phase-inputjoint transform correlation {{which consists of}} twoprocedures: the amplitude pre-processing step and thefiltering step.

We investigate the <b>definition</b> <b>range</b> of this parametrization and find kinematic regions in which the YKP parametrization is inapplicable. These problems disappear if the newly proposed Modified Yano-Koonin-Podgoretskii parametrization is used. We then focus on the physical interpretation of the correlation radii obtained in the different parametrizations. While the extraction of the longitudinal source expansion from the YK rapidity {{is found to be}} rather robust against variations of the source density profiles, the extracted emission duration is quite sensitive to such variations and cannot be reliably extracted except for the case of extremely long source lifetimes.

40|$|Impulsivity and {{inconsistency}} in intertemporal choice (discounting) {{have drawn}} attention in econophysics and neuroeconomics. Although {{it is well}} established that most people often show irrational discounting (e. g., hyperbolic discounting), little is known regarding whether the irrationality is mitigated or not, when the choice was performed by someone else instead of subject herself. This point is important for economic policy-making. In order to compare consistency and impulsivity in choices for oneself versus someone else, we experimentally estimated the consistency parameter q in Tsallis’ statistics-based discount function for oneself and someone else, by assessing the points of subjective equality (indifference points) at 7 delays (1 week to 25 years) in humans. We observed that (i) most people are more inconsistent when the outcomes of intertemporal choice are only relevant to someone else (q ¼ 8. 89) than when relevant to oneself (q ¼ 2. 63), and (ii) impulsivity, distinguished from inconsistency by utilizing the Tsallis statistics-based q-exponential discount function, is also larger in the choice for someone else than for oneself. Our results indicate that (i) leaving decision-making processes with some others may neither reduce impulsivity nor correct inconsistency and (ii) when q-exponential discounting is utilized, the <b>definition</b> <b>range</b> of q-parameter should be extended to qo 0, and smaller (qo 1) and larger (q 41) values indicate more inconsistent discounting.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, I examine {{planning}} {{theory and}} practice as it enters a new paradigm of sustainability. Currently, few standards exist regarding the <b>definition,</b> <b>range,</b> or scope of sustainability planning, {{making it difficult to}} carry out and evaluate. Nevertheless, planners wield a great deal of influence in shaping the meaning of sustainability and in developing and executing sustainable plans and strategies for cities and their inhabitants. Although planning has advanced through application of Habermasian communicative action in research and practice in recent decades, this focus on public participation, discourse, and consensus leaves little room for examinations of the power relations underlying attempts to plan for a sustainable future in a pluralist society. This discussion explores an alternate theory of practice for planners and planning scholars alike who share the ideal of sustainability. In it I argue that sustainable planning requires an amended set of theoretical and practical tools and explore the idea that practical wisdom and creativity are among the skills that planners interested in sustainability will need to cultivate, supported by wise and creative planning theory. After a brief examination of the ways that planning can effect sustainability, I'll propose why cultivation of both wisdom and creativity in planning {{theory and practice}} may be essential in a sustainable future [...] planned or not [...] and offer for illustration an alternate model of sustainable planning research, practice, and theory development. Ultimately, this paper calls for expansion of planning's current conceptions of and approaches to sustainability and provides preliminary tools for readers interested in cultivating more sustainable planning methods...|$|E

Considering the high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and the relationship between their severity and cultural-economic condition in an area, this study was conducted to obtain the prevalence and plan the treatment of diseases. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a census method. All the adult patients with anemia signs and symptoms referred to the internal clinic of Shohada Ashayer were examined for CBC and RBC indices. The patients whose hemoglobin amounts fell in the anemia <b>definition</b> <b>range</b> were included. Iron level, serum ferritin, and TIBC assessments were performed and a questionnaire was completed for each patient. Then data were analyzed statistically. Results: Out of all the anemic patients, 44. 4 % suffered from iron deficiency anemia. The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 52. 3 % in women and 22. 6 % of the men. 60. 9 % of the patients in 15 - 49 age group and 24. 5 % of those aged over 49 had iron deficiency anemia. A significant relationship was found between age, sex, and iron deficiency anemia. No significant relationship was found between history of NSAIDs consumption and the incidence of iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: Since the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the studied population is high, considering improving and preventive interventions and comprehensive training programs in this regard seem to be necessary...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} {{rigorous}} investment analysis for photovoltaic power generation plants, a dynamic Business Plan has been studied. It {{allows us to}} determine, in real time, the investment parameters (Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Return on Investment, etc) starting from the technical, economical, financial and positional data. The Business Plan provides, as output, the exact values of the parameters (dependent variables or objective functions) basing on the exact values of the input variables (independent variables). By suitably varying the independent variables {{it is possible to}} obtain a sensitivity analysis on the dependent variables due to which different evaluations about the investment in multiple pre-set scenarios can be obtained. On the other hand, by using the Business Plan as data creator and then applying the Response Surface Methodology techniques, it has been possible to obtain mathematical functions (regression meta-models) which are able to explain the link among dependent and independent variables in the <b>definition</b> <b>range.</b> This approach allows to generate a sort of k dimensional state equation of order n for the different investigated economic parameters. These equations provide, in the chosen dimensional space (two or three-dimensional), a view of the dependent variable behaviour (e. g.

The descriptive ability of this approach has a higher level in terms of quality and reliability than a traditional sensitivity analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{address the}} {{advantages}} and drawbacks of quantitative polarized light microscopy {{for the study of}} myocardial cell orientation and to identify its contribution in the field. METHODS: Quantitative polarized light microscopy allows to measure the orientation of myocardial fibers into the ventricular mass. For each pixel of a horizontal section, this orientation is the mean value of the directions of all myosin filaments contained in the thickness of the section for each pixel of the section and is accounted for by two angles, the azimuth angle, which is the angle of the fiber in the plane of the section, and the elevation angle, which measures the way the fiber escapes from the section. The azimuth is accurately measured, and its range of definition is complete from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. The elevation angle can be defined only in the range 0 degrees to 90 degrees. It is accurately measured between 20 degrees and 70 degrees. From 0 degrees to 20 degrees, there is a systematic bias raising the measured values, and from 70 degrees to 90 degrees, the angle is not accurately measured. RESULTS: With this method, we validated Streeter's conjecture concerning the architecture of the left ventricle. We formulated a pretzel conjecture about the fiber architecture of the whole ventricular mass during fetal period. In our model, elaborated by visual analysis of registered maps of orientation, the fibers run like geodesics on a nested set of 'pretzels'. Next, the validity of the helical ventricular myocardial band model of Torrent-Guasp has been examined. It appears that the band model does not account for the patterns observed in our data during the fetal period. However, after the major events of postnatal cardiovascular adaptation, our data can neither discard nor confirm Torrent-Guasp's model. CONCLUSIONS: Present limitations of quantitative polarized light analysis can neither confirm nor discard the existing models of fiber orientation in the whole ventricular mass after the neonatal period. However, the problems of mathematical and experimental validation of these two models have been posed in a rigorous manner. Non-ambiguous fiber tracking and demonstration of these models will require significant improvement of the <b>definition</b> <b>range</b> of the elevation angle that should be extended to 180 degrees...|$|E
