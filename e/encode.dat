5000|$|VBR {{is created}} using the {{so-called}} single-pass <b>encoding</b> or multi-pass <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass <b>encoding</b> analyzes and <b>encodes</b> the data [...] "on the fly" [...] {{and it is}} also used in constant bitrate <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass <b>encoding</b> is used when the <b>encoding</b> speed is most important — e.g. for real-time <b>encoding.</b> Single-pass VBR <b>encoding</b> is usually controlled by the fixed quality setting or by the bitrate range (minimum and maximum allowed bitrate) or by the average bitrate setting. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is used when the <b>encoding</b> quality is most important. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> cannot be used in real-time <b>encoding,</b> live broadcast or live streaming. Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> takes much longer than single-pass <b>encoding,</b> because every pass means one pass through the input data (usually through the whole input file). Multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is used only for VBR <b>encoding,</b> because CBR <b>encoding</b> doesn't offer any flexibility to change the bitrate. The most common multi-pass <b>encoding</b> is two-pass <b>encoding.</b> In the first pass of two-pass <b>encoding,</b> the input data is being analyzed and the result is stored in a log file. In the second pass, the collected data from the first pass is used to achieve the best <b>encoding</b> quality. In a video <b>encoding,</b> two-pass <b>encoding</b> is usually controlled by the average bitrate setting or by the bitrate range setting (minimal and maximal allowed bitrate) or by the target video file size setting.|$|R
