40|$|With the {{infrared}} observations {{made by the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on board the EOS-Aqua satellite, which include the 9. 73 micron channel, a method is developed to deduce horizontal patterns of tropospheric ozone in cloud free conditions {{on a scale of}} about 100 km. It is assumed that on such small scale, at a given instant, horizontal changes in stratospheric ozone are small compared to that in the troposphere. From theoretical simulations it is found that uncertainties in the land surface emissivity and the vertical thermal stratification in the troposphere can lead to significant errors in the inferred tropospheric ozone. Because of this reason in order to derive horizontal patterns of tropospheric ozone in a given geographic area a tuning of this method is necessary {{with the help of a}} few dependent cases. After tuning, this method is applied to independent cases of MODIS data taken over Los Angeles basin in cloud free conditions to derive <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in the troposphere. Preliminary results indicate that the derived patterns of ozone resemble crudely the patterns of surface ozone reported by EPA...|$|E
40|$|As {{the most}} {{prominent}} feature of the polar stratosphere, polar vortex results in widespread changes in the climate system, especially in the ozone variation. In this study, the linkage between polar vortex and ozone depletion in Antarctic stratosphere during the period 1979 – 2016 is investigated; we calculated the averaged total column ozone within the polar vortex based on the vortex edge (− 28. 8 [*]PVU PV contour) instead of the geographical region defined by latitude and longitude. Results from the spatial patterns of ozone and polar vortex suggest that the morphological changes of polar vortex can impact the <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and the ozone within the polar vortex experiences a severe depletion in spring. The negative relationship between ozone and polar vortex in terms of vortex area, strength, and breakup time is significant with the correlation coefficients of − 0. 57, − 0. 68, and − 0. 76, respectively. The breakup time of polar vortex {{plays an important role}} in the relation between polar vortex and ozone depletion with the highest-value correlation coefficient among three polar vortex parameters.

Tai (36. 25 &deg;N, 117. 10 &deg;E, 1534 m a. s. l.) in Central East China (CEC) during the Mount Tai eXperiment 2006 (MTX 2006) : regional ozone photochemistry and aerosol studies in Central East China in June, 2006. The model reproduced the temporal and spatial variations <b>of</b> near-ground <b>ozone</b> and other pollutants. In particular, the model captured highly polluted and clean cases well. The simulated near-ground ozone over CEC is 60 – 85 ppbv (parts per billion by volume), higher than those (20 – 50 ppbv) in Japan and over the North Pacific. The simulated tagged tracer indicates that the regional-scale transport <b>of</b> chemically produced <b>ozone</b> over other areas in CEC contributes to the most fractions (49 %) of the near-ground mean ozone at Mt. Tai in June, rather than the in-situ photochemistry (12 %). Due to high anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions, the contributions <b>of</b> the ground <b>ozone</b> from the southern part of CEC plays the most important role (32. 4 ppbv, 37. 9 % <b>of</b> total <b>ozone)</b> in the monthly mean ozone concentration at Mt. Tai, which even reached 59 ppbv (62 %) on 6 – 7 June 2006. The monthly mean <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> chemically produced <b>ozone</b> from various source regions indicates that the spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> O 3 over CEC is controlled by the photochemical reactions.

40|$|We {{characterize}} a transboundary {{ozone pollution}} outbreak transported across East Asia in early May 2009 using new multispectral satellite observations <b>of</b> lowermost tropospheric <b>ozone</b> in synergy with other satellite data and models. Our analysis {{is focused on}} the daily evolution <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> pollution plumes initially formed over the North China Plain (NCP) and their transport pathways over Northern China, Korea, Japan and the surrounding seas. A main aspect of the study is an estimation of the contribution of photochemical production <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> along transport using the ratio <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> to carbon monoxide enhancements with respect to background levels derived from satellite data and also from chemistry-transport models. A key contribution of the analysis is the use of new satellite data offering unprecedented skills to observe the <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> lowermost tropospheric <b>ozone</b> over East Asia on daily basis, with a multispectral approach called IASI+GOME 2. These satellite observations are in good agreement with ozonesondes, with low mean biases (3  %), a precision of about 16  %, a correlation coefficient of 0. 85 and practically the same standard deviation for a comparison based on 2 years of data from 46 launching stations distributed worldwide, during all seasons. A similar agreement is also found over East Asia. Moreover, IASI+GOME 2 offers a unique capacity for observing the evolution <b>of</b> near surface <b>ozone</b> during pollution outbreaks (with 5  % bias and 0. 69 correlation), according to a comparison with surface in situ measurements during 2 major ozone events over several Japanese Islands. Single-band ozone retrievals, as those from IASI in the thermal infrared, do not capture such variability. Using IASI+GOME 2, we put in evidence that (i) ozone pollution plumes are transported by an anticyclonic circulation around the Yellow Sea from the NCP to Northern China, Korea and Japan, co-located with carbon monoxide plumes, (ii) over Northern China the plume splits into two pollution filaments with one mixing with freshly emitted pollutants and (iii) ozone is produced every day of the event accounting for an enhancement in concentration during transport across East Asia of up to ∼  84  % with respect to that produced over NCP. This estimation is done according to monotonically increasing values during 7 days of the ratio <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> to carbon monoxide enhancements within the transported pollution plumes from about ∼  0. 25 over the NCP to ∼  0. 46 over the Pacific south of Japan...|$|R

However, there have been limited observations <b>of</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> over this region. Over the Middle East, TES observations reveal abundances <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> between 60 and 100 ppbv, with amounts over 80 ppbv typically occurring between 300 and 450 hPa, whereas over India, enhanced ozone abundances are near 300 hPa. Over central Asia, observed ozone amounts are 150 - 200 ppbv at altitudes near 300 hPa.

These measurements will constitute a dynamical climatology of the stratosphere covering time scales ranging from diurnal to interannual. In addition, the SWIRLS investigation will quantify the physical mechanisms responsible for the structure and variations of stratospheric circulation and temperature fields, including the transport <b>of</b> species, particularly <b>ozone,</b> heat and momentum. Existing data sets lack the combination of accuracy, global and temporal coverage, spatial resoultion and simultaneity required to distinguish unambiguosly between the roles of dynamical and chemical processes in determining the current <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and its evolution in the future. The measurement objectives, measurement approach, and instrumentation of SWIRLS is described...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to measure regional <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations {{in a short time}} for understanding a mechanism of photo-chemical smog development. An airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) system with two low-power mini-TEA CO 2 lasers was developed for measuring three-dimensional <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in the lower troposphere. The CO 2 DIAL is a nadir-looking system and is designed to measure ozone profiles between ground and airplane by using atmospheric aerosols as a distributed radar target. First flight test with a single laser were conducted in February 1985 over the Tokyo area. The system was operated at an altitude of 5000 ft. Results of the first flight tests show that the height profiles of the received power in the boundary layer were different between over land and ocean. The received power has to be inverted to an expression of a single optical parameter to see real aerosol <b>distributions.</b> Inversion <b>of</b> the lidar signal to the aerosol extinction was performed by using Klett's solution...|$|R
