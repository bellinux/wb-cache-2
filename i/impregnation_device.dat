The basic principles behind the thermoplastic impregnation process are investigated and the properties needed for a successful thermoplastic <b>impregnation</b> <b>device</b> are formulated. All findings, both by experiments and modeling, are incorporated in the 'Integrated Rollerbox', which has actually been built.

40|$|The {{impregnation}} of reinforcing fibers for {{composite materials}} involves the pressure-driven {{flow of the}} impregnating fluid (resin) through a porous medium. For any practical <b>impregnation</b> <b>device,</b> the impregnation is affected by factors such as: {{the pressure of the}} resin that comes in contact with the fibers, the time this pressure is applied (contact time) and the length of the pressure zone. Most continuous impregnation devices for fiber rovings involve the principle of dynamic viscous pressurization in a wedge-type geometry. As an initial step towards the development of a novel impregnation process, a special device was designed to drag an impermeable tape and an accompanying fluid between two symmetric stationary surfaces. The pressure development in the gap was investigated theoretically and experimentally as a function of various geometric and operating parameters. For the Newtonian fluids used in the exploratory experiments, good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results was found for the maximum pressure. The downstream pressure drop was found to be slower than predicted, a finding which would be helpful in the case of fiber impregnation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Information on the {{influence}} of impregnation of cementitious slurry at the soil-structure interface of bored cast in-situ foundation is inadequate in available literatures. Moreover, influence of such impregnation on negating the detrimental effects of smear zone, formed by construction tools, surrounding the borehole is also unknown. In classical foundation engineering, influences of smear and impregnation are neither considered as dependent functions in determining contributory or negative shaft resistances, nor in shaft and base resistance interaction. This ignorance contributes empiricism in bearing capacity evaluation recognising it as one of the possible causes of variation of field performance with respect to prediction. Solution to these problems has been explored through field and simulated laboratory studies of smear and <b>impregnation,</b> developing new <b>device</b> and technique. Further, an approach to interface modelling of soil-structure is presented considering impregnation. ...|$|R
40|$|Porous ceramic marterials under {{conditions}} of high temperatures were studied. The aim is to study electrical and mass transfer processes in porous ceramic materials at high temperatures and temperature gradients. The model methods of calculation of effective transfer coefficients in grain porous media were developed. A description of condensation dynamics in porous body of a diffusible gas in the temperature gradient was given. A percolation model of electric conductivity of high-temperature solid oxide impurity electrolytes was proposed. The obtained results {{should be taken into}} account when studying processes of porous media <b>impregnation,</b> designing high-temperature <b>devices</b> with permeable walls, for evaluations of coefficients of transfer of ceramic materials. The obtained results are recommended for application in the Institute of High Temperatures of the Academy of Sciences, Institute of Electrodyamics of the Ukraine, Institute of Electrodynamics after FrumkinAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
