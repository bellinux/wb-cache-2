Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

5|$|The Duma {{approved}} {{construction in}} May 1912, before the design was finalised, and allocated 45.5 million rubles for each ship.

Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the New Admiralty Shipyard and the Baltic Works. The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916 and the second pair on 14 September 1916.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. <b>Diverted</b> <b>from</b> their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance.

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> its normal route.|$|E

This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

When the line was electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB).

An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded {{more than he had}} hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{consolidated}} their conquests into crusader states. During the 12th and 13th centuries, {{there were}} a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding Islamic states. Appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades, such as the Third Crusade, called to try to regain Jerusalem, which had been captured by Saladin (d. 1193) in 1187. In 1203, the Fourth Crusade was <b>diverted</b> <b>from</b> the Holy Land to Constantinople, and captured the city in 1204, setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261, but never regained their former strength. By 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland, although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived {{on the island of}} Cyprus for several years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, {{one of each}} aborting with mechanical problems.

Two D3As from Hiryū were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.|$|E
