25|$|The {{edges of}} a {{hypergraph}} may form an arbitrary <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> so the line graph of a hypergraph {{is the same}} as the intersection graph of the sets from the family.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> that {{satisfies}} (2–4) {{is called}} a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U {{is called a}}n ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

25|$|One can {{represent}} any partial order as a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> such that x < y in the partial order whenever the set corresponding to x is {{a subset of}} the set corresponding to y. In this way, comparability graphs can be shown to be equivalent to containment graphs of set families; that is, a graph with a vertex for each set in the family and an edge between two sets whenever one is {{a subset of the}} other.|$|E
25|$|The {{intersection}} {{of two or}} more matroids is the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> that are simultaneously independent in each of the matroids. The problem of finding the largest set, or the maximum weighted set, in the {{intersection of}} two matroids can be found in polynomial time, and provides a solution to many other important combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, maximum matching in bipartite graphs can be expressed as a problem of intersecting two partition matroids. However, finding the largest set in an intersection of three or more matroids is NP-complete.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} empty subset of a topological space {{is covered by}} the empty <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b> The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a {{terminal}} object, and consequently {{the value of a}} sheaf on the empty set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are in the category of sets, applying the local identity axiom to the empty family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom to the empty family shows that {{there is at least one}} section. This property is called the normalisation axiom.|$|E

25|$|The {{matching}} {{complex of}} a graph {{consists of the}} sets of edges no two of which share an endpoint; again, this <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> satisfies the no-Δ condition. It {{may be viewed as}} the clique complex of the complement graph of the line graph of the given graph. When the matching complex is referred to without any particular graph as context, it means the matching complex of a complete graph. The matching complex of a complete bipartite graph K'm,n is known as a chessboard complex. It is the clique graph of the complement graph of a rook's graph, and each of its simplices represents a placement of rooks on an m'n chess board such that no two of the rooks attack each other. When m=n±1, the chessboard complex forms a pseudo-manifold.|$|E
25|$|The clique complex X(G) of an {{undirected graph}} G is an {{abstract}} simplicial complex (that is, {{a family of}} finite sets closed under the operation of taking subsets), formed by the sets of vertices in the cliques of G. Any subset of a clique is itself a clique, so this <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> meets the requirement of an abstract simplicial complex that every subset of a set in the family should also be in the family. The clique complex can also {{be viewed as a}} topological space in which each clique of k vertices is represented by a simplex of dimension k1. The 1-skeleton of X(G) (also known as the underlying graph of the complex) is an undirected graph with a vertex for every 1-element set in the family and an edge for every 2-element set in the family; it is isomorphic toG.|$|E
25|$|For every {{feasible}} set S in the antimatroid, {{and every}} element x of S, one {{may find a}} path subset of S for which x is an endpoint: to do so, remove {{one at a time}} elements other than x until no such removal leaves a feasible subset. Therefore, each feasible set in an antimatroid is the union of its path subsets. If S is not a path, each subset in this union is a proper subset of S. But, if S is itself a path with endpoint x, each proper subset of S that belongs to the antimatroid excludes x. Therefore, the paths of an antimatroid are exactly the sets that do not equal the unions of their proper subsets in the antimatroid. Equivalently, a given <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> P forms the set of paths of an antimatroid if and only if, for each S in P, the union of subsets of S in P has one fewer element than S itself. If so, F itself is the family of unions of subsets of P.|$|E

40|$|Describing the {{elementary}} theories of Rogers semilattices {{is one of}} the main problems of the theory of numberings.

Nevertheless, the study of Rogers semilattices undertaken in recent years (see [2]–[5]) for <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> at levels greater than one in the Kleene-Mostowsky hierarchy has shown • significative differences as regards algebraic and elementary properties of these semilattices compared with the classical case; • homogeneity of the structure of their ideals and intervals. This initially seemed to lead to conjecture that the Rogers semilattices for infinite <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> any fixed high level of the arithmetical hierarchy have similar properties.

2500|$|Motivated by {{a problem}} of {{defining}} partial orders on {{the elements of a}} Coxeter group, [...] studied antimatroids which are also supersolvable lattices. A supersolvable antimatroid is defined by a totally ordered collection of elements, and a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> of these elements. The family must include the empty set.
