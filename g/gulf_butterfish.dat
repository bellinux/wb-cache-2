5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50â€“60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), <b>Gulf</b> <b>butterfish</b> (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
25|$|In November 1984, Chapman {{moved to}} her new home port at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and for the {{remainder}} of her NOAA career she was devoted exclusively to supporting the Pascagoula Laboratory at NMFSs Southeast Fisheries Science Center, operating in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and western Atlantic Ocean. Her first assignment was to explore the fishery potential of underutilized stocks of <b>Gulf</b> <b>butterfish,</b> squid, and coastal herring. In work closely connected with the emerging field of satellite imagery data acquisition and its application in fisheries science, she located commercially valuable concentrations of these species and characterized and monitored their populations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gulf</b> <b>butterfish</b> {{is highly}} esteemed for food. It is marketed fresh or frozen, and caught mainly with otter trawls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gulf</b> <b>butterfish</b> mature {{within one}} year and rarely live past two years; {{spawning}} takes place at discrete intervals twice a year slightly offshore.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gulf</b> <b>butterfish,</b> Peprilus burti, is a {{fish species}} of the family Stromateidae found in the Gulf of Mexico and {{off the coast of}} the Eastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gulf</b> <b>butterfish</b> inhabits the Western Atlantic Ocean, {{including}} the entire Gulf of Mexico from the Tampa region in Florida, USA to Yucatan in Mexico. It also occurs {{on the eastern}} seaboard from Virginia to northeastern Florida, USA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gulf</b> <b>butterfish</b> form large loose {{schools across}} the {{continental}} shelf over sand/mud bottoms; depth ranges from 2 to 275 m at least, but are most abundant at 155 to 225 m. They are found near the bottom during the day, and migrate into the water column at night. Juveniles are often found under floating weeds and with jellyfish.|$|E
