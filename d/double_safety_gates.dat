5000|$|In {{the event}} of a hazard, the task of safety {{functions}} (e.g. E-STOP, <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> or standstill monitoring) is to use appropriate measures to reduce the existing risk to an acceptable level. These many safety functions include: ...|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} {{problems}} presented by the rational determination of the reduction mode in the traditional strength reduction method and to overcome the difficulty in determining <b>double</b> <b>safety</b> factors from the existing double reduction factors method, a nonproportional relationship between the cohesion reduction factor and the internal friction angle reduction factor is established for {{a case in which}} the strength parameter distribution obeys the linear attenuation assumption. By introducing this correlation into the traditional strength reduction finite element method, the nonproportional correlative reduction finite element method for slope strength parameters is proposed. To verify the reliability of the proposed method, the nonproportional correlation is introduced into Bishop’s slice method, yielding the nonproportional <b>double</b> <b>safety</b> factors of Bishop’s slice method. For the whole safety storage of the slope based on the <b>double</b> <b>safety</b> factors, a comprehensive safety factor with the contribution of the shear strength parameter to the sliding resistance force as weight is proposed. Finally, in combination with an example and a comparative analysis of the slope sliding surface positions and the comprehensive safety factors for three different types of reduction modes with two types of methods, the rationality and reliability of this method were validated...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Munchkin, Inc. {{expanded}} to Europe through {{the acquisition of}} Lindam Limited, a safety brand for babies in the U.K. First, the transaction provided a substantial footprint in Europe growing international distribution of its existing portfolio. Second, it allowed Munchkin to quickly enter the large U.S. infant <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> category with an award winning European line.|$|R
50|$|The current railway {{crossing}} at Gilchrest Road West is now protected with crossbucks, flashing lights, a warning bell and <b>safety</b> <b>gates.</b> Frequent freight trains are operated there by CSX Transportation. This accident helped {{change the law}} requiring school buses to stop, open their bus door and listen for a specific amount of time before crossing any railroad track.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 stop planks and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> were {{installed}} in the Regent's Canal and in the Grand Union Canal in Greater London area and its Slough branch. Stop plank grooves were cut {{at each end of}} the aqueducts and at all weir sluices, whilst the stop gates were built in such a way that they did not unduly obstruct canal traffic.|$|R

Express trains pass through the station at high speeds, requiring the platforms to be secured by <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> with warning signs. The border crossing building stands empty and exposed to vandalism. The station building, which was also empty, was demolished in 2012.|$|R
50|$|A baby <b>gate</b> {{or child}} <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> is a {{protective}} barrier {{designed to prevent}} babies and toddlers from accessing areas of a home where they might be unsafe, such as stairways and kitchens. Baby gates are typically constructed of metal, plastic and/or wood, and can be expanded to fit {{in a range of}} doorway widths. They may be designed for use indoors or out, and may be either hardware or pressure-mounted.|$|R
50|$|The 2 x 640 kW {{power of}} the main drive and the 54 mm {{diameter}} solid cable wire {{is among the most}} powerful and strongest monocable gondola installation in the world.

50|$|A web {{application}} firewall (or WAF) filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic {{to and from}} a {{web application}}. A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> between servers. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations.|$|R
50|$|The new monocable gondola lift {{built by}} Leitner Ropeways uses 60 mm {{diameter}} solid cable wire ropes {{as opposed to}} Genting Skyway's 54 mm diameter solid cable wire ropes. Likewise, {{they are among the}} strongest monocable gondola installations in the world. Similarly, it is equipped with high-tech electronic equipment and was built in accordance with stringent Swiss regulations. It also has a <b>double</b> <b>safety</b> circuit which is completely independent.|$|R
50|$|Canal <b>Safety</b> <b>Gates</b> or Canal Air Raid Protection Gates are {{structures}} that were installed on canals specifically {{to reduce or}} prevent flood damage to dwellings, factories, etc. {{in the event of}} aqueducts, canal banks, etc. being breached either through natural events or by enemy action during wars, insurgency, sabotage, etc. They sometimes have a secondary function in regard of canal maintenance work. Substantial structures or simple 'Stop Gates' or 'Stop Planks' were used to prevent flooding and were usually only put in place when air raid warnings were given.|$|R
50|$|If a {{passenger}} fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or {{pass through a}} light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the <b>safety</b> <b>gate,</b> and initiate the lift restart procedure. While possibly annoying to other passengers on the chairlift, it is preferable to strike the safety gate—that is, {{it should not be}} avoided—and stop the lift than be an unexpected downhill passenger. Many lifts are limited in their download capacity; others can transport passengers at 100 percent capacity in either direction.|$|R
50|$|The M830 is an American high {{explosive}} anti-tank (HEAT) round meant {{primarily for the}} 120 mm M256 main gun of the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams. Aside from the <b>double</b> <b>safety,</b> propellant containment bag and M764 fuze, it {{is identical to the}} German DM12A1. The cartridge weighs approximately 53.4 lb (24.2 kg). The round was praised for its performance during the 1991 Gulf War. It is no longer manufactured and has been replaced by the M830A1.|$|R
40|$|Foreigners {{coming to}} the {{south-western}} coast of India have produced seemingly contrasting statements in the past regarding the existence of territories there. Two examples may serve as illustrations. Ibn Battûta, who travelled throughout this coast in the 1340 s, states: There are in Malabar twelve idolatrous sultans…. Between the States of each of them, there is a wooden gate on which is engraved {{the name of the}} one whose domain starts from this point. It is called the <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> of "N". When after some offence a Muslim or an idolatrous has fled the State of one of these princes, and has reached the <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> of another prince, he is in security, and the one he flees cannot seize him even though he be powerful and heading numerous armies. (Ibn Battûta 1982 : III- 197 - my translation from the French version). In contrast, Van Reede, the first Dutch Governor in Cochin, writes in 1677 : The extent of each realm is expressed {{in terms of the number}} of soldiers the Chief could command- the territorial extent not being taken into consideration. Of course there are traditional boundaries for each Nad [principality] over which the individual chieftains held sway. (Van Reede, quoted by Raman Menon 1936 : 12). Thus, on the one hand sacrosanct boundaries marked by gates are mentioned, while, o...|$|R
50|$|The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal is 17 {{miles long}} canal, up to 5 metres in depth {{so that in}} the event of a canal breach {{millions}} of litres of water would flood the area. A series of <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> are located along the canal and are particularly important as an unusual feature of the canal is a lack of locks, being described as a contour canal. In an emergency these gates automatically close to ensure that any risk created by a flood is controlled, protecting Gloucester and the villages along the course of the canal to Sharpness.|$|R
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. On this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, <b>safety</b> <b>gates,</b> and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|R
50|$|Baby on the Move sells {{a variety}} of baby safety equipment, {{including}} car seats and restraints for infants. Other products include portable cots, flat folding baths, stainless steel baby bottles, buggies, bassinets, infant capsules with bases, exersaucers, toddler seats, cots, monitors, and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> for doorways. Some of the products can be rented, while the remaining are available only for purchase. They also conduct inspections to check whether the already existing child restraints are safe or not. Baby on the Move staff and franchisees have 'safe to go' accreditation which allows them to lawfully install a child seat to comply with New Zealand law and safety guidelines.|$|R
50|$|Malfunctioning {{of control}} systems {{can lead to}} {{unacceptable}} risk, jeopardizing both capital investments and people. To eliminate such risks as far as possible, the relevant control systems must meet exacting requirements in terms of functional safety. These requirements can {{include the use of}} <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> switches or trapped key interlock systems. The standard EN/IEC 954-1 (Safety of machinery, Safety related parts of control systems, Part 1: General principles for design) has been replaced by EN/ISO13849-1 (Safety of machinery, Safetyrelated parts of control systems, Part 1: General principles for design) and EN/IEC 62061 (Safety of machinery, Functional safety of safety related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems).|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>gates</b> {{are used}} to help prevent a child from {{accessing}} an area of a house, especially the stairway, or to allow an exterior door to be open for ventilation while restricting movement of a child. Pressure gates and hardware mounted gates are available. Pressure gates can be dislodged by children {{and should not be}} used at the top of stairs. In some situations, pressure gates at the top of stairs have caused serious injury when a child has run against it or when a parent has fallen trying to step over the gate. Hardware mounted gates are the most secure option and should be installed securely into wall studs.|$|R
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|R
50|$|Large {{volumes of}} stored water have {{considerable}} destructive potential and where {{structures such as}} canals run on embankments above low lying built up areas or where aqueducts exist, appropriate safety precautions were taken either as a war time contingency or {{at the time of}} construction. These 'Canal Safety Gates' or 'Canal Air Raid Protection Gates (ARPG)' were constructed and installed in regard to the scale of the danger posed and ranged from simple wooden planks known as 'Stop Gates' or 'Stop Planks' to more massive constructions built of concrete and steel such as the <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> built on the Forth and Clyde Canal near Stockingfield Junction and on the Glasgow Branch at Firhill Road and Craighall Road.|$|R

50|$|Another {{criticism}} is that gated communities offer {{a false sense}} of security. Some studies indicate that <b>safety</b> in <b>gated</b> communities may be more illusion than reality and that gated communities in suburban areas of the United States have no less crime than similar non-gated neighborhoods.|$|R
50|$|The {{total length}} of the dug main canals is 929 km, {{including}} new and old canals and streams which were completely or partially reconstructed and thus included in the new system. In the basic canal network there are 51 structures - 24 gates, 16 locks, five <b>safety</b> <b>gates,</b> six pumping stations, and 180 bridges. There are 14 cargo ports on the canals. On the new canals of the Danube-Tisa-Danube water system, 84 bridges were built - 62 carriageway, 19 railway and 3 pedestrian bridges. One {{of the most important}} structures within this water system is the dam on the river Tisa near Novi Bečej which regulates the water regime in the basic canal network in Banat, for irrigation of about 3,000 km².|$|R
