5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (<b>hunting</b> <b>ban)</b> was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, puffin numbers {{increased}} considerably {{in the late}} twentieth century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, a slight increase on the 2008 census and on the previous year's poor season when some of the burrows flooded. This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic puffin being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further <b>hunting</b> <b>ban</b> covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969-2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, it is estimated that the European population will decline by 50-79% between 2000 and 2065.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{since the}} {{introduction}} of the <b>hunting</b> <b>ban,</b> a number of hunts have employed falconers to bring birds of prey to the hunt, due to the exemption in the Hunting Act for falconry. Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1950s, when Brooks Camp was opened, {{there were}} fewer bears at the falls than there are today, {{and no more than}} 6-7 bears could be {{observed}} at one time. Now, with <b>hunting</b> <b>banned</b> and viewing controlled, bear numbers have boomed to quadruple their former number. In the early days, since hunting was allowed, bear numbers were lower and salmon and sport fishing was the primary attraction to the falls.|$|R

50|$|In 1982, MARENA {{established}} seasonal <b>hunting</b> <b>bans</b> for 26 {{endangered species}} of mammals and 4 species of reptiles. This was {{in response to}} Nicaragua being a world leader in the export of rare and endangered species such as White-lipped peccaries, White-tailed deer, hawksbill turtles, freshwater otters, jaguars, ocelots, and margays. Educational campaigns were initiated by MARENA, along with marketplace and roadside inspections. By 1985, however, many of these bans were lifted because of the growing economic crisis in the country.|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{include several}} species of antelope, such as Soemmerring’s gazelle and Pelzeln’s gazelle. As {{a result of the}} <b>hunting</b> <b>ban</b> imposed since early 1970 these species are well conserved now. Other {{characteristic}} mammals are Grevy’s zebra, hamadryas baboon and Hunter's antelope. The warthog, a vulnerable species, is also found in the Day National park. The coastal waters have dugongs and Abyssinian genet; the latter needs confirmation by further studies. Green turtles and hawksbill turtles are in the coastal waters where nestling also takes place. The Northeast African cheetah Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii are thought to be extinct in Djibouti. However, there are refuges where the cheetahs are breeding.|$|E
25|$|Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which {{involves}} dragging an object {{over the ground}} to lay a scent for the hounds to follow, can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while the hounds pick up a scent, and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt, which may even necessitate a change of horses halfway through. A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District. Since the UK <b>hunting</b> <b>ban,</b> hunts are using a mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil {{in order to improve}} the persistence of the scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20minutes in advance of the hunt. Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{scientific}} evidence that fox hunting {{has no effect on}} fox populations, at least in Britain, thereby calling into question the idea it is a successful method of culling. In 2001 there was a 1-year nationwide ban on fox-hunting because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. [...] It was found this ban on hunting had no measurable impact on fox numbers in randomly selected areas. [...] Prior to the fox <b>hunting</b> <b>ban</b> in the UK, hounds contributed to the deaths of 6.3% of the 400,000 foxes killed annually.|$|E

The conservation role of the industry is also hindered by governments and hunting operators that fail to devolve adequate benefits to local communities, reducing incentives for them to protect wildlife, and by unethical activities, such as shooting from vehicles and canned hunting, conducted by some operators which attract negative press and foster support for <b>hunting</b> <b>bans.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} wolves and other predators has {{increased}} slightly in reindeer pastures and habitats. This {{has resulted in}} a decrease of reindeer numbers closer to the hypothetical number of wild forest reindeer, and in a slight increase of lichens. Wolves and other predators have increased because of <b>hunting</b> <b>bans.</b> Wandering great beasts strengthen the gene pool of a wider area but this serves the general targets of Green Belt and ecological corridor only partially, and the exchange of genes between Finnish and Russian wolf populations has not increased.|$|R
2500|$|The Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement, agreed {{by the new}} {{government}} following the 2010 general election aimed to give MPs a free vote [...] "to express its view" [...] on repealing the Hunting Act 2004 when parliamentary time allowed, possibly in 'early 2012'. The prime minister explained in January 2012 [...] "I always thought the <b>hunting</b> <b>ban</b> was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I {{think there should be}} a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this. My problem has always been that it was just taking the criminal law into an area of activity where it didn’t really belong." [...] However, in December 2012 Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said that there was no immediate likelihood of winning a Commons vote to make hunting legal again and that supporters of hunting would need to do [...] "more work" [...] to win over sceptical MPs.|$|E
2500|$|In what he {{described}} as an attempt to raise animal welfare standards at the same time, and as an alternative to legislation that specifically targeted hunting, Lord Donoughue proposed the Wild Mammals (Protection) (Amendment) Bill. This would have made it the case that [...] "any person who intentionally inflicts, or causes or procures, unnecessary suffering on or to any wild mammal shall be guilty of an offence." [...] A matching Bill was introduced in the Commons with the support of The Middle Way Group (see below). [...] Both bills failed to become law as they were blocked by Labour members who wanted a specific <b>hunting</b> <b>ban.</b> Animal welfare groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports criticised the Bill on two grounds. Firstly, they opposed the exemption in the Bill for activities undertaken [...] "in accordance with an approved code of conduct". Secondly, they argued that, if an activity was inherently cruel, it should be deemed as such by Parliament, rather than prosecutors having to argue and prove cruelty in every court case.|$|E

States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals, as designated by law.

5000|$|The {{group have}} {{actively}} campaigned against the fur trade, animal experimentation, greyhound racing, zoos, animal farms, live exports, {{and other forms}} of animal use. They are currently in alliance with a younger Irish animal rights group, National Animal Rights Association (NARA) http://www.naracampaigns.org/ in a renewed campaign against live exports to Libya and other European and African countries. This focus was prompted by the resumption of live exports from Ireland to Libya after a 17-year gap.According to Dublin's Vegan Animal Rights Bulletin, AFAR and NARA have organised a vigil at an Irish port involved in live exports, a demonstration outside of the offices of a live export company, and a [...] "home demonstration" [...] at the house of the company's owner.On the political front, AFAR, working closely with the Association of Hunt Saboteurs and others, were instrumental in the banning of the Ward Union Stag Hunt in 2010, and supported the Irish Green Party during its terms as a coalition partner in government in Ireland (2007-2011).
