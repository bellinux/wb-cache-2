5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded <b>filter</b> <b>performance.</b> Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the <b>filter</b> <b>performance</b> by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

The high input impedance and gain of an op-amp allow straightforward calculation of element values, allowing accurate implementation of any desired filter topology with little concern for the loading effects of stages in the filter or of subsequent stages. However, the frequencies at which active filters can be implemented is limited; when the behavior of the amplifiers departs significantly from the ideal behavior assumed in elementary design of the filters, <b>filter</b> <b>performance</b> is degraded.|$|E
40|$|A novel noise {{filtering}} algorithm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is proposed to remove artifacts in electrocardiogram (ECG) traces.

30|$|Given the {{inherited}} mud pulse telemetry complexity {{with the}} working interaction surroundings, surface signal processing and noise cancellation methods {{are limited by}} certain assumptions and simplifications. Numerous researches provided contradicting details related to signal generation, signal transmission data rates, signal detection and extraction.

On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E
25|$|Side-Stream Filtration — Side-stream filtration, {{although}} {{popular and}} effective, {{does not provide}} complete protection. With side-stream filtration, {{a portion of the}} water is filtered continuously. This method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean. Manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid, complete with a pump and controls. For high flow systems, this method is cost-effective. Properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory <b>filter</b> <b>performance,</b> but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system. Many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10% of the total circulation flow rate. For example, if the total flow of a system is 1,200 gal/min (a 400-ton system), a 120 gal/min side-stream system is specified.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures <b>filter</b> <b>performance.</b> Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E
40|$|The aim in {{information}} filtering {{is to provide}} users with a personalised selection of information, based on their interest profile. In adaptive information filtering, this profile partially or completely acquired by automatic means. This paper investigates if profile generation can be partially acquired by automatic methods and partially by direct user involvement. The issue is explored through an empirical study of a simulated filtering system that mixes automatic and manual profile generation. The study covers several issues involved in mixed control. The first issue concerns if a machine-learned profile can provide better <b>filtering</b> <b>performance</b> if generated from an initial explicit user profile. The second issue concerns if user involvement can improve on a system-generated or adapted profile. Finally, the relationship between <b>filtering</b> <b>performance</b> and user ratings is investigated. In this particular study the initial setup of a personal profile was effective and yielded performance improvements that persisted after substantiate training. However, the study showed no correlation between users’ ratings of profiles and profile <b>filtering</b> <b>performance,</b> and only weak indications that users could improve profiles that already had been trained on feedback...|$|R
40|$|Commonly used data-dependent spatial filters {{depend on}} the {{acoustic}} transfer functions and the power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the desired and the undesired signals. Assuming a low-rank model of the spatial PSD matrix of the signals, and a particular spatial <b>filter,</b> the <b>performance</b> {{in terms of a}} given objective measure can often be described analytically. In this paper, we propose to use the similarity between the desired and undesired signal subspaces obtained from the sample spatial PSD matrices, as an indicator of the achievable spatial <b>filtering</b> <b>performance.</b> The subspace similarity is expressed as a distance function on the Grassmann manifold, computed using the principal angles between the subspaces.

500|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>performance</b> parameters, such as {{stopband}} {{rejection and}} rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing {{the length of the}} filter. [...] Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an image parameter filter design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. [...] This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle-iron filter. [...] For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and Butterworth filters. [...] In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. [...] Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. [...] In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. [...] Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{requirements of}} the fifth generation (5 G) wireless communications are high spectral efficiency, low latency, and ubiquitous coverage. In this direction, Dual-Hop (DH) Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relaying has been widely investigated due to its simplicity, low implementation complexity and low transmission delay. However, most existing works assume ideal transceiver hardware which is impractical. In practice, a cost-efficient wireless transceiver has to combat the effects of several inevitable impairments such as high power amplifier nonlinearities, In-phase/Quadrature-phase (I/Q) -imbalance, and oscillator phase noise, which can be only partially compensated using calibration algorithms. In this direction, this paper analyzes the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) <b>filtering</b> <b>performance</b> of a DH-AF Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system considering {{the effects of the}} residual additive impairments at the transmitter and receiver of both hops. Using free probability principles, the MMSE <b>filtering</b> <b>performance</b> of the considered system is studied and a tight lower bound is proposed by taking the effects of residual additive transceiver impairments into account. Our numerical results show that the MMSE <b>filtering</b> <b>performance</b> of the DH-AF massive MIMO relay system significantly degrades and results to saturation in the presence of residual additive transceiver impairments...|$|R

Theoretically, a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled at the Nyquist rate or above it.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the adaptive median post-filter to improve impedance estima-tion based on the differential equation algorithm. The main feature of the post-filter is the automatic selection of the optimal window size that balances between fast track-ing and <b>filtering</b> <b>performance.</b> For sudden impedance change (fault inception), small window size is selected to make fault detection fast. Large window size is selected if the impedance is slow varying or steady-state (pre-fault and fault conditions) to increase filtering efficiency. The post-filter is also very efficient in eliminating impulsive noise created by numerical instability of the differential equation algorithm under certain conditions.

A parameter called classification homogeneity is presented for analyzing unsupervised automated classification by employing human classification as a control. Two significant components of the automated classification approach, vocabulary discovery and classification scheme generation, are described in detail. Results of classification performance revealed considerable variability in the homogeneity of automatically produced classes. Based on the classification performance, different types of interest profiles were created. Subsequently, these profiles were used to perform filtering sessions.
