5|$|Aetosaur fossils {{have been}} <b>found</b> on all continents except Australia and Antarctica, {{giving them a}} nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late Triassic. Many aetosaur remains have been <b>found</b> from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils have been <b>found</b> from Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been <b>found</b> from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They have been <b>found</b> from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been <b>found</b> from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late Triassic, Morocco {{would have been in}} close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It is also possible that Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils have been <b>found</b> from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} <b>found</b> {{that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was <b>found</b> not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC <b>found</b> that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC <b>found</b> that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC <b>found</b> that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also <b>found</b> to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
