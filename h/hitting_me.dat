500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the season was Tanner Gill. In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying [...] "I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That {{has to be very}} believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they <b>hitting</b> <b>me,</b> so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.|$|E
2500|$|During the Centenary Test, Randall scored 174 at Melbourne, {{against an}} Australian attack led by Dennis Lillee. He famously doffed his cap to Lillee, after {{narrowly}} evading a savage bouncer, stating, [...] "No point in <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> there, mate, there's nothing in it." [...] When finally dismissed {{he left the}} ground by the wrong gate, and found himself climbing up towards the Royal enclosure where Queen Elizabeth II was watching the day's play. [...] "She was very nice about it," [...] he told the BBC. [...] "She smiled. Someone else quickly put me right." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 2006, his {{official}} website {{announced that he}} had signed with Jive Records in a deal worth $1.5 million. He also announced for the first time an album to be called The Nacirema Dream ("American" [...] spelled backwards) was in the planning. However, in September 2007, DJ Kay Slay revealed that he and Papoose had left Jive, commenting that they had [...] "almost [...] victims of A hell." [...] This was due to Jive wanting Papoose to be a more commercial artist. He would say, [...] "The business part and the politics of the game kinda got in the way. A lot of people were <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> with ideas about doing this and that and got in the way. I can't really blame them, I blame myself for letting it happen." [...] In December 2009 DJ Kay Slay would confirm the album was still coming.|$|E
5000|$|An {{advertising}} campaign during the 1990s included the slogan [...] "Hit {{me with a}} Samboy chip", with the television commercial featuring a variety of Australian celebrities furthering the slogan to [...] "hit <b>me</b> slowly, <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> quick, <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> baby one more time", imitating the song <b>Hit</b> <b>Me</b> With Your Rhythm Stick by Ian Dury & The Blockheads.|$|R
5000|$|She {{tried to}} <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> two times, I am {{a master of}} martial arts, and both times I {{took her by the}} hair and back, and I put her on her knees ... Both times I immobilized her when she tried to <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> but she never <b>hit</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Serbian {{was praised}} by Dave Lombardo of Slayer, {{who said that}} [...] "There's a band called The Locust. Their drummer is named Gabe Serbian, and their music <b>hits</b> <b>me</b> now like D.R.I. <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> in the early '80s".|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, of course, it's my fault. Everything's {{always my}} fault," [...] said Grimes. [...] "Now don't go to <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> again" [...] (for the {{truncheon}} started upright, and looked very wicked); [...] "you know, if my arms were only free, you daren't <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> then." ...|$|R

500|$|When someone punches you so {{much and}} so hard, {{it feels as if}} your face is broken. People <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> on my back and on my sides with their hands and then kicked me.... they psychologically {{tortured}} me; they didn't <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> but they made strong threats to kill me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{an account}} to settle with your brother," [...] went on Belright Fogg, rather maliciously. [...] "He took great {{pleasure}} {{the other day}} in <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> {{in the head with a}} snowball, almost knocking me senseless. I've had to have my head treated by a doctor, and more than likely I'll sue him for damages." ...|$|E
60|$|The remark {{was entirely}} {{uncalled}} for, {{and it made}} me angry. Hot words passed; and he was on the point of <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> when my uncle came in and stopped the row.

6000|$|... "You've got a swell {{chance to}} make this team, you have, not! Third base is my job, Freshie. Why, you tow-head, you couldn't play marbles. You butter-finger, can't you stop anything? You can't even play sub on this team. Remember, Ward, I said I'd get you for <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> that day. You hit me with a potato once, too. I'll chase you off this team." ...|$|E

You took me entirely by surprise; but that's all in the past--I'm willing to let bygones be bygones, and help {{you out of the}} pretty pickle you've got yourself into. Then we can go ahead with our work as though nothing had happened. What do you say?" ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this I made {{an effort}} to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> a tap on the {{forehead}} with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the meantime, he continued his talk.|$|E

I, can I join myself to that set? If I bite you, as you complain, it is without my knowledge.

6000|$|... "What {{do you say}} to my {{swimming}} off to her, as soon as it gets quite dark, captain?" [...] Bob said. [...] "I am a {{very good}} swimmer. We used to bathe regularly at Putney, where I was at school; and I have swum across the Thames and back, lots of times. There is sure to be a little mist on the water, presently, and they won't be keeping a very sharp lookout till it gets later. I can get hold of a cable and climb up; and get in over the bow, if there is no lookout there, and see what is going on. There is no danger in the thing for, if I am discovered, I have only got to dive and swim back again. There is no current to speak of, here; and there wouldn't be the least chance of their <b>hitting</b> <b>me,</b> in the dark. I should certainly be able to learn something, by listening to their talk." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{first heard}} of her death from Minver at the club, and I heard with still greater astonishment that Alderling was down there alone where she had died. Minver said that {{somebody}} ought {{to go down and}} look after the poor old fellow, but nobody seemed to feel it exactly his office. Certainly I did not feel it mine, and I thought it rather a hardship when a few days after I found a letter from Alderling at the club quite piteously beseeching me to come to him. He had read of my arrival home, in a stray New York paper, and he was firing his letter, he said, at the club, with one chance in a thousand of <b>hitting</b> <b>me</b> with it. Rulledge was by when I read it, and he decided, with that unsparing activity of his, where other people are concerned, that I must go; I certainly could not resist such an appeal as that. He had a vague impression, he said, of something weird in the situation down there, and I ought to go and pull Alderling out of it; besides, I might find my account in it as a psychologist. I hesitated a day, out of self-respect, or self-assertion, and then, the weather coming on suddenly hot, in the beginning of September, I went.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} she swooped out of space, {{out of the}} infinite unknown, and hit me. She always hits me when she comes near me, and I infer she hits everyone she comes across. She hit me {{this time in the}} chest with her elbow and knocked me away from the door-handle. She hit me very hard; indeed, she was as fierce as I have ever known her. With her there were two nieces and a nephew, and the nephew hit me too. He was a horrid little boy in an Eton suit of the kind that they do not wear at Eton, and he hit me with his head and pushed at me with his little pink hands. The nieces might have been about twenty-two and thirteen respectively, and I infer that they were apprenticed to her. All four people seemed madly excited. [...] "It's just starting!" [...] they screamed, and the train was, indeed, slowly moving. Their object--so far as they had an object and were not animated by mere fury--appeared to be to assault me and then escape in the train. The lady in blue got in and then came backwards out again, sweeping the smaller girl behind her upon the two others, who were engaged in hustling me. [...] "It's 'smoking!'" [...] she cried. I could have told her that, if she had asked instead of <b>hitting</b> <b>me.</b> The elder girl, by backing dexterously upon me, knocked my umbrella out of my hand, and when I stooped to pick it up the little boy knocked my hat off. I will confess they demoralised me with their archaic violence. I had some thought of joining in their wild amuck, whooping, kicking out madly, perhaps assaulting a porter,--I think the lady in blue would have been surprised to find what an effective addition to her staff she had picked up,--but before I could collect my thoughts sufficiently to do any definite thing the whole affair was over. A porter was slamming doors on them, the train was running fast out of the station, and I was left alone with an unmannerly newsboy and an unmannerly porter on the platform. I waited until the porter was out of the way, and then I hit the newsboy for laughing at me, but even with that altercation it was a tedious wait for the next train to Wimbledon.|$|E
