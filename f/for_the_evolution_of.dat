5|$|Another model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> {{circular}} permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process {{starts with}} two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as {{two parts of}} a heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} model proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism. In this model, {{a precursor}} gene first undergoes a duplication and fusion {{to form a}} large tandem repeat. Next, start and stop codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing redundant sections of the protein.|$|E

5|$|A theory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> aposematism {{posits that}} it arises by {{reciprocal}} selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, {{which could be}} visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, {{and it is not}} contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish an explanation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales {{would have created}} different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be {{made possible by the}} much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|The large {{surface area}} and vascularization of the crest also {{suggests}} a thermoregulatory function. The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed {{that there was a}} nerve connection between the crest and the brain, so that the latter could be cooled by the former. The next people to publish a related idea were Maryanska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the crest.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model {{states that}} the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, {{the ratio of the}} number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported {{is that it}} allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack}} of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts {{the formation of a}} black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E

5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the giraffes {{is believed to have}} been the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> new species.|$|E
