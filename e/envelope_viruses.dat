25|$|A major {{branch of}} {{virology}} is virus classification. Viruses {{can be classified}} according to the host cell they infect: animal viruses, plant viruses, fungal viruses, and bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacterium, which include the most complex viruses). Another classification uses the geometrical shape of their capsid (often a helix or an icosahedron) or the virus's structure (e.g. {{presence or absence of}} a lipid <b>envelope).</b> <b>Viruses</b> range in size from about 30 nm to about 450 nm, which means that most of them cannot be seen with light microscopes. The shape and structure of viruses has been studied by electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} enveloped viruses can be {{extensively}} glycosylated. Unlike the glycans coating pathogens such as bacteria and fungi, glycans on viruses are added and processed by the host-cell during biosynthesis. Glycoproteins are typically subjected to α-mannosidase processing and Golgi-mediated glycosyltransferase extension to form complex-type glycans. In <b>envelope</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{exceptions to this}} default pathway are common and lead {{to the presence of}} oligomannose-type glycan structures on the virion surface. In one extreme example, HIV- 1 utilises a high density of glycans to limit host antibody recognition of protein. However, the high density limits glycan processing and the resulting oligomannose structures can be recognised by broadly neutralising antibodies isolated from HIV- 1 infected patients.

Targeting vectors pseudotyped with distinct viral envelope proteins that influence cell tropism and transfection efficiency are useful tools not only for examining entry mechanisms or cell tropisms but also for vaccine vector development. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an excellent candidate for development as a pseudotype vector. A recombinant VSV lacking its own envelope (G) gene {{has been used to}} produce a pseudotype or recombinant VSV possessing the envelope proteins of heterologous viruses. These viruses possess a reporter gene instead of a VSV G gene in their genome, and therefore it is easy to evaluate their infectivity in the study of viral entry, including identification of viral receptors. Furthermore, advantage can be taken of a property of the pseudotype VSV, which is competence for single-round infection, in handling many different viruses that are either difficult to amplify in cultured cells or animals or that require specialized containment facilities.

40|$|Viral {{envelope}} proteins mediate {{interactions with}} host cells, leading to internalization and intracellular propagation. Envelope proteins are glycosylated and {{are known to}} serve important functions in masking host immunity to viral glycoproteins. How-ever, the viral infectious cycle in cells may also lead to aberrant glycosylation that may elicit immunity. Our knowledge of immu-nity to aberrant viral glycans and glycoproteins is limited, potentially due to technical limitations in identifying immunogenic glycans and glycopeptide epitopes. This work describes three different complementary methods for high-throughput screening and identification of potential immunodominantO-glycopeptide epitopes on viral envelope glycoproteins: (i) on-chip enzymatic glycosylation of scan peptides, (ii) chemical glycopeptide microarray synthesis, and (iii) a one-bead-one-compound random gly-copeptide library. We used herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) as a model system and identified a simpleO-glycopeptide pan-epitope, 501 PPA(GalNAc) TAPG 507, on the mature gG- 2 glycoprotein that was broadly recognized by IgG antibodies in HSV- 2 -infected individuals but not in HSV- 1 -infected or noninfected individuals. Serum reactivity to the extended sialyl-T glycoform was tolerated, suggesting that self glycans can participate in immune responses. The methods presented provide new insight into viral immunity and new targets for immunodiagnostic and therapeutic measures. <b>Envelope</b> <b>viruses</b> encode one or more membrane proteins thatmediate specific binding to host cell ligands and direct early events of membrane fusion and internalization (32).

Previous studies on enveloped viruses {{have shown that}} many incorporated cellular proteins associated with the virion's membranes that might play important roles in viral infectivity. In this study, we sought to proteomically profile the cellular proteins incorporated into or associated with the virions of a highly virulent PRRSV strain GDBY 1, and to provide foundation for further investigations on the roles of incorporated/associated cellular proteins on PRRSV's infectivity. Results In our experiment, sixty one cellular proteins were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometric approaches. The identified cellular proteins could be grouped into eight functional categories including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, metabolism-associated proteins, calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins and other functional proteins. Among the identified proteins, four {{have not yet been}} reported in other studied <b>envelope</b> <b>viruses,</b> namely, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3 -monooxygenase/tryptophan 5 -monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin- 1 protein. The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i. e., β-actin, Tubulin, Annexin A 2, heat shock protein Hsp 27, and calcium binding proteins S 100) in the highly purified PRRSV virions was validated by Western blot and immunogold labeling assays. Conclusions Taken together, the present study has demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in PRRSV virions, which provides valuable information for the further investigations for the effects of individual cellular proteins on the viral replication, assembly, and pathogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe vacuolar (H+) -ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-dependent proton pumps {{responsible}} for both acidification of intracellular compartments and, for certain cell types, proton transport across the plasma membrane. Intracellular V-ATPases function in both endocytic and intracellular membrane traffic, processing and degradation of macromolecules in secretory and digestive compartments, coupled transport of small molecules such as neurotransmitters and ATP {{and in the}} entry of pathogenic agents, including <b>envelope</b> <b>viruses</b> and bacterial toxins. V-ATPases {{are present in the}} plasma membrane of renal cells, osteoclasts, macrophages, epididymal cells and certain tumor cells where they are important for urinary acidification, bone resorption, pH homeostasis, sperm maturation and tumor cell invasion, respectively. The V-ATPases are composed of a peripheral domain (V 1) that carries out ATP hydrolysis and an integral domain (V 0) {{responsible for}} proton transport. V 1 contains eight subunits (A–H) while V 0 contains six subunits (a, c, c′, c″, d and e). V-ATPases operate by a rotary mechanism in which ATP hydrolysis within V 1 drives rotation of a central rotary domain, that includes a ring of proteolipid subunits (c, c′ and c″), relative to the remainder of the complex. Rotation of the proteolipid ring relative to subunit a within V 0 drives active transport of protons across the membrane. Two important mechanisms of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo are reversible dissociation of the V 1 and V 0 domains and changes in coupling efficiency of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. This review focuses on recent advances in our lab in understanding the structure and regulation of the V-ATPases...|$|E

Pretreatment of HIV- 1 NL 4 - 3 with SLS decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, its infectivity when using 1 G 5 as target cells. In {{the absence of a}} viral pretreatment period or when 1 G 5 cells were pretreated with SLS, the surfactant-induced inactivation of viral infectivity was less pronounced, especially at concentrations between 375 and 550 mM. SLS had no effect on HIV- 1 when the virus was adsorbed to 1 G 5 cells by a 2 -h incubation period. SLS almost completely inhibited the fusion process by decreasing the attachment of HIV- 1 to target cells. SLS also inhibited the infectivity of HIV- 1 -based luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (which enters cells in a CD 4 -, CCR 5 -, and CXCR 4 -independent manner), indicating that SLS may inactivate other <b>envelope</b> <b>viruses.</b> In contrast, no effect was seen with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (which enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis) pretreated with up to 700 mM SLS.

40|$|T- 20 is a {{synthetic}} peptide that potently inhibits replication of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 by interfering with the transition of the transmembrane protein, gp 41, to a fusion active state following interactions of the surface glycoprotein, gp 120, with CD 4 and coreceptor molecules displayed on the target cell surface. Although T- 20 is postulated to interact with an N-terminal heptad repeat within gp 41 in a trans-dominant manner, we show here that sensitivity to T- 20 is strongly influenced by coreceptor specificity. When 14 T- 20 -naive primary isolates were analyzed for sensitivity to T- 20, the mean 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for isolates that utilize CCR 5 for entry (R 5 viruses) was 0. 8 log 10 higher than the mean IC 50 for CXCR 4 (X 4) isolates (P = 0. 0055). Using NL 4. 3 -based envelope chimeras that contain combinations of envelope sequences derived from R 5 and X 4 viruses, we found that determinants of coreceptor specificity contained within the gp 120 V 3 loop modulate this sensitivity to T- 20. The IC 50 for all chimeric <b>envelope</b> <b>viruses</b> containing R 5 V 3 sequences was 0. 6 to 0. 8 log 10 higher than that for viruses containing X 4 V 3 sequences. In addition, we confirmed that the N-terminal heptad repeat of gp 41 determines the baseline sensitivity to T- 20 and that the IC 50 for viruses containing GIV at amino acid residues 36 to 38 was 1. 0 log 10 lower than the IC 50 for viruses containing a G-to-D substitution.

Thus, similar to gH of herpes simplex virus, gH of pseudorabies virus is required for entry and cell-to-cell spread.
