5|$|<b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> Protragoceros labidotus and Sivoreas eremita {{dating back}} to the late Miocene have been {{discovered}} in the Ngorora formation (Kenya). fossils from the same period have also been excavated in the eastern Mediterranean region. Other Miocene <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> boselaphines discovered are of Miotragocerus, Tragocerus and Tragoportax. <b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> Miotragoceros are not apparent in Africa (only M. cyrenaicus has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several Tragoportax species. A 2005 study suggested the migration of Miotragoceros to eastern Asia around 8 Mya. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, Mesembriportax, from Langebaanweg (South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Megalodon had {{a global}} {{distribution}} and <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> the shark {{have been found}} in many places around the world, bordering all oceans of the Neogene.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> oak, sycamore, maple, ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E
50|$|The {{uncertainty}} about when a taxon first appeared {{makes it difficult}} to be confident about the ancestry of specific genera. For example, if the earliest known <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> genus X is much earlier than the earliest known <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> genus Y and genus Y has all the features of genus X plus a few of its own, it is natural to suppose that X is an ancestor of Y. But this hypothesis could be called into question at any time by the finding <b>of</b> a <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> Y that is earlier than any known <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> X - unless an even older <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> genus X is found, and so on.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 a <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> Yabeinosaurus was {{discovered}} with 15 well-developed embryos inside it, {{making it the}} oldest <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> a pregnant, viviparous (live-bearing) lizard yet discovered.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> {{what may}} be L. indica was found in Late Miocene strate of Los Angeles, California, along with a <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> the related Borophryne apogon, during the {{construction}} of a metrorail.|$|R
5|$|Adam Yates (2004) {{described}} a single sauropod tail vertebra from the Upper Elliot Formation of South Africa that may {{belong to a}} genus closely related to Vulcanodon. The Upper Elliot Formation {{is famous for its}} abundant <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> the prosauropod Massospondylus.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> them to be extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
50|$|Kakabekia is an {{about two}} billion-year-old <b>fossil</b> genus <b>of</b> {{microorganism}} from the Gunflint Chert. Kakabekia barghoorniana {{is a living}} <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> this genus.|$|R
50|$|Eight {{species of}} jacana are known from six genera. The <b>fossil</b> record <b>of</b> this family is {{restricted}} to a recent <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> the wattled jacana from Brazil and a Pliocene <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> an extinct species, Jacana farrandi, from Florida. A fossil from Miocene rocks in the Czech Republic was assigned to this family, but more recent analysis disputes the placement and moves the species to the Coraciidae.|$|R
50|$|Crinoids are {{the state}} <b>fossil</b> <b>of</b> Missouri.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and {{no significant difference in the}} sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. <b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Sri Lankan fossils, the island's fossil records from around 40,000 BP onwards are much more complete. Excavated <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> {{skeletal}} and cultural remains from this period provide the earliest records of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in South Asia, {{and some of the}} earliest evidence for the use of a specific type of stone tool.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E

5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline. This coast was home to an ancient {{ancestor}} of the lungfish, which would burrow in the mud to survive dry spells. <b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> these burrows have been discovered in the red siltstone formations in and near the park.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> K. aethiopicus {{have been}} found only in the Tendaguru Formation, dated to the late Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages, about 152 million years ago. Hundreds of bones were {{unearthed}} by German expeditions to German East Africa between 1909 and 1912. Although no complete skeletons are known, the remains provided a nearly complete picture of the build of the animal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean and Caribbean {{species are}} {{known from the}} Pleistocene. The time of {{divergence}} between the Hawaiian and Caribbean species, 3.7 million years (Ma) ago, corresponds to {{the closing of the}} Central American Seaway by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The divergence between Mediterranean seals and the New World clade was dated to 6.3 Ma ago.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fossils</b> <b>of</b> the extinct {{red panda}} Parailurus anglicus have been {{unearthed}} from China {{in the east}} to Britain in the west. In 1977, a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia. In 2004, a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5–7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa. Additional <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012. The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played {{a large role in}} the overall ecosystem of the area.|$|E
5|$|In his 1778 work Epochs of Nature Georges Buffon {{referred}} to fossils, {{in particular the}} discovery of <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> tropical species such as elephants and rhinoceros in northern Europe, as evidence for {{the theory that the}} earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling.|$|E
5|$|Kimberella dwelt {{in shallow}} waters (up {{to tens of}} meters in depth), sharing the calm, well-oxygenated sea floor with {{photosynthetic}} organisms and microbial mats. Assemblages bearing Kimberella often also bear <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Andiva, Yorgia, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium and Charniodiscus, suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms.|$|E

5|$|Most Actiniaria do {{not form}} hard parts {{that can be}} {{recognized}} as fossils, but a few <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea anemone.|$|E
5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specimens}} {{from this}} deposit collected and described by Massalongo in 1855 were actually trace fossils, and they remain assigned to Zoophycos; only the specimens of Z. caput-medusae {{have been assigned}} to Postelsiopsis, as those are <b>fossils</b> <b>of</b> the original plant, and not trace fossils.|$|E
