40|$|The bovine fetus, {{like that}} of other species, is a semi-allograft and the {{regulation}} of materno-fetal alloimmunity is critical to prevent its immunological rejection. In cattle, a materno-fetal alloimmune response may be beneficial at parturition. It is hypothesized that upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on the <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> {{toward the end of}} gestation induces a maternal alloimmune response that activates innate immune effector mechanisms, aiding in the loss of the adherence between the <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and the uterus. Loss of fetal–maternal adherence is pivotal for the timely expulsion of the <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and the absence (or reduction) of the maternal immune response may lead to retained <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> a common reproductive disorder of cattle.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is {{a member}} of the {{transforming}} growth factor-β superfamily, playing a role in sexual differentiation and recruitment. Since a correlation exists between AMH serum levels in cord blood and fetal sex, the present study aimed to identify mRNA and protein expression of AMH and AMHRII in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> according to <b>fetal</b> sex. METHODS: Placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> samples (n = 40) were collected from women with singleton uncomplicated pregnancies at term. Identification of AMH protein in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> was carried out by immunohistochemistry and AMH and AMHRII protein localization by immunofluorescence, while mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: AMH and AMHRII mRNAs were expressed by placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> at term, without any significant difference between males and females. Placental immunostaining showed a syncytial localization of AMH without sex-related differences; while <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> immunostaining was significantly more intense in male than in female fetuses (p < 0, 01). Immunofluorescence showed an intense co-localization of AMH and AMHRII in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> DISCUSSION: The present study for the first time demonstrated that human placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> expresses and co-localizes AMH and AMHRII. Although no sex-related difference was found for the mRNA expression both in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> a most intense staining for AMH in male <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> supports AMH as a gender specific hormon...|$|R

A significant proportion of spontaneous preterm births are associated with infection. Infection activates inflammation which induces a cascade of events that leads to myometrial contractions and rupture of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> In non-gestational tissues, the citrus flavone nobiletin has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, in this study, we sought to determine the effect of nobiletin on pro-inflammatory mediators in human <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and myometrium. Human <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and myometrium were treated with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the absence or presence of nobiletin. In addition, the effect of nobiletin in <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> taken from spontaneous preterm deliveries with and without infection (i. e. histological chorioamnionitis) was also examined. In human <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and myometrium, nobiletin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL- 1 b, IL- 6 and IL- 8) and MMP- 9 expression and pro-MMP- 9 secretion.

However, most cases show that the first three months in a pregnancy are when most birth defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form.

40|$|Preterm birth (PTB) is {{clinically}} {{defined as}} process of giving birth before 37 weeks of gestation {{and is a}} leading cause of death among neonates and {{children under the age of}} five. Prematurity remains a critical issue in developed countries, yet our understanding of the pathophysiology of PTB remains largely unknown. Among pregnancy complications, subclinical infections such as chorioamnionitis (CAM) are implicated in up to 70 % of PTB cases. Specifically, CAM is characterized by the infection of the fetal membranes that surround the developing fetus and extend from the placenta, and is often associated with preterm, premature rupture of the fetal membranes (PPROM). The <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> plays a key structural role in maintaining the fetal and maternal compartments of the gravid uterus. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of PPROM and the spatio-temporal progress of CAM remains vastly unknown. A lack of human-derived models have hindered our understanding of the mechanism that govern spontaneous PTB. Thus, in this short review, we discuss the emerging microfabrication technologies, specifically, organ-on-chip (OoCs) models, that seek to recapitulate the cellular and molecular context of the gestational membranes in vitro. These models show promise to facilitate the investigation of pathologic mechanisms that drive these disease conditions by mimicking the interactive contribution of the major cell types that make up the microenvironment of the <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> and enable high throughput screening. Herein, we histologically characterize the microenvironment of the <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> as a metric for scaling to recapitulate the functional components of the human <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane.</b> We review the current OoC models of the gravid uterus and conceptualize an “Instrumented <b>Fetal</b> <b>Membrane</b> on a Chip” (IFMOC) design as a prototype for PPROM and CAM research.

40|$|Preterm {{premature}} rupture {{of fetal}} membranes (PPROM) {{is associated with}} infection, {{and is one of}} the most common causes of preterm birth. Abnormal expression of biglycan and decorin, two extracellular matrix proteoglycans, leads to preterm birth and aberrant <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> morphology and signaling in the mouse. In humans and mice, decorin dysregulation is associated with inflammation in PPROM. We therefore investigated the link between biglycan and decorin and inflammation in fetal membranes using mouse models of intraperitoneal Escherichia coli injections superimposed on genetic biglycan and decorin deficiencies. We assessed outcomes in vivo as well as in vitro using quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Our results suggest that biglycan and decorin compensate for each other in the fetal membranes, but lose the ability to do so under inflammation, leading to decreased latency to preterm birth. Furthermore, our findings suggest that biglycan and decorin play discrete roles in <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> signaling pathways during inflammation, leading to changes in the abundance of MMP 8 and collagen α 1 VI, two components of the <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> extracellular matrix that influence the pathophysiology of PPROM. In summary, these findings underline the importance of biglycan and decorin as targets for the manipulation of <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> extracellular matrix stability in the context of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{region of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> {{overlying}} the cervix, {{known as the}} zone of altered morphology (ZAM), {{is considered to be}} the principle site of membrane inflammatory activity and extracellular matrix remodelling. We wished to quantify the relative contribution of each area of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> to the inflammatory process of parturition. Specifically, we aimed to quantify and compare (1) leukocyte densities in three regions of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and decidua before and during spontaneous labor at term, and (2) mRNA expression of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, cyclo-oxygenase type 1 (COX- 1), and COX- 2 in three regions of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and decidua before and during spontaneous labor at term. METHODS: Biopsies of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and decidua were obtained from pregnant women delivered by cesarean section at term both before and during spontaneous labor (n = 8 both groups). <b>Fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> were sampled from three areas, the ZAM, midzone (MZ), and periplacental (PP) regions. Leukocytes were identified by immunohistochemistry and their density quantified. Inflammatory mediator expression was quantified using TaqMan technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RESULTS: There was a significantly greater density of leukocytes in (1) the PP region of membranes compared with the ZAM, and (2) the decidua compared with amnion, amniotic connective tissue, and chorion. IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8 mRNA expression was significantly greater in all regions following spontaneous labor compared with nonlaboring tissues. There were no regional differences in cytokine expression within the <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> Choriodecidua expressed significantly more IL- 1 beta mRNA than amnion. Amnion expressed more COX- 2 mRNA than choriodecidua. CONCLUSIONS: All regions of <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and decidua contribute to the inflammatory process of human parturition; however, their relative contributions differ in magnitude. Although the ZAM may be specifically important for membrane rupture, it does not appear to play a key or exclusive role in the other inflammatory processes of parturition.

STUDY DESIGN: Native AS were engineered from freshly harvested membranes of 23 days' gestational age (GA; term = 31 - 2 d). Acellularity of AS was assessed by histology, light and scanning electron microscopy. <b>Fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> defects were created by 14 gauge-needle puncture at GA 23 days and primarily closed with AS (n = 10) or DegraPol (n = 10) or left unclosed (positive controls; n = 10). Sixty-one sacs served as negative controls. At GA 30 days a second look hysterotomy was performed to assess presence of amniotic fluid (AF) and harvest plugging sites for microscopic evaluation. RESULTS: Engineered AS had a cell-free collagenous fiber network. AF was significantly higher only in the DegraPol group (78 %; P <. 05) compared to the AF in positive controls (17 %). Integration of plugs in the <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> defect was better with AS than DegraPol, with higher reepithelialization rates (AS: 52. 5 % +/- 6. 5 %; DegraPol: 11. 6 % +/- 2. 6 %; P <. 001) and proliferation indices (AS: 0. 47 +/- 0. 03; DegraPol: 0. 28 +/- 0. 04; P =. 001). In both treatment groups, cell proliferation in the myometrium was increased (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: Native AS seal iatrogenic <b>fetal</b> <b>membrane</b> defects better than DegraPol. Within a week, there is abundant reepithelilization and minimal local inflammation.

Here we report that before the onset of active labor the amnion epithelial cells undergo apoptotic cell death which encompasses degradation of 28 S ribosomal subunit RNA and associated P proteins and fragmentation of nuclear DNA. Concurrent with these cellular changes, the amnion type I collagen matrix is degraded with the accumulation of three-quarter length type I collagen fragments in extraembryonic fluid, characteristic of the cleavage of fibrillar collagen by interstitial collagenase. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that interstitial collagenase protein appears in association with the loss of amnion type I collagen.

Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study wa s to d evelop simplified finite element models to investigate the mechanical behaviour and rupture of the fetal mem brane, particularly its constituent layers, under various physiological conditions.

Reverse zymography detected a broad range of TIMP activity with molecular weights of 27 - 30 kDa (TIMP- 1, glycosylated TIMP- 3 and TIMP- 4), 24 kDa (unglycosylated TIMP- 3) and 21 kDa (TIMP- 2). Following fetoscopy, both MMP- 2 and TIMP increased significantly in amniotic fluid and extra-embryonic coelomic fluid, but not in allantoic fluid, as demonstrated by densitometric analyses.

40|$|Five {{antibodies}} that stained renin in {{the kidney}} {{were used to}} investigate the presence of renin in human placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> Despite {{a large number of}} experimental approaches to enhance penetration of the immunoglobulins, only two of them showed immunostaining in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> Staining was found in placental syncytiotrophoblast, the amnionic epithelium overlying the placenta, and in glandular epithelial cells present in the decidua adhering to the <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> It was most consistent, however, in a small infiltrating cell type dispersed through the fetoplacental layers. The two antibodies that revealed immunostaining in all preparations showed high affinity cross-reactivity with cathepsin D. Among other, less plausible, explanations, this raises the possibility that the bulk of 'renin' found in placenta and <b>fetal</b> <b>membranes</b> is not identical to renal renin, but may be cathepsin D or a substance related to both cathepsin D and renin. status: publishe...|$|R
