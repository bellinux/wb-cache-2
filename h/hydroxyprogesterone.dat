5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, <b>hydroxyprogesterone</b> caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{previously}} available alone in 5mg tablets under {{the brand name}} Norlutin in the U.S., but this formulation has since been discontinued in this country. However, NETA remains available alone in 5mg tablets under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate in the U.S. It {{is one of the}} only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the U.S. The others include progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and <b>hydroxyprogesterone</b> caproate, as well as the atypical agent danazol.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, <b>hydroxyprogesterone</b> caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E

It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with an acetate ester at the C17α position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions.

50|$|The {{observation}} of two-fold improved potency of 17α-MP relative to progesterone led to {{renewed interest in}} 17α-substituted derivatives of progesterone. Subsequently, <b>hydroxyprogesterone</b> acetate and <b>hydroxyprogesterone</b> caproate were synthesized in 1953 and introduced in 1956 and 1957, respectively, and medroxyprogesterone acetate was discovered in 1956 and introduced in 1959. In addition, though 17α-MP itself was never introduced for medical use, progestogen derivatives of the compound, including medrogestone (1966) and the 19-norprogesterone derivatives demegestone (1974), promegestone (1983), and trimegestone (2001), have been marketed.|$|E

50|$|Although esters of steroidal androgens and estrogens are {{generally}} inactive themselves {{and act as}} prodrugs, the same is not true for many progestogen esters.
