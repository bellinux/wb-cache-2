50|$|The {{pressure}} for the Olympics was intense. Despite several silvers and bronzes, Canada had only won two {{gold medals in}} figure skating, in 1948 and 1960, and it was hoped by many that Salé and Pelletier would do well. They skated a clean short program, only to trip and fall on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction. The pair placed second behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. In the long program, Salé and Pelletier also placed second. A minor <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> out error from Sikharulidze and a clean program from the Canadians had convinced some they had won the gold but when the judges' scores came up, Salé and Pelletier had been placed second in the long program. Five judges had awarded the long program to Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, and only four to Salé and Pelletier. This result spurred an outcry from the North American media and booing from many audience members, but Salé and Pelletier accepted the silver medal. After the competition, the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she had been pressured {{by the head of}} her federation, Didier Gailhaguet, into awarding the long program to the Russians and a judging controversy quickly blew up. The scandal ultimately resulted in the suspension of several judges and officials. The results of the competition were discarded and Salé and Pelletier were awarded a second set of gold medals in a special ceremony later in the week.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of the circle dance in {{decreasing}} depressed affect amongst a group of 45 patients with severe mental health illnesses and highlights the most significant aspect of that dance. Patients participated in one of four conditions: a group performing a regular traditional upbeat Irish circle dance holding hands and with a <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> [jump+hands]; a group performing the same dance holding hands with no <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> [hands]; a group performing the same dance without holding hands and with the <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> [jump]; and a control group performing a concentration test [control]. All three experimental groups reported a decrease in depressed affect in contrast to the control group, which reported none. Therefore, while the long-term benefits of regular circle dancing are yet to be researched, this set of results supports the existing literature in finding a definite temporary improvement. In terms of the most significant aspect, results suggest that the patients doing the dance holding hands with no <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> [hands] benefited most from the intervention: a more significant decrease in depressive affect (and an increase in vitality) was found amongst this group compared with the other two experimental groups. Integral to the heritage of cultures throughout the world, circle dancing has always been considered an uplifting, celebratory and inclusive activity. Perhaps from these traditional roots will spring some new ideas in response to the growing problem of depression. Certainly, {{the findings of this study}} point towards a wider appropriation of traditional circle dancing in DMT practice...|$|E

Pointer jumping on a list of n elements consists of O (log 2 n) <b>jumping</b> <b>steps.</b> Traditionally, these steps are synchronized. That is, at the end of each <b>jumping</b> <b>step,</b> processors wait until all the processors complete their work for the current step. Theoretically, however, pointer jumping doesn’t require synchronization. Without jeopardizing the correctness of execution, a processor may proceed to the next step as soon as it completes the current step. We implemented both synchronized and unsynchronized pointer jumping on a parallel computer with distributed memory. We expected the unsynchronized implementation to run faster because processors were not forced to idle. To the contrary, we observed an anomaly: the unsynchronized implementation ran more slowly. We present empirical data and explain how the absence of synchronization causes such an anomaly to occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} epipolar {{geometry}} estimation together with correspondence establishment {{in case of}} wide baseline and large scale changes and rotation has been addressed in this work. This work deals with cases that are heavily noised by outliers. The jump diffusion MCMC method has been employed {{to search for the}} non-degenerate epipolar geometry with the highest probabilistic support of putative correspondences. At the same time, inliers in the putative set are also identified. The <b>jump</b> <b>steps</b> involve large movements guided by a distribution of similarity based priors while diffusion steps are small movements guided by a distribution of likelihoods given by the Joint Feature Distribution (JFD). The 2 ̆ 7 best so far 2 ̆ 7 samples are accepted in accordance to Metropolis-Hastings method. The diffusion steps are carried out by sampling conditioned on the 2 ̆ 7 best so far 2 ̆ 7, making it local to the 2 ̆ 7 best so far 2 ̆ 7 sample, while <b>jump</b> <b>steps</b> remain unconditioned and span across the correspondence and motion space according to a similarity based proposal distribution making large movements. We advance the theory in three novel ways. First, a similarity based prior proposal distribution which guide <b>jump</b> <b>steps.</b> Second, JFD based likelihoods which guide diffusion steps allowing more focused correspondence establishment while searching for epipolar geometry.

40|$|In many {{practical}} problems, {{time series}} are realizations of nonstationary random processes. These processes {{can often be}} modeled as processes with slowly changing dynamics or as piecewise stationary processes. In these cases, various approaches to estimating the timevarying spectral density have been proposed. Our approach {{in this article is}} to estimate the log of the Dahlhaus local spectrum using a Bayesian mixture of splines. The basic idea of our approach is to first partition the data into small sections. We then assume that the log spectral density of the evolutionary process in any given partition is a mixture of individual log spectra. We use a mixture of smoothing splines model with time varying mixing weights to estimate the evolutionary log spectrum. The mixture model is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that yield estimates of the log spectra of the individual subsections. In addition to an estimate of the local log spectral density, the method yields pointwise credible intervals. We use a reversible <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> to automatically determine the number of different spectral components...|$|E

This paper presents {{the development and implementation}} of a novel inertial sensor-based foot-mounted wearable electronic device for a brand new application: game playing. The main objective of the introduced system is to monitor and identify the human foot stepping direction in real time, and coordinate these motions to control the player operation in games. This proposed system extends the utilized field of currently available wearable devices and introduces a convenient and portable medium to perform exercise in a more compelling way in the near future. This paper provides an overview of the previously-developed system platforms, introduces the main idea behind this novel application, and describes the implemented human foot moving direction identification algorithm. Practical experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of recognizing five foot motions, <b>jump,</b> <b>step</b> left, step right, step forward, and step backward, and has achieved an over 97 % accuracy performance for different users.

40|$|Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), as {{one type}} of the storage systems, serves as a {{particularly}} important role for future power grid systems. However, since both the capital cost of BESS and the potential economic value vary dramatically for large-scale systems, the total cost induced by BESS remains {{a major source of}} uncertainty for potential power system operators when the limited lifetime of BESS is taken into account. Therefore, appropriate configuration and operation of BESS are of paramount importance for its deployments in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel model for BESS that attempts to capture the fact of limited lifetime and to exploit the potential economic value. We develop a finite horizon optimization model for BESS operators with unknown stopping-time. The stopping-time is determined by the policy itself, which makes the problem technically challenging. We first propose an algorithm called Forward-iteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (FirLP), which solves the problem by iterating on every time instance and achieves the optimality. Subsequently, we observe that some time instances are not necessary to be iterated on. Thus, we propose Jump-iteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (JirLP). By utilizing a well defined <b>jump</b> <b>step,</b> we can avoid exhaustive iteration on those unnecessary time instances. We examine our model and algorithms with the real price data. The computational results further validate our model, and shows that our proposed JirLP can achieve optimality and reduce the unnecessary iterations by 50 % in comparison with the FirLP. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|We congratulate Kou, Zhou and Wong {{for making}} a {{fundamental}} contribution to MCMC. Our discussion consists of two parts. First, we ask several questions about the EE-sampler. Then we review a data-driven MCMC scheme for solving computer vision problems. 1. Questions. To simplify the language, we use π(x) to denote a distribution we want to sample from, and q(x) to denote a distribution at a higher temperature (with energy truncation). The distributions π(x) and q(x) {{can be understood as}} two consecutive levels in the EE-sampler. Suppose we have obtained a sample from q(x) by running a Markov chain (with a burn-in period), and let us call the sampled states q-states. Suppose we have also formed the energy rings by grouping these q-states. Now consider sampling from π(x) by the EE-sampler. 1. In the <b>jump</b> <b>step,</b> can we make the chain jump to a q-state outside the intended energy ring? For example, can we simply propose to jump to any random q-states, as if performing the Metropolized independent sampler [2] with q(x) as the proposal distribution? Without restricting the jump to the intended energy ring, {{it is possible that the}} chain jumps to a q-state of a higher energy level than the current state, but it is also possible that it lands on a lower-energy q-state. If the energy of the current state is very low, we may not have any q-states in the corresponding energy ring to make the EE jump. But if we do not restrict the chain to the current energy ring, it may jump to a higher-energy q-state and escape the local mode. The reason we ask this question is that the power of the EE-sampler seems to come from its reuse of the q-states, or the long memory of the chain, instead of the EE feature. Received November 2005.

40|$|A typical gene {{expression}} data set consists of measurements {{of a large}} number of {{gene expression}}s, on a relatively small number of subjects, classified according to two or more outcomes, for example cancer or non-cancer. The identification of associations between gene expressions and outcome is a huge multiple testing problem. Early approaches to this problem involved the application of thousands of univariate tests with corrections for multiplicity. Over the past decade, numerous studies have demonstrated that analyzing gene expression data structured into predefined gene sets can produce benefits in terms of statistical power and robustness when compared to alternative approaches. This thesis presents the results of research on gene set analysis. In particular, it examines the properties of some existing methods for the analysis of gene sets. It introduces novel Bayesian methods for gene set analysis. A distinguishing feature of these methods is that the model is specified conditionally on the expression data, whereas other methods of gene set analysis and IGA generally make inferences conditionally on the outcome. Computer simulation is used to compare three common established methods for gene set analysis. In this simulation study a new procedure for the simulation of gene expression data is introduced. The simulation studies are used to identify situations in which the established methods perform poorly. The Bayesian approaches developed in this thesis apply reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) techniques to model gene expression effects on phenotype. The reversible <b>jump</b> <b>step</b> in the modelling procedure allows for posterior probabilities for activeness of gene set to be produced. These mixture models reverse the generally accepted conditionality and model outcome given gene expression, which is a more intuitive assumption when modelling the pathway to phenotype. It is demonstrated that the two models proposed may be superior to the established methods studied. There is considerable scope for further development of this line of research, which is appealing in terms of the use of mixture model priors that reflect the belief that a relatively small number of genes, restricted to a small number of gene sets, are associated with the outcome...|$|E
