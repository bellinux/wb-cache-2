40|$|Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008] {{study the}} {{spreading}} {{of a message}} in an Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, p) starting from a set of vertices that <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of the message initially. In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can <b>be</b> <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R

When He asked Martha, “Do you believe this?” He was asking her if she <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the person who lives and believes in Him will never die spiritually. <b>Being</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>is</b> certainty, not some percentage of certainty.
