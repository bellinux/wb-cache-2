5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal <b>declarative</b> <b>memory,</b> semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

50|$|Motor skills, {{also known}} as {{procedural}} memories, are distinct from <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> which involve memories of events, people, places, etc. Both types of memories are, however, subject to a consolidation period, though the neural mechanisms appear to differ. Some of the earliest evidence pointing to a distinction between procedural and <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> came from the famous neurology patient HM. As a treatment for severe epilepsy, portions of HM's temporal lobes, including both hippocampi, were removed. This left him unable to form new <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> (anterograde amnesia), while his ability to learn novel motor tasks remained intact.|$|R
50|$|<b>Declarative</b> <b>memory's</b> {{counterpart}} {{is known}} as implicit memory or procedural memory, which refers to unconscious memories such as skills (e.g. learning to ride a bicycle).|$|R
25|$|As {{prospective}} memory involves remembering and fulfilling an intention, {{it requires}} episodic memory, <b>declarative</b> <b>memory,</b> and retrospective memory, followed by supervisory executive functions. All {{of these are}} controlled by the frontal lobe which is situated {{at the front of}} the cerebral hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Together, {{semantic}} and {{episodic memory}} make up our <b>declarative</b> <b>memory.</b> They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
25|$|The hippocampal {{areas are}} {{important}} to semantic memory's involvement with <b>declarative</b> <b>memory.</b> The left inferior prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left posterior temporal areas are other areas involved in semantic memory use. Temporal lobe damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to semantic impairments. Damage to {{different areas of the}} brain affect semantic memory differently.|$|E
40|$|Do our {{memories}} remain static during sleep, {{or do they}} change? We argue here that memory change {{is not only a}} natural result of sleep cognition, but further, that such change constitutes a fundamental characteristic of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories.</b> In general, <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> change due to retrieval events at various times after initial learning and due to the formation and elaboration of associations with other memories, including memories formed after the initial learning episode. We propose that <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> change both during waking and during sleep, and that such change contributes to enhancing binding of the distinct representational components of some memories, and thus to a gradual process of cross-cortical consolidation. As a result of this special form of consolidation, <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> can become more cohesive and also more thoroughly integrated with other stored information. Further benefits of this memory reprocessing can include developing complex networks of interrelated memories, aligning memories with long-term strategies and goals, and generating insights based on novel combinations of memory fragments. A variety of research findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cross-cortical consolidation can progress during sleep, although further support is needed, and we suggest some potentially fruitful research directions. Determining how processing during sleep can facilitate memory storage will be an exciting focus of research in the coming years. The idea that memory storage is supported by events that tak...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{relatively}} small body of evidence that supports the idea that REM sleep helps consolidate highly emotional <b>declarative</b> <b>memories.</b> For instance Wagner, et al. compared memory retention for emotional versus neutral text over two instances; early sleep that is dominated by SWS and late sleep that is dominated by REM phase. This study found that sleep improved memory retention of emotional text only during late sleep phase, which was primarily REM. Similarly, Hu & Stylos-Allen, et al. performed a study with emotional versus neutral pictures and concluded that REM sleep facilitates consolidation of emotional <b>declarative</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} {{the brain}} structures located within the medial temporal lobe and {{is considered one of the}} main structures of the brain associated with eyewitness testimony because it is the area that is important for the formation of long term <b>memories.</b> <b>Declarative</b> <b>memories</b> are long term memories that can be consciously remembered, which include: specific events and factual knowledge. Eyewitnesses use <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> specifically episodic memory when they are asked to recall specific events that took place in the past. For example, [...] "Do you remember what the doctor said to you last time you visited him?" [...] Research on children as eyewitnesses found that children do not have accurate long term memories for past events.|$|R
25|$|The memory {{impairment}} that is pathognomonic to Korsakoff's syndrome predominantly {{affects the}} <b>declarative</b> <b>memory,</b> leaving non-declarative memory {{that is often}} procedural in nature relatively intact. The disproportionate severity in anterograde episodic memory processes in contrast to other cognitive processes is what differentiates Korsakoff syndrome from other conditions such as alcohol-related dementia. Evidence {{for the preservation of}} certain memory processes in the presence of severe anterograde episodic memory serve as experimental paradigm to investigate the components of human memory.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal evidence, from an amnesic patient named CH who {{suffered}} from <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> deficits, was obtained supporting a preserved memory capacity for song titles. CH's unique knowledge of accordion music allowed for experimenters to test verbal and musical associations. When presented with song titles CH was able to successfully play the correct song 100% of the time, and when presented with the melody she chose the appropriate title from several distractors with a 90% success rate.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} anterograde amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. <b>Declarative</b> <b>memory</b> can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas semantic memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed anterograde amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained semantic memory while suffering an extreme impairment of episodic memory.|$|E
40|$|To behave {{effectively}} and flexibly in complex situations, models specified in cognitive architectures {{must be able}} to store and access large amounts of declarative knowledge. However, as research efforts employing cognitive modeling grow in scope and complexity, currently available modeling tools, languages and cognitive architectures are being pushed to their practical limits. This paper describes research looking specifically at how a large <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> challenge the current implementation of ACT-R and describes an applied effort to develop an alternative implementation of ACT-R’s retrieval process. The alternative exploits concurrency features of the Erlang programming language to extend the practicality of ACT-R’s retrieval mechanisms to new levels of scale. The ideas and methods underlying the alternative implementation are general and illustrate how concurrency can accelerate calculation in other architectures struggling to support large associative <b>declarative</b> <b>memories...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is not yet}} completely developed until 2-8 {{years of}} age; however, there are mixed findings for the exact moment when the hippocampus stops maturing. Though the hippocampus may stop maturing at a certain age, behavioural evidence shows that <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> are known to develop from childhood up until adulthood.|$|R
50|$|Memory {{processes}} {{have been}} shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) by nocturnal sleep and even daytime naps. Certain sleep stages are noted to improve an individual's memory, although this is task specific. Generally, <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> are enhanced by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative memories are enhanced by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results.|$|R
25|$|Combining Hobson's {{activation}} synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation {{theory of}} dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming {{is a result}} of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the long-term memory store. During NREM sleep the conscious-related memory (<b>declarative</b> <b>memory)</b> is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (procedural memory) is processed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} types of memory {{have been identified in}} humans, such as <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> (including episodic memory and semantic memory), working memory, spatial memory, and procedural memory. Studies done, have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the medial temporal lobe are especially vulnerable to age-related decline. A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as histological, structural imaging, functional imaging, and receptor binding have supplied converging evidence that the frontal lobes and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.|$|E
25|$|Various neural {{imaging and}} {{research}} points to semantic memory and episodic memory resulting from distinct {{areas in the}} brain. Still other research suggests that both semantic memory and episodic memory {{are part of a}} singular <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether semantic or episodic memory is accessed. Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way {{as a result of the}} activation of different mental processes during retrieval.|$|E
50|$|Stickgold et al. (2000) have {{proposed}} that Tetris imagery is a separate form of memory, likely related to procedural memory. This is from their research in which they showed that people with anterograde amnesia, unable to form new <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> reported dreaming of falling shapes after playing Tetris during the day, despite {{not being able to}} remember playing the game at all.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} model of systems consolidation largely {{applies to the}} formation of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> which include semantic, factual memories and episodic, autobiographical memories. This has been supported by case studies of human patients with MTH lesions who exhibit difficulties in remembering experiences and fact learned post-surgery, however are able to retain motor and skill memories such as how to ride a bike or perform mirror tracing tasks.|$|R
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> move between the limbic system, deep within the brain, and the outer, {{cortical}} regions. These are distinct from the mechanisms of the more primitive cerebellum, which dominates in the blinking response and receives the input of auditory information directly. It {{does not need to}} [...] "reach out" [...] to other brain structures for assistance in forming some memories of simple association.|$|R
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose <b>declarative</b> <b>memory,</b> or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often remember how to perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E
25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for <b>declarative</b> <b>memory.</b> According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.|$|E
50|$|Conscious events {{interact}} with memory systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.The IDA model elucidates {{the role of}} consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory, transient episodic memory, and procedural memory. Transient episodic and <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> have distributed representations in IDA, {{there is evidence that}} this is also the case in the nervous system. In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of Kanerva’s Sparse distributed memory architecture.|$|R
40|$|Sleep can {{favor the}} {{consolidation}} of both procedural and <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> promote gist extraction, help the integration of new with old memories, and desaturate the ability to learn. It is often assumed that such beneficial effects are due to the reactivation of neural circuits in sleep to further strengthen the synapses modified during wake or transfer memories to {{different parts of the}} brain. A different possibility is that sleep may benefit memory not by further strengthening synapses, but rather by renormalizing synaptic strength to restore cellular homeostasis after net synaptic potentiation in wake. In this way, the sleep-dependent reactivation of neural circuits could result in the competitive down-selection of synapses that are activated infrequently and fit less well with the overall organization of memories. By using computer simulations, we show here that synaptic down-selection is in principle sufficient to explain the beneficial effects of sleep on {{the consolidation of}} procedural and <b>declarative</b> <b>memories,</b> on gist extraction, and on the integration of new with old memories, thereby addressing the plasticity-stability dilemma...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{supports}} {{the consolidation of}} memory in adults. Childhood is a period hallmarked by huge demands of brain plasticity as well as great amounts of efficient sleep. Whether sleep supports memory consolidation in children as in adults is unclear. We compared effects of nocturnal sleep (versus daytime wakefulness) on consolidation of declarative (word-pair associates, two-dimensional [2 D] object location), and procedural memories (finger sequence tapping) in 15 children (6 – 8 yr) and 15 adults. Beneficial effects of sleep on retention of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> were comparable in children and adults. However, opposite to adults, children showed smaller improvement in finger-tapping skill across retention sleep than wakefulness, indicating that sleep-dependent procedural memory consolidation depends on developmental stage. Compelling evidence has been accumulated that sleep {{supports the}} consolidation of newly acquired memories in adults (Maquet 2001; Stickgold 2005; Born et al. 2006). <b>Declarative</b> <b>memories</b> benefit particularly from slow wave sleep (SWS), whereas proce-dural memories benefit particularly from REM sleep (Plihal and Born 1997; Peigneux et al. 2004; Marshall and Born 2007), aside from distinct contributions of non-REM sleep stage 2 to memor...|$|R
25|$|Further {{studies have}} looked at the {{specific}} effects of different stages of sleep on different types of memory. For example, it has been found that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but can produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set shown). Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Another study reported that the performance on free recall of a list of nouns is significantly worse when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 ± 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 ± 4 words). These results indicate the role of sleep on <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> formation. This has been further confirmed by observations of low metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex and temporal and parietal lobes for the temporal learning and verbal learning tasks respectively. Data analysis has also shown that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. Also, post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (1 hour), indicating long term potentiation.|$|E
500|$|Psychologists and neuroscientists {{generally}} {{agree that}} the hippocampus {{plays an important role}} in the formation of new memories about experienced events (episodic or autobiographical memory). Part of this function is hippocampal involvement in the detection of new events, places and stimuli. Some researchers regard the hippocampus as part of a larger medial temporal lobe memory system responsible for general <b>declarative</b> <b>memory</b> (memories that can be explicitly verbalized—these would include, for example, memory for facts in addition to episodic memory). The hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This partly why returning to a place (or context) where an emotional experience occurred may evoke that emotion. There is just a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places.|$|E

30|$|Evolution of the {{mechanism}} of memory stems from {{the mechanism}} of navigation [8]. This extends support to the hypothesis of a phylogenetic continuity and a direct relationship between the navigation and memory processes. Within this model, the hippocampus is considered as a central hub for the shared neural mechanisms that are recruited during navigation and <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> (episodic and semantic memory). The dichotomy of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories</b> is distinguishable like the two forms of the spatial frame of reference. Expanding on this idea, allocentric representation and semantic memory {{on one hand and}} egocentric representation and episodic memory on the other, support a common network for memory and navigation. Along the same lines, the integration of multiple routes into a cognitive map might be related to the integration of episodic memory contents with a semantic network [9]. In addition, the series of events encoded as spatial memory can be represented with the full support of episodic memory. All these shreds of evidence reflect the interwoven networks of navigation and memory [10]. This is the focal point of our study, as we have compared good and bad navigators with respect to their retrieval of spatial knowledge (memory and navigation).|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies suggest}} that non-rapid eye {{movement}} (NREM) sleep, especially slow-wave sleep (SWS), {{is vital to the}} consolidation of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories.</b> However, sleep stage 2 (S 2), which is the other NREM sleep stage besides SWS, has gained only little attention. The current study investigated whether S 2 during an afternoon nap contributes to the consolidation of <b>declarative</b> <b>memories.</b> Participants learned associations between faces and cities prior to a brief nap. A cued recall test was administered before and following the nap. Spindle, delta and slow oscillation activity was recorded during S 2 in the nap following learning and in a control nap. Increases in spindle activity, delta activity, and slow oscillation activity in S 2 in the nap following learning compared to the control nap were associated with enhanced retention of face-city associations. Furthermore, spindles tended to occur more frequently during up-states than down-states within slow oscillations during S 2 following learning versus S 2 of the control nap. These findings suggest that spindles, delta waves, and slow oscillations might promote memory consolidation not only during SWS, as shown earlier, but also during S 2...|$|R
