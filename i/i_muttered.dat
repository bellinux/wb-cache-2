60|$|<b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> grumpily, that I had no {{particular}} respect for Falk.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>muttered</b> some half-intelligible {{answer to}} this compliment, and my new {{acquaintance}} proceeded.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>muttered</b> {{something}} about being an outsider--wondered {{if there was anything}} I could do to help.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish <b>I</b> had,' <b>mutters</b> Wegg, {{with his}} back turned as he rose from his chair. St! Hush! The talking-over stranger, Mr Venus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're always a-comin' in, <b>I</b> think,' <b>muttered</b> Mrs Gamp to herself, 'except wen you're a-goin' out. I ha'n't no {{patience}} with that man!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> was <b>muttering</b> {{my thanks}} and my assurances that I was in {{excellent}} spirits, {{when we were}} suddenly disturbed by a rumbling noise as of distant thunder.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>muttered</b> {{something}} about never dancing, but I {{knew that that}} which I said was inaudible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfold your project, man," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> {{fiercely}} almost, in my burning eagerness. [...] "Let me {{hear what}} you would have me do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--'after life's fitful fever {{they sleep}} well,'" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered.</b> [...] "Where {{are you going}} now, Mrs. Fairfax?" [...] for she was moving away.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> began <b>muttering</b> something, {{feeling that}} {{the time had come}} when I must tell the tale. But Jack with great good nature, took up the story and told it so well, that I hardly {{suffered}} in the telling.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Make her ill! I wish <b>I</b> could!' <b>muttered</b> Lady Warwick, as {{she left}} the presence-chamber; 'but it is like my little Nan telling her apple-stock baby that all her kin were burnt alive in one castle. She heeds as much!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her mark," [...] he said. [...] "Here she has been--careless, {{attractive}} thing!--called away in haste, doubtless, {{and forgetting}} {{to return and}} put all to rights. Why does she leave fascination in her footprints? Whence did she acquire the gift to be heedless and never offend? There is always something to chide in her, and the reprimand never settles in displeasure on the heart, but, for her lover or her husband, when it had trickled a while in words, would naturally melt from his lips in a kiss. Better pass half an hour in remonstrating with her than a day in admiring or praising any other woman alive. Am <b>I</b> <b>muttering?</b> soliloquizing? Stop that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He and the second-mate {{are hard}} at it, sir--full and by, and going ten knots," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> wishing my tormentor in Japan, at the moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} more than enough of you, you blackguard," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> and I shook him till he groaned, and threw him across the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could get}} a chance at him," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> for even in this solemn moment I could {{cultivate}} no Christian spirit towards Imbozwi.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's in his nature, <b>I</b> know,' <b>muttered</b> the locksmith, 'it's {{cruel to}} ask him, but I must have help. Barnaby--good Barnaby--dear Barnaby--if {{you know this}} gentleman, {{for the sake of}} his life and everybody's life that loves him, help me to raise him and lay him down.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the mark of my old burn with a certain shrinking. ‘Beastly people!’ <b>I</b> heard him <b>mutter</b> to himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{must have}} <b>muttered</b> aloud {{something}} to myself about the Wandering Jew, {{for the old}} man spake up, bitterly and loudly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, who the deuce {{is making}} that noise?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered.</b> [...] "Some silly fool, I suppose, {{trying to think}} he's a waterfowl. Cut it out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At dead of night!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered.</b> Yes, {{that was}} ever {{the hour of}} {{fatality}} at Thornfield. [...] "Was it known how it originated?" [...] I demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good of you," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered</b> as I {{turned to}} grasp Steinar's hand, adding: [...] "I know well {{who it was}} that brought you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know--some crazy old lunatic, <b>I</b> suppose," [...] <b>muttered</b> {{the former}} student of Oak Hall. [...] "Is he--he--coming after me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jumps! Regular jumps! Who'd {{have thought}} it of Quatermain?" [...] <b>I</b> heard Stephen <b>mutter</b> in the {{intervals}} of lighting his pipe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would that <b>I</b> had!' <b>muttered</b> Philip, so {{low that}} she did not catch the words. Then aloud,--'No care could have been greater than was taken for me. It was as if no one had been ill but myself, and the whole thought of every one had been for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They ought to, I suppose," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> {{fighting}} against the insidious sweetness of her. I knew then I must keep my lips shut or betray myself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are things}} which are higher than discipline,' <b>I</b> <b>muttered.</b> 'I could not pass on and leave this poor soul in her distress. But see--what have we here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|I nodded humbly. [...] "Yes, yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> [...] "Midget is as Midget wears. I know that. And--and here, Miss Bowater, is {{a little}} Christmas present from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't believe it. Canting {{and tragedy}} queening. Taking him in! <b>I</b> know better!' <b>muttered</b> Owen, sullenly, {{as he moved}} up the bank.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{leaving his}} bones there, <b>I</b> hope," [...] <b>muttered</b> Lord Valleys. [...] "Really, it's too much. I should think you're all wrong, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now <b>I</b> wonder,' he <b>muttered,</b> 'whether my Agnes {{tires of}} me. When should I ever tire of her! But that's different, that's quite different.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Unconsciously I pulled {{upon the}} bridle, and the tired mule stopped. [...] "Malignant smallpox!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> [...] "and that fool {{is trying to}} treat it with cold water!"[*] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear, hear!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> quite {{moved by}} this eloquence. But Bausi {{was not at}} all moved; indeed, he seemed to view these poetic {{proposals}} with the darkest suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{suppose that}} is the 'invincible morgue Britannic in the {{presence}} of brutally provoked mutiny,'" [...] <b>I</b> <b>muttered,</b> as I turned over the pages of M. de C.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful, was it not? She sat quite confounded. 'Is it Robert Moore that speaks?' <b>I</b> {{heard her}} <b>mutter.</b> 'Is it a man--or {{something}} lower?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It was for you,' he began. 'Forgive.' His voice failed him. Presently <b>I</b> heard a <b>mutter</b> {{and caught}} the pitiful words: 'Not strong enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|My ghost! {{there was}} no doubt I was an {{exceedingly}} small human being. It may sound absurd, but I had never vividly realized it before. And how solemnly sitting there--like a spider in wait for flies. [...] "For goodness' sake, Miss M.," [...] I said to myself, [...] "cheer up. You are being deadly dull company--always half afraid. They daren't really do anything to you, you know. Face it out." [...] And even while <b>I</b> was <b>muttering,</b> <b>I</b> was reading the words cut into a worn tombstone at my feet: [...] "Jenetta Parker"--only two-and-twenty, a year older than I. Yet she had lain here for two whole centuries and more. And beneath her name I spelled out her epitaph:-- ...|$|R
