5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} <b>fatty</b> acids {{include the}} eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the <b>fatty</b> acid category are the <b>fatty</b> esters and <b>fatty</b> amides. <b>Fatty</b> esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, <b>fatty</b> acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, <b>fatty</b> acid thioester ACP derivatives and <b>fatty</b> acid carnitines. The <b>fatty</b> amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the lipid and <b>fatty</b> acid {{composition}} {{revealed that}} D.confragosa contains 20.1% total lipids (mg/g dry weight), 32.9% neutral lipids, 53.8% phospholipid, and 13.3% glycolipids. An analysis of hydroxy <b>fatty</b> acid content showed that D.confragosa contains, {{as a percentage}} of total <b>fatty</b> acids, 0.02% 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid and 0.01% 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of <b>fatty</b> acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of <b>fatty</b> acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. <b>Fatty</b> acids are made by <b>fatty</b> acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the <b>fatty</b> acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of <b>fatty</b> acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these <b>fatty</b> acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway.

5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential <b>fatty</b> acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 <b>fatty</b> acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 <b>fatty</b> acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these <b>fatty</b> acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 <b>fatty</b> acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 <b>fatty</b> acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} <b>fatty</b> acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated <b>fatty</b> acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential <b>fatty</b> acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated <b>fatty</b> acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free <b>fatty</b> acid content.|$|E
5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the <b>fatty</b> acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from <b>fatty</b> acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize <b>fatty</b> acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E

5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} <b>fatty</b> acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, <b>fatty</b> acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of <b>fatty</b> acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the <b>fatty</b> acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain <b>fatty</b> acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E

5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free <b>fatty</b> {{acids and}} glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the <b>fatty</b> acids are {{broken down by}} beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. <b>Fatty</b> acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fatty</b> acids, or <b>fatty</b> acid {{residues}} {{when they}} are part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called <b>fatty</b> acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The <b>fatty</b> acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a <b>fatty</b> acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the <b>fatty</b> acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring <b>fatty</b> acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
