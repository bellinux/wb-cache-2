25|$|The {{next day}} the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>research</b> into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done {{to find out if}} the illness was common or if something should be done about it. Not until 2008 when a young woman died just a few days after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists think that at least one of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment is to give the patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>research</b> in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like sheep meat and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E
