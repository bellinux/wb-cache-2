40|$|Lowry's {{controversial}} and enigmatic book has spawned diverse critical analyses geared toward {{arriving at a}} single understanding of the novel; however, what too many of these works fail {{to take into account}} is the eclectic nature of Lowry's techniques as well as his themes. Hence, though we usually get a very clear picture of one approach to the book in these individual exercises in explication, when we turn once again to the story itself, we are apt to be a bit confused as to exactly how the design that they offer governs the unity of the book. Therefore, in order to glean the author's intent, one must take a more comprehensive, a rhetorical, view of the piece. For future reference, chapter one [...] "A Review of Criticism" -summarizes and evaluates book reviews and critical studies done on Under the Volcano, the critical studies being organized into source, theme and technique analyses, respectively,Chapter two, "Rhetorical Analysis Defined," considers the critical theories of Edward Corbett, Mark Schorer and Wayne Booth to adumbrate the notion that a rhetorical analysis addresses the writer's intent, his work and thee work's impact upon its aud 4 ence {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a piece of literature. As an illustration, Lowry's essay "Garden of Etla" is explicated rhetorically here. In chapter three, "A Rhetorical Analysis of Under the Volcano," a chapter-by-chapter, detailed approach to the novel is used in order to illuminate the techniques which promote and define Lowry's themes. The techniques include those that establish stream of consciousness (interior monologues and dialogues), those that determine its direction (syntax, time and space montage, and mechanical devices) and those that add depth and dimension (figures of speech, puns and distorted English). The last chapter, "Malcolm Lowry's 'Design-Governing Postures,," examines unifying structures which range the entire book and which thereby impose order on it. These designs include Lowry's use of the traditional unities, leitmotifs, parodies, symbolic structures, formal arrangements and "cyclic" themes. Critics of the novel contend that though enjoying isolated moments of direction and lucidness, Under the Volcano fails to convey it purpose effectively because the themes are nebulous and because the techniques segment rather than solidify the story. By explicating the book rhetorically, however, one learns to understand and appreciate the techniques that Lowry <b>employs</b> <b>to</b> <b>amplify</b> the fragmentation endured by the Consul, the people closest to him and, in fact, the entire world around him.

The gene amoB showed the highest sequence variability of the three amo genes, suggesting that it might be a better molecular marker than the most frequently used amoA to resolve closely related AOB species. To test the suitability of using the amoCAB genes for community studies, a strategy involving nested PCR was <b>employed.</b> Primers <b>to</b> <b>amplify</b> the whole amoCAB operon and each individual gene were tested.

The nested PCR approach provides a possibility to increase the sensitivity of detection of amo genes in samples with low abundance of AOB. It also allows the amplification of the almost complete amoA gene, with about 300 bp more sequence information than the previous approaches. The coupled study of all three amo genes and the intergenic spacer regions that are under different selection pressure might allow a more detailed analysis of the evolutionary processes, which are responsible for the differentiation of AOB communities in different habitats...|$|R

Previous studies have identified the alternative splicing of amelogenin in many mammalian vertebrates as one mechanism for amelogenin heterogeneous expression in teeth. While amelogenin and its splicing forms in mammalian vertebrates have been cloned and sequenced, the amelogenin gene, especially its splicing forms in non-mammalian species, remains largely unknown. To better understand the mechanism underlying amelogenin evolution, we previously cloned and characterized an amelogenin gene sequence from a squamate, the green iguana. In this study, we <b>employed</b> RT-PCR <b>to</b> <b>amplify</b> the amelogenin gene from the black spiny-tailed iguana Ctenosaura similis teeth, and discovered a novel splicing form of the amelogenin gene. The transcript of the newly identified iguana amelogenin gene (named C. Similis-T 2 L) is 873 nucleotides long encoding an expected polypeptide of 206 amino acids. The C.

In the envelope gene, mutations encoded scattered amino acid changes that did not cluster into clearly definable variable regions; however, characterization of these terminal variant sequences revealed a predominance of G-to-A and A-to-G nucleotide substitutions. Additionally, some cats harbored variants with recombinant subgroup B-like envelope genes, while the major variant from one cat had a 12 -bp insertion in a region previously characterized as an immunodeficiency-inducing determinant. Finally, proviruses from tumor DNA frequently possessed envelope genes predicted to encode a protein truncated in the N-terminal half because of either premature termination codons or deletions ranging from 29 to 1, 666 bp. In contrast, all envelope genes cloned from the bone marrow of one cat were predicted to encode full-length envelope product, and only a minority of proviral clones from a cat that did not develop a tumor had defective envelope genes.

For example, in 1994, Irving Kirsch characterised hypnosis as a [...] "nondeceptive placebo", i.e., a method that openly makes use of suggestion and <b>employs</b> methods <b>to</b> <b>amplify</b> its effects. In Trance on Trial, a 1989 text directed at the legal profession, legal scholar Alan W. Scheflin and psychologist Jerrold Lee Shapiro observed that the [...] "deeper" [...] the hypnotism, the more likely a particular characteristic is to appear, and the greater extent to which it is manifested. Scheflin and Shapiro identified 20 separate characteristics that hypnotized subjects might display: [...] "dissociation"; [...] "detachment"; [...] "suggestibility", [...] "ideosensory activity"; [...] "catalepsy"; [...] "ideomotor responsiveness"; [...] "age regression"; [...] "revivification"; [...] "hypermnesia"; [...] "or suggested amnesia"; [...] "posthypnotic responses"; [...] "hypnotic analgesia and anesthesia"; [...] "glove anesthesia"; [...] "somnambulism"; [...] "automatic writing"; [...] "time distortion"; [...] "release of inhibitions"; [...] "change in capacity for volitional activity"; [...] "trance logic"; and [...] "effortless imagination".|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} use of novel “sloppy ” {{molecular}} beacon probes in homogeneous PCR screening assays in which thermal denaturation of the resulting probe-amplicon hybrids provides a characteristic set of amplicon melting temperature (Tm) values that identify which species is present in a sample. Sloppy molecular beacons possess relatively long probe sequences, enabling them to form hybrids with amplicons from many different species {{despite the presence of}} mismatched base pairs. By using four sloppy molecular beacons, each possessing a different probe sequence and each labeled with a differently colored fluorophore, four different Tm values can be determined simultaneously. We tested this technique with 27 different species of mycobacteria and found that each species generates a unique, highly reproducible signature that is unaffected by the initial bacterial DNA concentration. Utilizing this general paradigm, screening assays can be designed for the identification {{of a wide range of}} species. A classic approach for determining the identity of a bacterial species is <b>to</b> <b>employ</b> PCR <b>to</b> exponentially <b>amplify</b> a selected segment of a 16 S rRNA gene (26), utilizing a pair of “universal primers ” that bind to highly conserved sequences at the ends of the target region, and to then use a sophisticated technique t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{iterative}} {{equalization scheme}} for suppressing intrachannel nonlinearities in high-speed optical transmission systems operating at 40 Gb/s is presented. The proposed method employs a noise-predictive filter {{to mitigate the}} colored noise due <b>to</b> <b>amplified</b> spontaneous emission noise and optical filtering. The maximum a posteriori probability symbol detection implemented as the Bahl–Cocke–Jelinek–Raviv (BCJR) algorithm is <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> suppress the intrachannel nonlinear effects. Soft decision outputs provided by the noise-predictive BCJR equalizer are processed by an iterative low-density parity-check decoder. Index Terms—Bahl–Cocke–Jelinek–Raviv (BCJR) algorithm, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, noise-predictive filter, optical communications. I...|$|R
