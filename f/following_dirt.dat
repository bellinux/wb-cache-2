40|$|Extract] We {{arrived at}} midday after <b>following</b> an obscure <b>dirt</b> track {{somewhere in the}} middle of Sonora, Mexico. The plan was to find the cave with the help of some {{coordinates}} I had grabbed from a scientific paper. After arriving at the spot using the latest in technology at the time, a bulky hand-held GPS, the three of us looked around. We were standing on flat, low ground containing desert scrub, and could see around us fairly well. The nearest hill rose just a little above the horizon...|$|R

The force was ordered to capture a Hizbullah post and {{to take control of}} the exit roads from the town, in case the abducted soldiers were still there. Only 70 meters into Lebanese territory, a Merkava heavy battle tank drove over a remote-controlled mine. The tank was destroyed and its four crewmen were killed instantly, and the mission to capture the access roads to the town was quickly abandoned. Hizbullah fire prevented the extraction of the destroyed tank and the remains of the four soldiers just inside Lebanese territory for several days. A fifth soldier was killed and two soldiers wounded in the effort. Defence Minister Amir Peretz, who watched the tank exploding live on his monitor, was stunned. It was later described as the [...] "Zidane effect" [...] that cemented Israel's resolve towards going to war.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about memory and about narrative, {{both of which}} are {{concerned}} with what is missing. It explores the ways that the events in our individual lives, our collective lives, become history and narrative. The paper considers writer Thomas King’s work on narrative, and Walter Benjamin’s work on memory as theatre. Many of the stories included here are personal. They might have been heard at kitchen tables, or on the phone from family and friends. Some stories are ones which I can’t recall not knowing. The paper poses questions such as how these things become important to our present. Whether and why it is important to remember, and what constitutes authenticity in memory. The narrative structure of the paper reflects these concerns, by highlighting spaces and absences. To an extent the structure manifested itself organically, as a result of attempts to provide an honest articulation of the questions and ideas which have impacted on my material practice. This {{has proven to be a}} delicate task, as it attempts to speak to a material practice that is ongoing, constantly changing. There are overlaps in the form and content of each but there is also a space in between. My modus operandi resists full disclosure. I have this image of myself, like I am in the backyard, in the dirt, excavating some things burying others. From a certain vantage point all you see is the upturned soil <b>following</b> me, <b>dirt</b> under my nails. Personal, noncommercial use of this item is permitted...|$|R
