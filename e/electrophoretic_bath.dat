40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sample resistivity is the controlling factor in electrokinetic impregnation was substantiated. Experiments show that dense clay- bonded silicon carbide can be impregnated {{beneath the surface}} pores whereas only surface pore impregnation is achieved with both dense and porous graphite. The resistivity of the materials differ {{by a factor of}} about 1 O/sup 10 /. Although deep penetration of the substrate by the particles of the coating system is not achieved during deposition, there is evidence of considerable diffusion of the binder-carbide solid solution into the pores of the graphite after sintering. A number of sintered, crack-free, and adherent TaC coatings on ATJ graphite panels were prepared which showed evidence of surface pore penetration. The attainment of satisfactory reproducibility was difficult because of preferential deposition of the binder metal and contamination from erosion of the chrome-manganese steel ball mill. Efforts to prevent contamination by lining the mill with rubber were unsatisfactory. A silicon carbide liner for the mill was ordered and will be received in December. To prevent preferential deposition, precoating of the tantalum carbide particles with nickel by chemical precipitation and electroless nickel plating was investigated. Nickel coatings were obtained by both techniques; however, the chemically precipitated nickel was not adherent when the coated particles were placed in the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>bath.</b> Good adherence was obtained by electroless plating; but this material, when sintered, cracked during the cooling cycle. Further investigation established that both iron and nickel are required as binders to obtain well-sintered Tar. Work was begun on the preparation of coated rocket nozzle liners for testing at NOL. Graphite nozzles were machined to the WM-D- 800 - 2 configuration, and a cell was designed for obtaiining a uniform electrophoretic deposit. Test coatings were within the required thickness tolerance of plus or minus 0. 002 in. The coatings, thus far, have cracked {{at the edge of the}} nozzle throat during the heat-up cycle. This is believed to result from a temperature differential in the furnace and from improper control of the binder composition. The furnace is being modified to minimize the temperature gradient, and variability in the binder composition will be eliminated when the carbide liner is installed in the ball mill. Thermal shock tests were performed on coated graphite panels. The specimens were plunged into a 2500 deg C zone, held at temperature for 2 min, and then removed from the hot zone. Microscopic examination of the coating after testing indicated no ill effects. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{integrate}} a material {{with a high}} permeability on chip, allows for magnetically coupled circuits and structures to be designed and incorporated along side CMOS circuitry. Devices ranging from A. C. transformers to magnetically driven MEMS structures can be designed and fabricated. Desirable characteristics of magnetic cores for integrated inductors and transformers are first high saturation flux {{in order to obtain}} high saturation current; high permeability to obtain high inductance; high resistivity to reduce eddy current loss at high frequencies and compatible deposition and patterning processes. High frequency magnetic materials are oxide based ceramics and are therefore difficult to evaporate, sputter, plate and selectively etched. ElectroPhoretic Deposition (EPD) is a method where insulating particles are imparted charge in a suspension and are made to deposit on an electrode by applying electric field. EPD has been extensively employed in depositing oxide based phosphors for display applications. In this study, ferrite particles have been prepared by grinding sintered toroids and deposited by EPD. The <b>electrophoretic</b> solution <b>bath</b> is composed of isopropyl alcohol with traces of Mg(N 03) 2 and La(N 03) 3 salts. Glycerol is added to the solution bath as a surfactant to promote increased substrate adhesion. The dissociation of magnesium nitrate in the solution bath charges the ferrite particles. An electric field of ~ 50 - 160 V/cm is applied with negative terminal connected to the wafer to be plated and aluminum electrode is used as the anode. The deposition process is found to be self limiting with the initial high elerophoretic current declining to 10 % of its value in 10 minutes. The deposition rate and zeta potential measurements indicate a high particle velocity on the order 5. 7 x 10 - 3 cm/s with an electric field of 160 V/cm generated across the 2 cm electrode spacing. Pattern filling and conformal coverage in copper damascene planar microinductors has been investigated. A method to extracted permeability from S 11 impedance analysis has been employed. It has been found that grinding process deteriorates magnetic response. With recent advances in magnetic particle technology for high frequency materials, these results enable unique hard and soft powder ferrite material to be selectively deposited in wide variety of CMOS and MEMâ€™s based applications...|$|R
