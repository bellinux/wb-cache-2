OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for manganese exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3mg/m3. At levels of 500mg/m3, manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

2500|$|... (1992) The authors made {{a review}} of the {{researches}} of RPE efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b> This article shows {{a significant difference between the}} real and lab efficiencies, that forced to carry out researches of respirators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces,</b> and develop adequate terminology. The article also describes the problems when evaluating the protective properties of the high efficiency RPE types: very low pollution of air under the facepiece preventing the accurate analysis; and it is difficult to find a workplace with a sufficiently high concentration of air pollution.|$|R
50|$|Studies of respirator's {{performance}} {{was carried out}} not very often, {{and almost all of}} these studies were conducted in USA (and UK). It is possible that the lack of information about <b>the</b> RPD efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces,</b> was <b>the</b> reason behind developing these assigned PF in several European countries, whose values differ significantly from the evidence-based values of APFs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and UK.Most European countries (except UK) did not conduct very complex and expensive studies on the effectiveness of respirators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces,</b> or spent very little of such research. Therefore, it may be that some countries do not take full account of results of foreign researches (that showed {{a significant difference between the}} effectiveness of respirators in a laboratory environment; and in applying them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces).</b> For example, after <b>the</b> study <b>in</b> 1990, <b>the</b> APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997) in UK.

Examples of uses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> include attorneys responding to clients, medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams, and managers approving employee requests.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial stage}} of {{research}} yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology {{to describe the}} protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation should set limits {{for the use of}} all types of respirators based on their performance, measured not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplaces.</b> <b>The</b> first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of respirators is the most unreliable method of protecting workers from all known methods. Therefore, respirators should be used only when other methods can not be used; or when other methods can not reduce the exposure of air pollution on people to an acceptable safe level.|$|R

5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E

Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.
