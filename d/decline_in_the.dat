40|$|Price deflators for {{semiconductors}} fell rapidly {{over the}} 1990 s, pulled down by steep <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deflator for the microprocessor (MPU) segment that accelerated around 1995. A decomposition of a price index for Intel's MPUs suggests {{that virtually all}} of <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> price index [...] and the acceleration [...] {{can be attributed to}} quality increases associated with product innovation, rather than <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cost per chip. <b>The</b> sizable <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Intel's margins from 1993 [...] 99 only accounted for about 6 percentage points of the average 24 % <b>decline</b> per quarter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> price index and cannot explain the acceleration.

5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former and a 33% <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{trends in}} social capital since 1952 and assess {{explanations for the}} observed declines. We examine both social capital centered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home and argue that <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> social capital has been over-stated. Controlling for education, there have been small <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> probability of volunteering, larger <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> group membership, and still larger <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> probability of entertaining since the 1970 s. There have been no <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> probability of spending frequent evenings with friends or relatives, {{but there have been}} decreases in daily visits with friends or relatives. Rising community heterogeneity (particularly income inequality) explains <b>the</b> fall <b>in</b> social capital produced outside the home whereas <b>the</b> rise <b>in</b> women's labor force participation rates explains <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> social capital produced within the home. ...|$|R

5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but went into a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led to a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses {{through most of the}} twentieth century.

5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{influence of}} family background, including socioeconomic and social background variables on educational attainment in Australia for cohorts born between 1890 and 1982. We test hypotheses from modernization theory on sibling data using random effects models and find: (i) substantial <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> influence of family background on educational attainment (indicated by the sibling intraclass correlations); (ii) <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effects of {{both economic and}} cultural socioeconomic background variables; (iii) changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effects of some social background variables (e. g., family size); (iv) and <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extent that socioeconomic and social background factors account for variation in educational attainment. Unmeasured family background factors are more important, and proportionally increasingly so, for educational attainment than the measured socioeconomic and social background factors analyzed. Fixed effects models showed steeper <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effects of socioeconomic background variables than in standard analyses suggesting that unmeasured family factors associated with socioeconomic background obscure {{the full extent of}} the decline...|$|R

The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
