5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported {{as far away as}} Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent {{at the end of the}} 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Melchior Balassa, one of {{the wealthiest}} lords in John Sigismund's realm, deserted to Ferdinand in December 1561. John Sigismund moved to seize Balassa's domains, but his army was routed at Hadad (now Hodod in Romania) on 4 March 1562. Stirred up by Balassa, the Székely commoners rose to restore their ancient liberties (including <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes),</b> which had been {{restricted}} in the 1550s. John Sigismund's army routed them in May, and their leaders were impaled or mutilated. The Diet adopted new laws to restrict the privileges of the Székelys, including a ban on the employment of commoners as jurors. Two new royal castles named Székelytámad ("Székely-assault") and Székelybánja ("Székely-regret") were erected in the Székely Land. After Balassa's revolt, most counties outside Transylvania changed allegiance from John Sigismund to Ferdinand. To persuade Ferdinand to renounce the counties, John Sigismund even offered not to style himself king, but this was rejected in July 1562.|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, Emperor Francis I {{was forced}} to convene the Hungarian Diet, which inaugurated a Reform Period.

25|$|Under the Kings of France {{the nobles}} of Brittany {{continued}} {{to enjoy the}} privileges that had been accorded them by the various independent Dukes of Brittany. Brittany's Celtic legal traditions were maintained, to a degree, and the Estates of Brittany and the Parlement of Brittany were kept separate from the French parliamentary system in Paris. The Breton noble privileges protected in this parliamentary system included <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes,</b> representation in the Breton Parlement, {{and the maintenance of}} Breton titles {{in the tradition of the}} Duchy rather than that of France, including, in theory, the application of Brittany's form of semi-Salic, rather than pure Salic Law to the succession issues.|$|E
25|$|Mining was revived {{somewhat}} in the 1880s, when liberal reforms made {{foreign investment in}} mining interesting. A key factor in this revival was the activity of Washington S. Valentine's New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC), which had expanded rapidly and had become a major {{economic and political power}} within Honduras, not only in silver mining, but in railroad building (the InterOceanic Railroad). Owing in part to the company's efforts, the Honduran government had allowed foreign mining companies to operate in Honduras with a minimum of restrictions and a virtual <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes.</b> By 1889 the company was annually shipping bullion with a value of over US$700,000 to the United States. Profits from this operation were extremely high; the company's dividends {{for the first half of}} 1889 totaled US$150,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the proposed radical changes began with the Protests of the Parlement of Paris addressed to Louis XVI in March 1776, in which the Second Estate, the nobility, resisted the {{beginning of}} certain reforms that would remove their privileges, notably their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes.</b> The objections made to the Parlement of Paris were {{in reaction to the}} essay, Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses ("Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth") by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. The Second Estate reacted to the essay with anger to convince the king that the nobility still served a very important role and still deserved the same privileges of tax exemption {{as well as for the}} preservation of the guilds and corporations put in place to restrict trade, both of which were eliminated in the reforms proposed by Turgot.|$|E

25|$|The Cedula of Population of 1783 {{laid the}} {{foundation}} and growth {{of the population of}} Trinidad. The island's Spanish possessors contributed little towards advancements, with El Dorado the focus; Trinidad's geographical location made it the center of that focus. Following the Cedula, French planters (accompanied by their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos) from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to the Trinidad. This exodus was encouraged due to the French Revolution. The Spanish also gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> for 10 years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. These new immigrants established local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. Trinidad's population jumped from less than 1,400 in 1777, to over 15,000 by the end of 1789. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population.|$|E
25|$|In 1572, {{the city}} {{sided with the}} Dutch revolt against Spanish rule and played an {{important}} role in the Eighty Years' War. Besieged from May until October 1574 by the Spanish, Leiden was relieved by the cutting of the dikes, thus enabling ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants of the flooded town. As a reward for the heroic defence of the previous year, the University of Leiden was founded by William I of Orange in 1575. Yearly on 3 October, the end of the siege is still celebrated in Leiden. Tradition tells that the citizens were offered the choice between a university and a certain <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and chose the university. The siege is notable also for being the first instance in Europe of the issuance of paper money, with paper taken from prayer books being stamped using coin dies when silver ran out.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish gave many {{incentives}} to lure settlers to the island, including <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> {{for ten years}} and land grants in accordance to the terms {{set out in the}} Cedula. In 1783, the proclamation of a Cedula of Population by the Spanish Crown granted 32 acres (129,000 m²) of land to each Roman Catholic who settled in Trinidad and half as much for each slave that they brought. Uniquely, 16 acres (65,000 m²) was offered to each Free Coloured or Free Person of Colour (gens de couleur libre, as they were later known), and half as much for each slave they brought. French planters with their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos from neighboring islands of Grenada, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Dominica migrated to the Trinidad during the French Revolution. These new immigrants establishing local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. This resulted in Trinidad having the unique feature of a large French-speaking Free Coloured slave-owning class.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent {{personally}} mounted {{an expedition}} in 1537 that destroyed or captured many surrounding villages {{but did not}} manage to subdue the area. The Ottomans {{found it necessary to}} compromise with the inhabitants by giving them a series of privileges: local self-government, the right to bear arms, <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes,</b> the right to sail under their own flag into any Ottoman port and to provide military service in time of war. However, despite the privileges, the Himariotes revolted during the following conflicts: Ottoman–Venetian War (1537–40), Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–73), Morean War (1684–99), Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18) and the Russo-Turkish wars of the 18th century. On the other hand, Ottoman reprisals depopulated the area and led to forced Islamizations which finally limited the area's Christian population by the 18th century to the town of Himarë and six villages. Additionally the Himariotes were often attacked by the Labs, a nearby Albanian tribe, on the grounds of race and religion. In one occasion, in 1577, the chieftains of Himarë appealed to the Pope for arms and supplies promising to fight the Ottomans. They also promised to transfer their religious allegiance to Rome, provided that they will retain their Eastern Orthodox liturgical customs since {{the majority of the population}} was Greek and didn't understand the Frankish language.|$|E
25|$|His ecumenical gifts were {{widespread}} and often exuberant. Commonly held land was given, along with <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> {{as well as}} relics. Christ Church was probably given rights at the important port of Sandwich as well as tax exemption, with confirmation in the placement of their charters on the altar, while it got the relics of St Ælfheah, at the displeasure {{of the people of}} London. Another see in the king's favour was Winchester, second only to the Canterbury see in terms of wealth. New Minster's Liber Vitae records Cnut as a benefactor of the monastery, and the Winchester Cross, with 500 marks of silver and 30 marks of gold, as well as relics of various saints was given to it. Old Minster was the recipient of a shrine for the relics of St Birinus and the probable confirmation of its privileges. The monastery at Evesham, with its Abbot Ælfweard purportedly a relative of the king through Ælfgifu the Lady (probably Ælfgifu of Northampton, rather than Queen Emma, also known as Ælfgifu), got the relics of St Wigstan. Such generosity towards his subjects, which his skalds called destroying treasure, was of course popular with the English. Yet {{it is important to remember}} that not all Englishmen were in his favour, and the burden of taxation was widely felt. His attitude towards London's see was clearly not benign. The monasteries at Ely and Glastonbury were apparently not on good terms either.|$|E
500|$|The heavily taxed Shia {{were desperate}} {{to get rid of}} the tribal regime and {{together}} with Major Daly claimed to be victims of corruption, mismanagement as well as [...] "atrocities and oppression". The opposing faction rejected the reforms on the basis that equity and standardization of law would remove their advantages such as <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and sovereignty over estates. A series of pro and anti reform petitions were submitted by the two factions to different British officials including the Foreign Office. However, the situation remained unchanged for two years as the British were hesitating.|$|E

500|$|Andrew {{employed}} Jews and Muslims {{to administer}} royal revenues, which caused a discord between Andrew and the Holy See {{starting in the}} early 1220s. Pope Honorius urged Andrew and Queen Yolanda to prohibit Muslims from employing Christians. Andrew confirmed the privileges of clergymen, including their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and their right to be exclusively judged by church courts, but also prohibited the consecration of udvornici, castle folk and other serfs in early 1222. However, a new conflict emerged between Andrew and the Holy See after he persuaded Béla to separate from his wife, Maria Laskarina. An [...] "immense crowd" [...] approached Andrew around June 1222, demanding [...] "grave and unjust things", according to a letter of Pope Honorius. [...] Actually, the royal servantswho were landowners directly subject to the monarch's power and obliged {{to fight in the}} royal armyassembled, forcing Andrew to dismiss Julius Kán and his other officials. Andrew was also forced issue a royal charter, the Golden Bull of 1222. The charter summarized the liberties of the royal servants, including their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and the jurisdiction of the ispáns. The last clause of the Golden Bull authorized [...] "the bishops {{as well as the other}} barons and nobles of the realm, singularly and in common" [...] to resist the monarch if he did not honor the provisions of the charter. The Golden Bull clearly distinguished the royal servants from the king's other subjects, which led to the rise of the Hungarian nobility. [...] The Golden Bull is commonly compared with England's Magna Carta — a similar charter which was sealed a few years earlier in 1215. [...] A significant difference between them is that, in England, the settlement strengthened the position of all the royal subjects but, in Hungary, the aristocracy came to dominate both the crown and the lower orders.|$|E
500|$|Sandsfoot Castle {{was built}} to protect the Weymouth Bay anchorage, being placed on cliffs {{overlooking}} the waterway, opposite Portland Castle on the other side. Sandsfoot was a blockhouse, intended to defeat enemy ships using a battery of heavy artillery, and had minimal protection against an attack from the land. It was completed by 1541, run by a captain appointed by the Crown, and cost £3,887 to build. There was probably an early agreement that the nearby village of Wyke Regis had a responsibility to support the castle, and in exchange they came to traditionally enjoy an <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and militia duties. The antiquarian John Leland visited the castle soon after its construction, describing it as [...] "a right goodlie and warlyke castle" [...] with [...] "one open barbican", probably referring to the castle's gun platform.|$|E
500|$|The city {{became the}} {{administrative}} {{centre of the}} Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana. It remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40–44AD led by one of Ptolemy's freedmen, Aedemon, and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten-year <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes.</b> The city was raised {{to the status of}} a municipium and its system of governance was overhauled, with the Punic-style suffetes replaced by annually elected duumvirs, or pairs of magistrates. However, the city's position was always tenuous; it was located on the south-eastern edge of the province, facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes. A ring of five forts located at the modern hamlets of Aïn Schkor, Bled el Gaada, Sidi Moussa, Sidi Said and Bled Takourart (ancient Tocolosida) were constructed to bolster the city's defence. Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata, an auxiliary cavalry unit from Gaul, while Aïn Schkor housed Spanish and Belgic cohorts. Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of Parthians, and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at Toscolosida. Rising tensions in the region {{near the end of the}} 2nd century led the emperor Marcus Aurelius to order the construction of a [...] circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers. Volubilis was connected by road to Lixus and Tingis (modern Tangier) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of Mauretania Caesariensis, as the territory of the Berber Baquates tribe lay in between.|$|E

2500|$|Muhammad bin Tughlaq died in 1351 {{while trying}} to chase and punish people in Gujarat who were rebelling against the Delhi Sultanate. He was succeeded by Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), who tried to regain the old kingdom {{boundary}} by waging a war with Bengal for 11 months in 1359. However, Bengal did not fall. Firuz Shah ruled for 37 years. His reign attempted to stabilize the food supply and reduce famines by commissioning an irrigation canal from the Yamuna river. An educated sultan, Firuz Shah left a memoir. In it he wrote that he banned the practice of torture, such as amputations, tearing out of eyes, sawing people alive, crushing people's bones as punishment, pouring molten lead into throats, setting people on fire, driving nails into hands and feet, among others. He also wrote {{that he did not}} tolerate attempts by Rafawiz Shia Muslim and Mahdi sects from proselytizing people into their faith, nor did he tolerate Hindus who tried to rebuild temples that his armies had destroyed. As punishment for proselytizing, Firuz Shah put many Shias, Mahdi, and Hindus to death (siyasat). Firuz Shah Tughlaq also lists his accomplishments to include converting Hindus to Sunni Islam by announcing an <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and jizya for those who convert, and by lavishing new converts with presents and honours. Simultaneously, he raised taxes and jizya, assessing it at three levels, and stopping the practice of his predecessors who had historically exempted all Hindu Brahmins from the jizya. [...] He also vastly expanded the number of slaves in his service and those of Muslim nobles. The reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq was marked by reduction in extreme forms of torture, eliminating favours to select parts of society, but also increased intolerance and persecution of targeted groups.|$|E
