Curs: 2015 / 2016 The role of {{corrective}} feedback (CF, henceforth) in second language acquisition (SLA, henceforth), more specifically written {{corrective feedback}} (WCF, henceforth), has been highly studied {{in the last couple}} of decades (Truscott, 1996; 1999; Ferris, 1999; Ashwell, 2000; Chandler, 2003; Russell & Spada, 2006; Sheen, 2010; 2011; Ellis & Shintani, 2014 among others). In fact, in the past years there has been an increase in the number of studies addressing this issue (Storch, 2010). Even though the role of written correction in SLA was often shaded by the importance of oral CF, it has recently gained strength and is now an aspect of language learning worth of research. From the above mentioned studies, most of them discussed the importance of WCF in relation to the efficacy in learners’ grammatical improvement and made a comparison of different WCF techniques. Even though much debate continues on these issues and further research is needed, another relevant issue which could provide vital insight to this topic is learners’ perceptions and preferences. Already stated by Olajedo (1993), learners’ views are neglected but, in fact, they should be considered and compared with the opinions of teachers. Among the first studies to tackle this aspect, we can find Radecki and Swales (1988), Olajedo (1993) and Saito (1994). Some years later, Lee (2004; 2005), Chiang (2004), Diab (2005; 2006), Plonsky and Mills (2006), Montgomery and Baker (2007), Mahfoodh (2011) and Norouzian (2012) have also analysed learners’ preferences, perceptions, attitudes and emotional reactions. A study conducted by <b>Hamouda</b> (<b>2011),</b> which paid attention to learners and teachers and the comparison between these two groups, has thrown interesting findings related to similarities and differences of perception within the same classroom. This project is organised in two different parts. Part 1 focuses on the theoretical framework behind the research in which key concepts and notions will be explained. It begins with the notion of error, its nature, typology and implications from a pedagogical perspective. After that, the definition of CF will be presented for later going in depth with WCF and the different types of techniques which could be employed for written correction. Part 1 concludes with a detailed literature review of relevant research conducted in relation to WCF and grammatical accuracy by making reference to the debate on this topic. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of different WCF techniques will be mentioned. Finally, research carried out in relation to learners’ preferences and perceptions on WCF will be presented. As for Part 2, it consists of the study leading this project. The first section describes the research questions and hypotheses derived from previous research. The methodology section will present the setting in which the research took place, the participants involved in the study, the instruments employed and how data were analysed. Finally, results will be shown together with a discussion of such data. The project will conclude with some final remarks and suggestions of the future direction WCF studies should take, along with the limitations emerging from the study conducted...|$|E

PAPER 6 : V. Alipour Tabrizy and A. A. Hamouda, 2012 : Evaluation of asphaltene stability during CO 2 flooding at different miscible conditions and presence of light components. Being submitted for publication in journal. The thesis addresses oil recovery by miscible CO 2 flooding from modified sandstone and chalk rocks. Calcite mineral surface is modified with stearic acid (SA) and asphaltene, and the silicate mineral surfaces are modified with N,N-dimethyldodecylamine (NN-DMDA) and asphaltene. The stability of adsorbed polar components in presence of SO 4 2 - and Mg 2 + ions is also investigated. Recovery from sandstone cores is consistently lower than that from chalk cores saturated with the same oil and flooded with CO 2 at all miscible flooding conditions. This {{may be due to the}} larger permeability contrasts in sandstone cores, which promote the fingering phenomenon. Miscible CO 2 flooding for chalk and sandstone cores with distilled water, as initial water saturation, shows also lower oil recovery than cores saturated with different ions. At higher miscible flooding conditions, higher oil recovery is obtained. However, presence of light components (such as C 1 or C 3) in oil reduced the recovery. Oil recovery in presence of methane (C 1) is lower than that in presence of methane and propane (C 1 /C 3). A ternary diagram was constructed in order to understand the CO 2 flooding mechanism(s) at the different flooding conditions and in presence of light components. The side effect of the flooding with CO 2 is the probability for asphaltene deposition. An approach based on solubility parameter in the liquid, is used to assess the risk for asphaltene deposition during CO 2 miscible flooding. The light components (C 1 /C 3) and higher flooding conditions enhanced the risk for asphaltene instability. It is also shown higher amount of asphaltene deposition in chalk cores than that in sandstone cores at similar miscibility conditions...|$|E
