The procedure {{is shown to}} fit the observations for different freeway, tunnel and arterial data, thus demonstrating its flexibility in terms of representing different types of roads. Furthermore, the procedure also provides a fit that is reasonable all data regimes, unlike many other single regime models that only fit free-flow or forced flow conditions data. Finally, this single-regime model provides a quality of fit {{that is consistent with}} most multi-regime models, without the need to deal with the complexities associated with the selection of regime break points. In addition to demonstrating the fit of the model to well known sample data from a standard traffic <b>flow</b> <b>text</b> books, fits to three different recent data sets with 1 to 5 minute loop detector data are also presented. These fits demonstrate that the flexibility of the proposed technique to deal with real-time data for both Europe and North America. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} social media offers {{a wide range}} of {{research}} topics not least concerning information retrieval tasks. While numerous publications have adressed tasks such as opinion mining, sentiment analysis or domain-specific feature extraction in order to gain information about real world events, sentiments of participants in extremist forums or to improve information filtering, less attention has been payed on opinions, sentiments or features of an entire social media group. Moreover, the determination of the aim of such a group could leverage the exposure of extremist or riot groups. For this purpose a method for automated aim determination of a social media group is presented. As a first step a research on related building blocks is conducted. On this basis a literature survey on valuable publications is presented. Supplementary to common formats of survey papers a structured table is provided, which gives an overview on the examined resources. For each resource listed in the table a corresponding <b>flow</b> <b>text</b> outlines its specific content. This survey then functions as a baseline for the proposed aim determination method. Furthermore, emerging method requirements are depicted and a framework architecture is suggested. The method is evaluated by the means of existing approaches of the requirements, which emerge within the scope of the method. Finally, a method is established as a profound basis for further research...|$|E

The key observation behind Iustitia is that <b>text</b> <b>flows</b> have the lowest entropy and encrypted flows have the highest entropy, while the entropy of binary flows stands in between. The basic idea of Iustitia is to classify flows using machine learning techniques where a feature is the entropy of every certain number of consecutive bytes. The key features of Iustitia are high speed (10 % of average packet inter-arrival time) and high accuracy (86 %) ...|$|R
