5000|$|Due to {{the early}} {{practice}} of marshalling by dividing the marshalled arms {{through the middle of}} the charge (called [...] "dimidiation"), some charges took on the appearance of being themselves divided, such as the arms of Hochtaunuskreis. Even as marshalling per pale (<b>charges</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact</b> and are shifted to accommodate the division of the shield) supplanted dimidiation, some marshalled arms retained some aspects of dimidiation, yielding a half eagle {{on one side and a}} whole lion on the other in some cases, such as the arms of Goslar. Similarly, when the crosier was incorporated into the arms of Biberach, the result was the dexter half of an imperial eagle and, in the sinister half of the shield, a (whole) crosier.|$|R
40|$|The spin {{transport}} {{properties of}} two dimensional electron gases with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a perpendicular magnetic field was discussed. The {{spin orbit coupling}} competes with Zeeman splitting to introduce additional degeneracies between different Landau level at certain magnetic fields. It was observed that identical quantum Hall effect was observed whether the Rashba coupling is present or not. The results show that when the level crossing occurs near the Fermi level, the spin Hall conductance becomes divergent, while the <b>charge</b> Hall conductance <b>remain</b> <b>intact.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Yeast {{flocculation}} {{is governed}} by the competition between electrostatic repulsion (nonspecific interaction) and polysaccharide-protein bonds (specific interaction). The electrical surface potential, which is mainly due to phosphodiester linkages (of the cell wall phosphomannan), maintains the cells dispersed. Polysaccharides and proteins of the cell surface can readily penetrate the potential barrier and may establish specific bonds. The specific inhibition of flocculation by various mannosyl derivatives suggested that the protein receptor binds to the group Man alpha [...] 3 Man alpha [...] PO 4 - [...] 6 Man alpha [...] 2 Man alpha [...] . of phosphomannan. Calcium, which is required for flocculation, could act as {{a bridge between the}} negatively charged groups of phosphomannan and those of the protein receptor. The role of calcium, however, cannot be restricted only to charge neutralization because other divalent cations inhibit flocculation; our results show that cation binding {{is governed by}} strong stereochemical constraints. Studies on protein-polysaccharide interactions have shown that <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> may <b>remain</b> uncompensated at short distance, but can be stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Calcium could induce a "locked" conformation of the receptor; this conformation is the only one capable of binding phosphomannan strongly enough to make cell adhesion possible...|$|R
40|$|NIMSingle, double, triple, and quadruple {{ionization}} {{cross sections}} of small cationic carbon clusters Cn+ colliding with helium atoms {{at a fixed}} velocity (2. 6 atomic units) have been measured. The size ranges from n= 1 to n= 10 for single to triple ionization, from n= 5 to n= 10 for the quadruple ionization. The dependence of the cross sections with the cluster size {{is found to be}} well reproduced by predictions of the independent atom and electron (IAE) collision model. This extends the applicability of this simple model to higher n values and to a higher ionization degree than previously done [M. Chabot et al., Eur. Phys. J. D 14, 5 (2001) ]. The branching ratios of multiply <b>charged</b> Cnq+ clusters <b>remaining</b> <b>intact</b> over a 100 ns time window have been measured (n= 3 - 10, q= 2 - 3). Branching ratios of nonfragmented doubly charged clusters have been interpreted on the basis of calculated internal energies of Cn 2 + due to single ionization of Cn+ clusters using the IAE model. This allowed estimates of the minimum energies required to fragment these Cn 2 + species to be derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the issue of}} the two {{definitions}} of charge, mainly the gauge charge and the effective charge of fundamental particles.

40|$|Electro-optical {{switching}} can {{be achieved}} by changing the optical absorption of metal nanoparticles by adding or removing <b>electrical</b> <b>charge,</b> corresponding to increased, respectively, decreased electron density. In this work a different approach is taken by changing the photoluminescence properties as a function of <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> on gold nanoparticles. Whereas larger gold nanoparticles (diameter d = 5 and 10 nm), exhibiting a plasmon resonance peak in the absorption spectrum, were used to measure changes of the optical absorption spectrum upon <b>electrical</b> <b>charging,</b> for smaller gold nanoparticles (d = 2 and 5 nm) <b>electrical</b> <b>charging</b> was observed via changes of the photoluminescence. Increase and decrease in photoluminescence was observed at positive and negative applied potentials, respectively. The relation between changes of optical absorption and photoluminescence for the 5 nm particles by <b>electrical</b> <b>charging</b> provides information on the influence of the charge state on the electronic properties and therefore the optical transition probability. The reported observation that not only the optical absorption, but also the photoluminescence is affected by alteration of the <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> onto gold nanoparticles may open a new way towards electro-optical switching and bio-sensing. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{establishing}} {{correlation between}} the nature of <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> of morocan stevensite Jbel Rhassoul clay particles and ionic dyes adsorption phenomenon. The <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of the clay mineral particles were assessed by measuring zeta potential (z) using micro electrophoresis technique. Measurements were carried out onto aqueous clay dispersions by varying the pH in the range 2. 5 – 12 with additions of HCl or NaOH. On the whole, the <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of stevensite particles remain negative in the whole pH range. Nevertheless, depending on the pH values, two behaviours were observed. For pH ranging from 2 to around 8, the negative <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> remains constant (z = - 20 mV) and corresponds to permanent charges of basal surfaces formed of –O-Si-O- groups insensitive to pH variation. Beyond pH = 8, the <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> increases (z = - 35 mV) {{as a result of}} deprotonation of silanol edge groups. Ionic dyes adsorption experiments show that anionic orange G adsorption is negligible whereas that of cationic methylene blue is greater due to columbic interactions. In accordance with eletrokinetic measurements, the methylene blue adsorption capacity onto stevensite particles significantly increases beyond pH » 8 due to the increase of the whole <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> of stevensite particles evolved by silanol edge sites deprotonation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Low density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) particles {{have shown}} to be heterogeneous structures with distinctive <b>electrical</b> <b>charges.</b> Alteration in the fatty acids content of the LDL particles is known to affect their structural features, <b>electrical</b> <b>charges,</b> and ultimately physiologic properties and, in this way, {{may play a role}} in the pathology of coronary artery disease (CAD). On the basis of evidences, in the present study, the relationship of fatty acids content of LDL particles and their <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> was assessed in patients with CAD in comparison with control subjects. Methods: In the current case- control study, from subjects who referred to the Mostafa Khomeini Hospital in Ilam during a time period from December 2013 to October 2014, 40 CAD patients and 40 control subjects were selected based on the clinical and angiographic parameters. The fatty acids content and <b>electrical</b> <b>charges</b> of LDL particles were measured by using a gas chromatography system, equipped with a flame ionization detector GC-FID, Acme 6000 M (Young Lin Co., Korea) as well as a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), respectively. Results: In the present study, CAD patients and control subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of LDL particles in the patients group was significantly lower than those in the control subjects (P= 0. 0001). There was an inverse correlation between the <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of the LDL particles and the saturated fatty acids as well as linoleic acid contents of them in CAD patients group. However, we found a direct correlation between the unsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids and some of the polyunsaturated ones) content of the LDL particles and their <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts (P= 0. 02). Conclusion: Results of the present study demonstrated that the increased saturated fatty acids as well as the linoleic acid contents of the LDL particles are associated with decreased <b>electrical</b> <b>charge</b> amounts of these particles and this situation may engage in pathogenesis of CAD...|$|R
