40|$|The four {{liquefaction}} processes {{proposed as}} {{a good candidate for}} LNG FPSO are simulated and evaluated. These processes include a single mixed refrigerant (SMR), dual mixed refrigerant (DMR), Niche LNG (CH 4 and N 2 process) and dual nitrogen expander. The steady state hysys simulation of the processes were undertaken to ensure that each simulated liquefaction process was compared on the identical parameters. An in-depth optimization has not been conducted but the simulation was aimed at obtaining an optimal efficient processes based on the simulated constraints. This thesis presents the analysis of the effects of natural gas pressure, temperature and composition on the proposed liquefaction processes for LNG FPSO. During the simulations the effects were analyzed by examining specific power, power consumption and refrigerant flow rate of the proposed processes. To meet the demand of greater efficiency and large capacity for liquefaction processes, thermodynamic analysis on the liquefaction processes for LNG FPSO also has been evaluated. The analysis of specific powers, power consumptions and refrigerant flow rates on the proposed processes shows that DMR specific power is lower than that of dual nitrogen expander by 50 %, Niche LNG by 41. 6 % and SMR by 9. 6 %. The power consumption of DMR is lower that of dual nitrogen expander by 54 %, Niche LNG by 47. 8 % and SMR by 9. 6 %. Also DMR has lowest refrigerant flow rate than that of dual nitrogen expander by 157. 6 %, Niche LNG DMR by 96. 4 % and SMR by 30. 9 %The production capacity of simulated processes shows that DMR has higher production capacity per train of (0. 91 MTPA/Train) and dual nitrogen expander has the lowest which is (0. 61 MTPA/Train) based on maximum duty of one LM 6000 gas turbine. DMR production capacity exceeded that of dual nitrogen expander by 33 %, Niche LNG by 29. 7 % and SMR by 8. 8 %. The analysis of effect of natural gas supply temperature on the proposed processes shows that the change of natural gas supply temperature has major effect of SMR process compared to other process. The analysis shows that when natural gas supply temperature decreases from 15 to 50 C SMR specific power and power consumption decrease by 14. 99 % and 15. 10 % respectively and when it is increases from 15 to 250 C its specific power and power consumption increases by 39. 27 % and 39. 19 respectively. The analysis of the effect of natural <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> on the proposed processes shows that when natural <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> decrease dual nitrogen expander has the highest effect with specific power and power consumption increases by 22. 41 % and 23. 25 % respectively and when natural <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> increases DMR has highest effect on specific power and power consumption which are 13. 06 % and 13. 67 % respectively. The effect of natural gas composition on the proposed natural gas liquefaction processes for LNG FPSO shows that for all proposed processes the change in natural gas composition may lead to increase or decrease of processes specific power, power consumptions or refrigerant flow rates. Energy efficiency is important to LNG production as feed gas is consumed in order to carry out the liquefaction process. The exergy analysis of the proposed process shows that shows that DMR process has highest useful exergy about 31 % compared to the other processes. Niche LNG and dual nitrogen expander has almost same useful exergy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Fluid-induced {{instability}} of a rotor-bearing system occurs frequently in rotating machinery. This involves {{two types of}} instability, i. e., fluid whirl and whip. Whirl is a predominately rigid-body mode and tracks at around one-half shaft running speed. Its threshold speed can be arbitrarily raised by using externally-pressurized fluid bearings, which allow for adjustable pressure for high stiffness. Whip is mainly a rotor-bending mode and locks into the rotor natural frequency. It appears when increases in bearing stiffness no longer influence the instability threshold. As demonstrated both analytically and experimentally in this paper, however, use of an externally-pressurized gas seal in the mid-span of the rotor can successfully eliminate whip. Its threshold speed can be greatly raised beyond running speed by adding the mid-span seal, to nearby the antinode of the rotor-bending mode. An experimental rig was operated at speed up to 10, 000 rpm, far above the rotor natural frequency of less than 2000 rpm without the seal. <b>Gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> could be adjusted to yield stiffness required for eliminating whip, which would otherwise appear even with an externally pressurized fluid bearing at the shaft end.

The gas turbine-generator set is an attractive option based on its low front-end capital cost, reliable performance at unmanned stations, and environmental performance characteristics. This report assesses gas turbine utilization issues from a perspective of fuel <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> requirements and discusses both cost and operational factors. A primary operational consideration for siting gas turbines on the electric distribution system is whether the local gas distribution company can <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> at the required pressure. Currently available gas turbine engines require <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressures</b> of at least 150 {{pounds per square inch}} gauge, more typically, 250 to 350 psig. Few LDCs maintain line pressure in excess of 125 psig. One option for meeting the gas pressure requirements is to upgrade or extend an existing pipeline and connect that pipeline to a high-pressure supply source, such as an interstate transmission line. However, constructing new pipeline is expensive, and the small volume of gas required by the turbine for the application offers little incentive for the LDC to provide this service. Another way to meet gas pressure requirements is to boost the compression of the fuel gas at the gas turbine site. Fuel gas booster compressors are readily available as stand-alone units and can satisfactorily increase the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> to meet the turbine engine requirement. However, the life-cycle costs of this equipment are not inconsequential, and maintenance and reliability issues for boosters in this application are questionable and require further study. These factors may make the gas turbine option a less attractive solution in DU applications than first indicated by just the $/kW capital cost. On the other hand, for some applications other DU technologies, such as photovoltaics, may be the more attractive option...|$|R

Being oil-free, self-acting gas film bearings are often the choice in high speed rotating machinery. Although plain aerostatic journal bearings carry more load and have superior lift characteristics, they suffer from instability problems, and one can add grooves to 'increase that stability. The research describe a mathematical model developed for small eccentricities, to predict the steady state and stability of enhanced capacity air bearings which combine external pressurisation and aerodynamic effects by adding grooves. This theory was than tested in a practical bearing design application. With {{the aid of a}} computer program geometry and thus load capacity, stiffness and stability were optimised. A prototype bearing based on a standard aerostatic bearing spindle, was designed, produced and tested. Stiffness, load capacity, pressure distribution and stability were monitored experimentally. The effects of the attitude angle on stability are discussed and it is concluded that the attitude angle is an unreliable predictor of bearing stability. Experimental dynamic stability studies have been carried out and the initial bearing spindle was operated with known amounts of unbalance at speeds up to 105000 rpm, with a <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> of 6 bar.

The natural frequencies were observed, and the critical speeds determined. The bearing successfully reached the maximum 120000 rpm speed predicted by the theoretical model for the bearing design, and at all speed the spindle remained stable.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer <b>gas</b> is <b>supplied</b> to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressures.</b> Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Dental {{air turbine}} handpieces {{have been widely}} used in {{clinical}} dentistry for over 30 years, yet little work has been reported on their performance. A few studies have been concerned with measurement of speed (i. e. rotation rate), torque and power performance of these devices, but neither investigations of functional relationships between controlling variables nor theory dealing specifically with this class of turbine have been reported. This has hindered the development of satisfactory methods of handpiece specification and of testing dental rotary cutting tools. It was the intention of the present work to remedy that deficiency. Methods: Measurements of pressure, temperature, gas flow rate and rotation rate were made with improved accuracy and precision for 14 ball bearing turbine handpieces on several gases. Functional relationships between <b>gas</b> properties, <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> flow rate, turbine design factors and free running speed were identified and equations describing these aspects of behaviour of this class of turbine developed. Results: The rotor radius, through peripheral Mach number, was found to be a major determinant of speed performance. In addition, gas flow was found to be an important limiting factor through the effect of choke. Conclusions: Each dental handpiece can be treated as a simple orifice of a characteristic cross-sectional area. Free running speed can be explained in terms of gas properties and pressure, with allowance for a design-specific performance coefficient. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Recently, a new <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> {{system with}} <b>pressure</b> {{measurements}} {{was installed in}} the Supersonic Molecular Beam Injection (SMBI) system on the HL- 2 A tokamak. The quantity of injected particles varies with parameters of SMBI has been measured. Using plasma density profile measured by the multi-channel high power DCN laser interferometer, the mean particle increment in the plasma could be calculated after an SMBI pulse. Fuelling efficiency is estimated as the particle increment of the plasma divided by the quantity of injected particles. Fuelling efficiency depends on Injection depth which {{is not only a}} key issue for fuelling techniques but also an important physical significance. The study on the penetration depth of SMBI has been carried out on the HL- 2 A tokamak through tangential D � arrays. The D � signals show that the SMB consists of a fast component (FC) and a slow component (SC) after passing through a conic nozzle, which is installed on SMB valve to improve the beam performance. The FC can penetrate more deeply such as 8. 5 cm inside the separatrix, while the SC is around 4 cm inside the separatrix. Some valuable phenomena with SMBI fuelling in H-mode discharges on HL- 2 A are also presented...|$|R
