40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore how participants made meaning in an environmental <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>course</b> for people from industry, business and local government in South Africa, and to identify and comment on any constraints to this meaning-making. I used a Symbolic Interactionist theoretical framework to explore and comment on the meaning-making process. I started my research by conducting a questionnaire to select participants for interviews. During the course the selected participants were interviewed, as well as the two course co-ordinators. Data was also gathered during the course from participant observation field notes ('captured talk'), photographs, participants' assignments and course evaluations. The data was analysed using an adapted form of discourse analysis and matrices. The research highlights that the opportunities provided on the course were adequate for encouraging meaning-making amongst both the co-ordinators and participants. However, recorded instances of meaning-making were low, which indicated that there were certain constraints during the meaning-making process. This research highlights and comments on identified constraints such as time and workplace support. The research supports similar findings which emerged from research conducted on the Gold Fields environmental education course for teachers and also offers recommendations for further research and practice into meaning-;making within the field of environmental education and industry, business and local government in South Africa. ...|$|E

40|$|The History of Education and Training of Adults in Alentejo / Portugal, is not recent. We {{can go back}} to the 70 's, {{even before}} the Revolution of April 25, 1974. At the time, {{approximately}} 30 % of the Portuguese population could neither read nor write. After 1974 the new political regime created a government office (Directorate General of Permanent Education / DGEP) with the responsibility of defining and implementing actions of adult education. Some universities, at the time, understood the importance of this area and followed this movement: {{as was the case with}} the University of Évora and the University of Minho.

40|$|Surgical {{education}} for medical students in Australia and New Zealand {{is provided by}} 19 universities in Australia and 2 in New Zealand. One surgical college is responsible for managing the education, training, assessment, and professional development programs for surgeons throughout both countries. The specialist surgical associations and societies act as agents of the college {{in the delivery of}} these programs, the extent of which varies among specialties. Historically, surgical training was divided into basic and specialist components with selection required for each part. In response to a number of factors, a new surgical education and training program has been developed. The new program incorporates a single merit-based national selection directly into the candidate’s specialty of choice. The existing curriculum for each of the nine specialties has been remodeled to a competence-based format in line with the competence required to undertake the essential roles of a surgeon. New standards and criteria have been produced for accreditation of health care facilities used for training. A new basic surgical skills <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>course</b> has been developed, with simulation playing an increasing role in all courses. Trainees’ progress is assessed by workplace-based assessment and formal examinations, including an exit examination. The sustained production of sufficient competent surgeons to meet societal needs encompasses many challenges including the recruitment of appropriate graduates and the availability of adequate educational and clinical resources to train them. Competence-based training is an attractive educational philosophy, but its implementation has brought its own set of issues, many of which have yet to be resolved...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} and develop a framework for understanding the mediating role of dogs in people's learning processes in vocational education and training settings. Specifically, it aims to answer two questions: In what ways do people use dogs as mediating artifacts in their meaning-making processes; {{and what are the}} effects of dogs in mediating individual and group learning processes? This study examines the lived experiences and reflections of 15 students and their teachers who interacted with three dogs during a six and a half day vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> The course was held in a major regional centre in northern Australia by a private training provider. The research employed six data collection techniques: a pre-course questionnaire; classroom observations; a critical events technique; the repertory grid technique; post-course interviews; and the researcher's personal journal. The {{results of this study suggest}} that there were four dichotomous dimensions of people's use of the dogs: Active—reFlective (A—F), Initiating—Responding (I—R), Material—Conceptual (M—C) and Spontaneous—Planned (S—P). These dimensions appear to resonate with three of the Big Five dimensions of personality. The Big Five dimensions of personality have been used to understand the different ways in which people learn. This suggests that people's use of the dogs as artifacts may share possible relationships with dimensions of personality and people's learning styles. Exploring these relationships suggested a previously hidden dimension of artifact use, Emotional—Logical (E—L), that may be congruent with another dimension of personality. Additionally, these dimensions appear to share dynamic relationships that may provide a deeper understanding of how people used the dogs as artifacts, by illustrating how they work and interact together. The results of this study also revealed Paws For Thought the functioning of individual preferences within these dimensions, which may have been moderated by a number of factors. The results of this study suggest that the mediating role of the dogs may be understood by the way they appeared to have functioned as artifacts in three domains of the learning environment: cognitive, affective and social. In the cognitive domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by stimulating arousal, attention, focus and concentration through positive distraction. In the affective domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by: triggering positive emotional responses to arousal; stimulating feelings of enjoyment, calm, warmth and peace; and by fostering a relaxed and informal atmosphere. In the social domain the dogs may be seen to have functioned as artifacts by: serving as a social ice-breaker, providing a value-free conversation starter; and by functioning in people's perceptions of others through the use of social axioms, which may have factored in the construction of their social relationships. This study is significant because it provides new knowledge by offering a framework for understanding the mediating role of dogs in people's learning processes. It therefore provides a map to understand in what ways dogs may be seen to function as artifacts and how this works. It also opens up ways of seeing and understanding what may occur in other settings, and provides new ways of being attentive to what happens in the classroom. The examination of the processes that take place during people's interaction with the dogs also provides new knowledge by offering a framework to understand how and why these interactions make the results reported by researchers possible. It may therefore open the way for improving animal assisted therapy and education programmes, and adapting them to situations beyond therapeutic and childhood education settings. This study holds significance for practitioners because it provides the opportunity to broaden traditional theories of artifacts and artifact use to include animals alongside the inanimate. It may also extend established understandings of artifacts and their use in the classroom. This understanding suggests the importance for practitioners to know how to use artifacts in different ways, and to show and teach those ways to others. This study holds further significance for practitioners because it reveals insights into how teachers may bridge the teacher—student divide by balancing their traditional focus on assessable outcomes and the task environment, with students' inherently social learning processes...|$|E
