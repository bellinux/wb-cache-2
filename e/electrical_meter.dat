50|$|Another {{positive}} to net-metering {{is the fact}} that it is fairly easy to configure. The user's <b>electrical</b> <b>meter</b> is simply able to record electrical power exiting as well as entering the home or business. As such, it records the net amount of power entering the home. For a grid with relatively few micro-CHP users, no design changes to the electrical grid need be made. Additionally, in the United States, federal and now many state regulations require utility operators to compensate anyone adding power to the grid. From the standpoint of grid operator, these points present operational and technical as well as administrative burdens. As a consequence, most grid operators compensate non-utility power-contributors at less than or equal to the rate they charge their customers. While this compensation scheme may seem almost fair at first glance, it only represents the consumer’s cost-savings of not purchasing utility power versus the true cost of generation and operation to the micro-CHP operator. Thus from the standpoint of micro-CHP operators, net-metering is not ideal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The term "Smart meter " {{typically}} {{refers to}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>meter,</b> but the term is also starting {{to be applied to}} the measurement of natural gas and water consumption. Similar meters, usually referred to as interval or time-of-use meters, have existed for years, but Smart Meters usually involve a different technology mix, such as real-time or near real-time reads, power outage notification, and power quality monitoring. These added features are more than simple automated meter reading (AMR). ADVANCED METERING ultimately, is to reduce costs, even though revenue shouldn’t increase, due to regulation. Any account that is not metered at a simple consumption rate including electric gas and water is utility point of view to understand Advanced Metering.

40|$|University of California at Merced is {{a unique}} campus that has benefited from {{intensive}} efforts to maximize energy efficiency, and has participated in a demand response program {{for the past two}} years. Campus demand response evaluations are often difficult because of the complexities introduced by central heating and cooling, non-coincident and diverse building loads, and existence of a single <b>electrical</b> <b>meter</b> for the entire campus. At the University of California at Merced, a two million gallon chilled water storage system is charged daily during off-peak price periods and used to flatten the load profile during peak demand periods, further complicating demand response scenarios. The goal of this research is to study demand response savings in the presence of storage systems in a campus setting. First, University of California at Merced is described and its participation in a demand response event during 2008 is detailed. Second, a set of demand response strategies were pre-programmed into the campus control system to enable semi-automated demand response during a 2009 event, which is also evaluated. Finally, demand savings results are applied to the utility?s DR incentives structure to calculate the financial savings under various DR programs and tariffs...|$|E
