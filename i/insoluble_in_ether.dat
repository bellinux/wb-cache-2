40|$|The liver {{tissues of}} man and certain animals (dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.) yield, upon {{alcoholic}} extraction, various substances which may be divided by their {{physical and chemical properties}} into several groups. While many substances are present in the alcoholic extract, the ones possessing antigenic properties are comparatively few. The latter are responsible for the antigenic properties exhibited by the whole alcoholic extract. The substances extracted with alcohol were fractionated into the following four groups. (a) Substances <b>Insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>Ether</b> and Hot Alcohol. —These are chiefly proteins and salts. The proteins are probably the minute particles of larger molecules held in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substances are removed. The water extracted from the tissues and admixed with alcohol is also an essential factor in extracting these particles in an alcoholic solution. The salts present are the usual physiological constituents of the liver, notably, sodium chloride. The quantity of these substances extracted with alcohol varies greatly with different specimens. Biologically considered, they are neither markedly hemolytic nor anticomplementary and possess no antigenic property for the Wassermann reaction. It is important, however, to note that the proteins bind complement when mixed with certain active human sera. For this reason a preparation of antigen containing this group of substances is unsuitable for use in combination with an active serum, and should, therefore, be rejected. (b) Substances <b>Insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>Ether</b> and Soluble in Hot Alcohol. —This group contains soaps, cleavage products of proteins, and small amounts of the bile salts. Soaps and bile salts are very strongly hemolytic and are absolutely unfit for use as antigen. Moreover, their antigenic properties are very slight. It is best to eliminate this group of substances from the preparation of antigen. The quantity of the substances of this group extracted from different specimens of tissue is very variable. (c) Substances Soluble in Ether, Alcohol, and Aceton. —In this group are found varying amounts of fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, some neutral fats, cholesterin and many unidentified lipoidal bodies. This group causes either hemolysis or inhibition, of hemolysis. In other words, it is anticomplementary as well as hemolytic in the majority of preparations. At the same time, in some preparations it is, to a certain extent, antigenic. This great variation in the amounts of these substances in given extracts renders their presence in the antigen preparation undesirable. It is not denied, however, that, when added in adequate quantities, some of these substances may improve the activity of the antigenic lipoids. (d) Substances Insoluble in Aceton. —This group of substances consists of phosphatids. The best known among them is, of course, lecithin. Besides lecithin, however, there must be various other phosphatids present in this fraction. It will be noticed that the precipitate formed by mixing the ethereal solution with aceton contains a certain amount of lipoids <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ether</b> as well as in alcohol. Before the fractionation in aceton, all lipoids were soluble in ether or ethyl alcohol. Further analytical work {{on the nature of the}} phosphatids contained in this fraction is necessary. This fraction, in general, is more constant in amount in the various liver extracts. Biologically considered, it is the most important. It is usually non-hemolytic, frequently anticomplementary, but much more strongly antigenic than the other fractions. The antigenic strength varies with different preparations, being almost absent in the extracts derived from fatty livers. An aceton insoluble fraction may be strongly antigenic without any other auxiliary effects, or may be accompanied by an anticomplementary property. This fraction does not cause the so-called non-specific reaction with an active human serum. For these reasons it is recommended (as Noguchi has repeatedly done before) that the antigen should be selected from the aceton-insoluble fractions. Iodine Value in Relation to Antigenic Value. —Speaking generally of the aceton-insoluble fraction, a high antigenic value is associated with a high iodine value of lipoids obtained from the liver and heart. This rule does not, however, apply to the corresponding fraction from the brain. Standard Antigen. —The preparation of a standard antigen for Noguchi's method for the diagnosis of syphilis is given just before the summary. The directions will enable one to make a stock solution, from which, at any time, a suitable antigenic emulsion may be obtained...|$|E

Pilocarpine is an {{alkaloid}} of Pilocarpus, and to {{this primary}} action the crude drug owes its principal effect. The plant from which pilocarpine is derived grows in Brazil, South America. DESCRIPTION. It is about ten (10) to fifteen (15) C. M. long and from four (4) to six (6) C. M. broad. Short stalk, of a dull green color, coriaceous, pellucid- punctuate, mostly smooth; when bruised, slightly aromatic. Taste somewhat bitter and pungent. CONSTITUENTS. From this plant several other alkaloidal products are derived such as Jaborine C 22 H 32 N 4 O 4; Pilocarpudine C 10 H 14 N 2 O 2;Jaborandine whose composition is not exactly known. Pilocarpine is the hydrochlorate of an alkaloid obtained from pilocarpus with alcohol and hydrochloric acid by distillation and evaporation. The residue is dissolved in a slight excess of ammonia and chloroform, shaken with water, and then neutralized with hydrochloric acid. On evaporation crystals of hydrochlorate are formed. The properties of filocarpine,small white crystals having no odor but slightly bitter taste, are very soluble in water and alcohol, but almost <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ether</b> or chloroform.

How Made: The compounds known as quinolines and isoquinolines {{have been the subject}} of extensive investigation since their extraction from coal tar in the nineteenth century. They are considered a heterocylic aromatic compound, with a double ring structure similar to a benzene ring; derived from napthalene with a trivalent nitrogen atom substituted for a carbon atom on one of the rings. Substitution of a hydroxyl group on position 8 of the aromatic nucleus of quinoline converts it to oxyquinoline(also called 8 -quinolinol) and confers phenolic properties (Lipnicki, 2001 b). Quinoline can be extracted from coal tar distillated by caustic extraction and then by distillation of the oil to produce a methylnapthalene fraction. This is then washed with dilute sulfuric acid to produce sulfate salts. The mixture of compounds attained can then be further separated using forms of chromatography. ∗ OMRI’s information is enclosed in square brackets in Italics.

40|$|ABSTRACT: N – histidyl – 2, 4 – pentanedione Schiff {{base was}} {{prepared}} from {{the reaction of}} histidine and 2, 4 -pentandione. The reaction of methanolic solution of N – histidyl – 2, 4 – pentanedione Schiff base with ethanolic solution of copper (II) chloride gave diaquo bis (N – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex. The prepared Schiff base is crystalline orange yellow, has a yield of 51 % and melting point of 292 oC. The prepared diaquo bis (N – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex is crystalline green, has a yield of 72 % and decomposition temperature of 345 oC. The Schiff base is soluble in most solvent including water, but <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ether.</b> The diaquo bis (N – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex is soluble in water, DMSO and DMF, but insoluble in most common organic solvents.

The infra-red spectral data showed bands in the range 1612 – 1634 and 1590 - 1610 cm- 1, assignable to v(C=N) stretching vibrations of Schiff base and its copper (II) complex, respectively. The broad bands in the range 3345 - 3470 and 3352 - 3431 cm- 1 are attributable to v(O-H) stretching frequencies in the Schiff base and it complex compound, respectively.

40|$|Though {{kala-azar}} {{has been}} observed in Japan {{to such an extent}} that it may not necessarily be considered a rare disease, the etiological basis of its more conspicuous characteristics, viz. anemia and Banti 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, has not been established. In the author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion the development of both the anemia and the Banti 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome may be closely associated with the splenomegaly which is so evident in kala-azar. Experimental studies were carried out by the author with the following results: 1. Clinical observations on ten kala-azar cases revealed that the leishmania disappeared form the sternal or splenic aspiration after one to two courses of pentavalent antimony in nine cases-one case having required treatment with stilbamidine. In addition the anemia was improving in parallel with the reduction in splenomegaly. 2. The serum of the kala-azar patient produces an anemia in rabbits. This anemia-producing action is demonstrable during the period of splenomegaly, but is not necessarily associated with the presence of leishmania organisms. This anemia-producing factor is thermostable and soluble in water, but, <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ether</b> and methyl, alcohol. 3. No such anemia-producing action is seen in the serum of the normal man or the cured kala azar patient. 4.

40|$|Scientific {{research}} concerning growth inhibitors, {{which has}} been pursued for several decades already, dealt mainly with {{the effect of these}} substances on the germination process. WIESNER (1894) demonstrated the presence of a growth inhibitor in the slime of the mistletoe (Viscum album) which prevented the germination of a great variety of seeds. OPPENHEIMER (1922) supplemented the analysis by placing seeds on the pulp of ripe tomatoes and he observed a strong inhibitive effect {{as a result of this}} treatment. In addition, however, he found that the inhibiting substance is thermolabile and <b>insoluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>ether</b> or alcohol. REINHARD (1933) corroborated Oppenheimer’s results for the most part. According to this author, however, the inhibiting agent in tomato juice is thermostabile, and it is not destroyed by boiling, neiher by neutralisation or by diluting the juice 50 times. In other fleshy fruits such as apples, pears and quinces KÖCKEMANN (1934) detected inhibiting substances capable of preventing the germination of Lepidium seeds. These substances were reported to be sensitive to peroxide and to alkali, thermostabile and soluble in water and in ether, but insoluble in petroleum ether. On the other hand, the inhibiting agent extracted by LEHMANN (1937) from the exocarp if buckwheat is thermolabile. In Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa, finally, RUGE (1939) demonstrated the presence of an inhibitor that reduces the speed of germination to a considerable extent. FRÖSCHEL’S investigations on Trifolium and Beta will be dealt with in 4. This survey is not quite exhaustive, but clearly demonstrates that the inhibiting agent should not be regarded as a definite, well-defined chemical substance which is always the same in every individual case, but as a group of substances with analogous activities but most probably with widely divergent physical and chemical properties.
