50|$|Hinduja is {{the largest}} {{automotive}} <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundry</b> in India with production capacity of nearly 100,000 MT of grey iron casting and 3000 MT of aluminum gravity die-casting.|$|E
50|$|ESCO {{survived the}} Great Depression {{primarily}} as a <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundry,</b> making castings for sawmills, pulp and paper mills. In 1932, ESCO opened its first stainless steel industrial service center. During the 1940s, ESCO added new products to meet demand for supply valves, pump bodies, anchor chains and other components for warships and tanks. In 1946, ESCO developed the two piece tooth tooth system and, in 1948, the company entered the cable excavator bucket market.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{to stress that}} {{foundries}} utilise mechanisation and automation depending {{on the need for}} reproductivity and on the series sizes. The most flexible installation is typically the <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundry.</b> This produces a variety of products in small numbers (say < 100). In general, this type of foundry applies manual moulding techniques with resin-bonded sand moulds. The melting furnace works batch wise to allow an easy change of alloy.|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensional}} {{variability of}} casting features from production gray and ductile iron castings has been characterized. Dimensional data from castings and patterns has been collected from castings produced at several <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundries.</b> The variability of over 300 casting features from castings produced in green sand molds using jolt squeeze, high-pressure horizontal parting line and vertical parting line molding processes have been evaluate...|$|R
50|$|In 1884 the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company was incorporated. The {{company was}} in the {{business}} of making screws and taps but also began to make machine tools. A basic component in machine tools at this time was gray iron castings. The company bought castings from <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundries</b> for the machine tools it manufactured. Some of the Cincinnati local foundries which supplied to the machine tool company included the Blackburn Foundry, Buckeye Foundry Company, The Steel Foundry Company (Cincinnati) and others.|$|R
50|$|The method {{alike to}} the DISA's (DISAMATIC) {{vertical}} molding is flaskless, however horizontal. The matchplate molding technology is today used widely. Its great advantage is inexpensive pattern tooling, easiness {{of changing the}} molding tooling, thus suitability for manufacturing castings in short series so typical for the <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundries.</b> Modern matchplate molding machine is capable of high molding quality, less casting shift due to machine-mold mismatch (in some cases less than 0.15 mm), consistently stable molds for less grinding and improved parting line definition. In addition, the machines are enclosed for a cleaner, quieter working environment with reduced operator exposure to safety risks or service-related problems.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 89 - 92. The {{scheduling}} {{of production}} in job shops is generally accomplished in four stages; aggregate planning, machine loading, sequencing and detailed scheduling. In industrial job shops, {{the number of}} jobs and machines makes detailed scheduling a particularly complicated and unwieldy task. When faced with this situation, a typical response of managements is to simply ignore the problem and apply some remedial action by adapting existing company operation procedures. The first objective of this dissertation is to indicate the dangers and inefficiencies which result when the problem of detailed scheduling is ignored. This is done in terms of a case study analysis in which the problems which currently exist in the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium, a <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundry,</b> are illustrated. The second objective is to develop a systematic approach for the solution of detailed scheduling in job shops. Major steps in this approach are: i) a classification of shop scheduling problems ii) a survey of relevant scheduling literature in order to determine existing detailed scheduling techniques iii) the design of the scheduling system This approach is illustrated by applying it to the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium...|$|E

50|$|In 1962, Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S (DISA-DISAMATIC) {{invented a}} flask-less molding process by using {{vertically}} parted and poured molds. The first line could produce up to 240 complete sand molds per hour. Today molding lines can achieve a molding rate of 550 sand molds {{per hour and}} requires only one monitoring operator. Maximum mismatch of two mold halves is 0.1 mm. Although very fast, vertically parted molds are not typically used by <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundries</b> due to the specialized tooling needed to run on these machines. Cores need to be set with a core mask as opposed to by hand and must hang in the mold {{as opposed to being}} set on parting surface.|$|R
40|$|In {{grey cast}} iron remelt and recycling, white iron can result in the cast product if careful control of the {{chilling}} tendency is not ensured. Many <b>jobbing</b> <b>foundries</b> are constrained in furnace types and available foundry additives that the operation always results in white irons. This study is towards ensuring grey iron is reproduced from cast iron scrap auto engine blocks, when using a diesel fired rotary furnace and a FeSi alloy for structural modification (inoculation). With varying addition rate of the FeSi alloy to the tapped molten metal, chill wedge tests were performed on two different wedge samples of type W (according to ASTM A 367 - wedge test) with cooling modulus of 0. 45 cm (W 3 Â½) and 0. 54 cm (W 4). The carbon equivalents for the test casts were within hypoeutectic range (3. 85 wt. (%) to 4. 11 wt. (%)). In the W 4 wedge sample, at 2. 0 wt. (%) addition rate of the FeSi alloy, the relative clear chill was totally reduced to zero from 19. 76 %, while the relative mottled chill was brought down to 9. 59 % from 33. 71 %. The microstructure from the cast at this level of addition was free of carbidic phases; it shows randomly oriented graphite flakes evenly distributed in the iron matrix. Hardness assessment shows that increasing rate of FeSi addition results in decreasing hardness, with maximum effect at 2. 0 wt. (%) addition. With equivalent aspect ratio (cooling modulus) in a target cast product, this addition rate for this FeSi alloy under this furnace condition will attain graphitized microstructure in the cast product...|$|R
