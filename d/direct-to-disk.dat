40|$|The TAXI <b>Direct-to-Disk</b> {{interface}} is a special-purpose {{interface circuit}} for demultiplexing {{of data from}} a Racal Storeplex (or equivalent) multichannel recorder onto one or more hard disks that reside in, and/or are controlled by, a personal computer (PC). (The name TAXI as used here {{is derived from the}} acronym TAXI, which signifies transparent asynchronous transceiver interface.) The TAXI <b>Direct-to-Disk</b> interface was developed for original use in capturing data from instrumentation on a test stand in a NASA rocket-testing facility. The control, data-recording, and data-postprocessing equipment of the facility are located in a control room at a safe distance from the test stand. Heretofore, the transfer of data from the instrumentation to the postprocessing equipment has entailed post-test downloading via software, requiring many hours to days of post-test reduction before the data could be viewed in a channelized format. The installation of the TAXI <b>Direct-to-Disk</b> interface, in conjunction with other modifications, causes the transfer of data to take place in real time, so that the data are immediately available for review during or after the test. The instrumentation is connected to the input terminals of the signal-processing unit of multichannel recorder by standard coaxial cables. The coaxial output of the signal processing unit is converted to fiber-optic output by means of a commercial coaxial-cable/fiber-optic converter (that is, a fiber-optic transceiver) designed specifically for this application. The fiber-optic link carries the data signals to an identical fiber-optic transceiver in the control room. On the way to the TAXI <b>Direct-to-Disk</b> interface that is the focus of this article, the data signals are processed through a companion special purpose circuit denoted by the similar name parallel TAXI interface...|$|E
40|$|With {{assistance}} from Stennis Space Center, Vexcel {{was able to}} strengthen the properties of its Apex Ground Station(TM), an affordable, end-to-end system that comes complete with a tracking antenna that permits coverage within an approximate 2, 000 -kilometer radius of its location, a high speed <b>direct-to-disk</b> data acquisition system that can download information from virtually any satellite, and data processing software for virtually all synthetic aperture radar and optical satellite sensors. Vexcel is using an Apex system linked to the Terra satellite to help scientists and NASA personnel measure land and ocean surface temperatures, detect fires, monitor ocean color and currents, produce global vegetation maps and data, and assess cloud characteristics and aerosol concentrations. In addition, Vexcel is providing NASA with close-range photogrammetry software for the International Space Station. The technology, commercially available as FotoG(TM), was developed with SBIR funding and support from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Commercially, FotoG is used for demanding projects taken on by engineering firms, nuclear power plants, oil refineries, and process facilities.

40|$|Disk Recording System (DRS) is a systems-integration {{computer}} {{program for a}} <b>direct-to-disk</b> (DTD) high-speed data acquisition system (HDAS) that records rocket-engine test data. The HDAS consists partly of equipment originally designed for recording the data on tapes. The tape recorders were replaced with hard-disk drives, necessitating the development of DRS to provide an operating environment that ties two computers, a set of five DTD recorders, and signal-processing circuits from the original tape-recording version of the HDAS into one working system. DRS includes three subsystems: (1) one that generates a graphical user interface (GUI), {{on one of the}} computers, that serves as a main control panel; (2) one that generates a GUI, on the other computer, that serves as a remote control panel; and (3) a data-processing subsystem that performs tasks on the DTD recorders according to instructions sent from the main control panel. The software affords capabilities for dynamic configuration to record single or multiple channels from a remote source, remote starting and stopping of the recorders, indexing to prevent overwriting of data, and production of filtered frequency data from an original time-series data file...|$|E
40|$|The {{range of}} mining {{applications}} from hard rock quarrying to coal exposure to mineral recovery {{leads to a}} great variety of blasting practices. A common characteristic of many of the sources is that they are detonated at or near the earth`s surface and thus can be recorded by camera or video. Although the primary interest is in the seismic waveforms that these blasts generate, the visual observations of the blasts provide important constraints that {{can be applied to the}} physical interpretation of the seismic source function. In particular, high speed images can provide information on detonation times of individuals charges, the timing and amount of mass movement during the blasting process and, in some instances, evidence of wave propagation away from the source. All of these characteristics can be valuable in interpreting the equivalent seismic source function for a set of mine explosions and quantifying the relative importance of the different processes. This paper documents work done at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Southern Methodist University to take standard Hi- 8 video of mine blasts, recover digital images from them, and combine them with ground motion records for interpretation. The steps in the data acquisition, processing, display, and interpretation are outlined. The authors conclude that the combination of video with seismic and acoustic signals can be a powerful diagnostic tool for the study of blasting techniques and seismology. A low cost system for generating similar diagnostics using consumer-grade video camera and <b>direct-to-disk</b> video hardware is proposed. Application is to verification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty...|$|E
