30|$|For China, {{stepping}} into the circle of the world’s developed countries requires about 65  % proportion of service employment absorption, 10  % of agricultural employees, and keeping about 25  % for industrial employees. That is to say, maintaining the employment proportion of three industry structures as 1 : 2.5 : 6.5 is well in line with China’s actual conditions and the evolution law of the world’s industry. Standing on this proportion, if the sum of employees is kept unchanged, it still needs to transfer about 190 million rural labors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>industry</b> and 30 million manufacturing employees from the secondary industry, namely, the net increase of service employees being 220 million.|$|E

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of Landcare in Australia is missing a vital component. Although {{the environmental and}} agricultural outcomes have been well-explored, the many other benefits of Landcare and natural resource management (NRM) beyond these domains have, for the most part, been only anecdotally acknowledged. Recognising this, the Australian Landcare Council commissioned {{an investigation of the}} benefits of Landcare and NRM that exist beyond the biophysical domain. The research was intended to establish the extent of the evidence base and to build this into a stronger case for investment in Landcare and NRM, both to ensure ongoing levels of funding and to gain support <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>industries</b> and environment sectors. The findings of this research reveal an impressive array of multiple benefits. The literature review, interviews and case studies that underpin the findings identified six main categories of benefits, incorporating 21 sub-categories of benefits.

40|$|Types of land {{disposed}} residuals from selected {{metal smelting}} and refining industries are described, {{as are the}} origin and disposition of land disposed residuals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> copper <b>industry</b> as an example. Quantities of land-disposed or stored residuals, including slags, sludges, and dusts, are given per unit of metal production for most primary and secondary metal smelting and refining industries. Assessments of the hazard potential of residuals are given. Present treatment and disposal of residuals are discussed and assessed for health and environmental protection. Possible technologies for protection of ground and surface water contamination are presented. These include lined lagoons, chemical fixation of sludge, and ground sealing. Possibilities of resource recovery from residuals are discussed. Data are presented showing attenuation of heavy metal ions and fluorides in selected soils. The leachability and mobility of smelting and refining residuals constituents, including heavy metals and fluorides, and other potential toxicants in specific soil, geologic, and hydrologic disposal environments must be carefully considered in setting disposal requirements...|$|R

The early 20th century saw a shift in economic emphasis away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional agricultural <b>primary</b> <b>industries</b> towards industrialisation. Henry Jones' waterfront factory had outgrown its requirements by 1911 as demand continued to grow, and Henry Jones IXL built a grand new factory {{on the eastern side}} of Constitution Dock, which was the first reinforced concrete building in Australia. In what was a pre-war period of development, several new buildings were added to the Hobart skyline in the early 20th century. In 1911, the grand new Hobart City Hall was opened, which had been designed by competition winner R. N. Butler.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} evidence of carbon leakage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> European <b>primary</b> aluminium <b>industry</b> during <b>the</b> first 6 ½ years of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The findings suggest that while rising electricity prices in several major producer countries in the EU have {{played a critical role}} in the rise in net imports of EU <b>primary</b> aluminium into <b>the</b> EU in recent years, the role of CO 2 costs in this equation has been more limited than was expected in the ex-ante literature. Other factors, including rising primary energy prices and difficulties for primary smelters in obtaining long-term electricity-supply contracts, appear to have been more economically important factors than the relatively low CO 2 costs which have been witnessed so far...|$|R
2500|$|Drying timber is {{one method}} of adding value to sawn {{products}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> wood processing <b>industries.</b> According to the Australian Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation (FWPRDC), green sawn hardwood, which is sold at about $350 per cubic metre or less, increases in value to $2,000 per cubic metre or more with drying and processing. However, currently used conventional drying processes often result in significant quality problems from cracks, both externally and internally, reducing {{the value of}} the product. For example, in Queensland (Anon, 1997), on the assumption that 10% of the dried softwood is devalued by $200 per cubic metre because of drying defects, saw millers are losing about $5 million a year. In Australia, the loss could be $40 million a year for softwood and an equal or higher amount for hardwood. Thus, proper drying under controlled conditions prior to use is of great importance in timber use, in countries where climatic conditions vary considerably at different times of the year.|$|R
40|$|Ponded pasture {{establishment}} {{has occurred}} for over 20 years in Central Queensland. The use of ponding banks to store water has enabled increased pasture productivity {{and length of}} growing season. In recent years commercial fishermen {{and members of the}} Wildlife Preservation Society have raised environmental concerns over the construction of ponding banks and development of ponded pasture. This came to a head after a field trip to visit ponded pastures north of Rockhampton in late 1990. As a result of this trip which involved staff <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Department of <b>Primary</b> <b>Industries,</b> <b>the</b> Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Wildlife Preservation Society, commercial fishermen and the University of Central Queensland it was suggested by Mr Richard Grimes, Q.

40|$|Plant weeds, {{pests and}} {{diseases}} comprise significant threats to pastoral agriculture in New Zealand. The extent of damage incurred by New Zealand’s agricultural industry from these weed and pest threats varies significantly {{depending on the}} response implemented, and the technologies available. This paper assesses the projected economic impact of three individual potential failures in plant protection, specifically the spread of clover root weevil, giant buttercup and glassy-winged sharpshooter across New Zealand, and the potential mitigation of economic loss caused by these failures through various response methods. This assessment is carried out {{with the use of}} a national-level agricultural production and value model, based on data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ministry for <b>Primary</b> <b>Industries</b> farm models and the Lincoln Trade and Environment Model, an international trade and environment model. The model projects economic impact on agriculture until 2030, comparing the differences in economic impact between business as usual without the advent of each threat and then with the advent of each threat alongside various potential responses. The modelled responses cover firstly the most probable responses, and secondly the use of biological control agents, in the form of a parasitoid or bio-herbicide control. The results show that biological controls offer the most effective and feasible responses to the modelled threats to pastoral agriculture compared with other responses...|$|R
