5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.|$|E

Deep stops performed during a dive where the decompression is calculated in real-time are simply part of a multi-level dive to the computer, and add no risk beyond that which <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> algorithm.|$|E

500|$|The Islamic {{concept of}} Taqwa {{is closely related}} to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to [...] "right conduct" [...] or [...] "piety", [...] "guarding of oneself" [...] or [...] "guarding against evil". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the {{ultimate}} source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E

2500|$|... his type of possessory land claim-seeking {{possession}} of a large swath of central New York State and the ejectment {{of tens of thousands}} of landowners [...] [...] [...] is indisputably disruptive. Indeed, this disruptiveness <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> claim itself-which asks this Court to overturn years of settled land ownership-rather than an element of any particular remedy which would flow from the possessory land claim. Accordingly, we conclude that possessory land claims of this type are subject to the equitable considerations discussed in Sherrill.|$|E
2500|$|Such a {{disagreement}} cannot be easily resolved, because it <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> radically different terms and goals (that is, the theories) of the critics. Their theories of reading derive from vastly different intellectual traditions: the New Critic bases {{his work on}} an East-Coast American scholarly and religious tradition, while the Marxist derives his thought from a body of critical social and economic thought, the post-structuralist's work emerges from twentieth-century Continental philosophy of language, and the Darwinian from the modern evolutionary synthesis. To expect such different approaches to {{have much in common}} would be naïve; so calling them all [...] "theories of literature" [...] without acknowledging their heterogeneity is itself a reduction of their differences.|$|E

Sex trafficking in the United States may be present in Asian massage parlors, Mexican cantina bars, residential brothels, or street-based pimp-controlled prostitution. The anti-trafficking community in the United States is debating the extent of sexual slavery. Some groups argue that exploitation <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of commercial sex, while other groups take a stricter approach to defining sexual slavery, considering an element of force, fraud or coercion to be necessary for sex slavery to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Cox aims {{to prevent}} {{discrimination}} against Muslim women and 'jurisdiction creep' in Islamic tribunals, {{which would be}} forced to acknowledge the primacy of English law under a bill introduced to the House of Lords in May 2012. [...] The bill will introduce an offence carrying a five-year jail sentence for anyone falsely claiming or implying that sharia courts or councils have legal jurisdiction over family or criminal law. The bill, which will apply to all arbitration tribunals if passed, aims to tackle discrimination, which its supporters say <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts, by banning the sharia practice of giving woman's testimony only half the weight of men's. [...] In a similar way to Jewish Beth Din courts, sharia tribunals can make verdicts in cases involving financial and property issues which, under the Arbitration Act 1996, are enforceable by county courts or the high court.|$|E
2500|$|In broad terms, {{transport}} {{agencies and}} interface agencies {{caught by the}} Act must have regard to the objectives and principles when exercising their powers and performing their functions.

[...] This <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> listing {{of a series of}} objectives and principles which involve deliberate overlap and tension and which can require careful thought to reconcile. [...] As a result, the Act merely requires that agencies [...] "have regard" [...] to the matters - that is actively consider them - and does not attempt to prescribe particular outcomes in individual cases. [...] In addition, the framework specifically provides that the weight to be given to each objective and principle in the Act is not prescribed by the scheme itself and instead is ultimately a matter to be determined by the relevant agency which is responsible for the decision.|$|E
