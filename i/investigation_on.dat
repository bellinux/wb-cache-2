Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB <b>{{investigation}}</b> <b>on</b> {{the grounds that}} it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug <b>investigation.</b> <b>On</b> March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Investigation</b> <b>on</b> this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the {{day before}} the Dunkirk evacuation, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{presented}} a diplomatic note that accused the Lithuanian government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty. The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape, and that the third, Butayev, was murdered. Earlier in May, Butayev had deserted his unit and was searched by the Lithuanian police. When found, he committed suicide. The Lithuanian government replied that the accusations were baseless, but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission. However, the commission's requests for detailed information, including interviews, photographs, physical descriptions, or other data that could further the investigation, went unanswered. The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the <b>investigation</b> <b>on</b> its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an <b>investigation</b> <b>on</b> how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E
