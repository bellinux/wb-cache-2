5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as she knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of the show. The actor {{said he could not}} turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character had an interesting story arc.

25|$|Chao's mother, Felisa Ortega, is from Bilbao, Basque Country, and his father, {{writer and}} {{journalist}} Ramón Chao, is from Vilalba, Galicia. They emigrated to Paris to avoid Francisco Franco's dictatorship—Manu's grandfather had {{been sentenced to}} death. Shortly after Manu's birth, the Chao family moved {{to the outskirts of}} Paris, and Manu spent most of his childhood in Boulogne-Billancourt and Sèvres. As he grew up he was surrounded by many artists and intellectuals, most of whom were acquaintances of his father. Chao cites much of his childhood experience as inspiration for some songs. As a child, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of Cuban singer-pianist Bola de Nieve.|$|E
25|$|Just like Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus {{during the}} ABBA era, Ted usually wrote pidgin English demo lyrics when he {{composed}} his songs {{and it was}} subsequently Kenneth's task to translate them into Swedish while staying true to Ted's original idea for a particular song. Kenneth spent {{a considerable amount of}} time getting the words exactly as Ted wanted them, with the right number of syllables to the bar, rhymes and alliterations emphasising the rhythm of the music, and then also with the specific language of a boy in his teens, occasionally including slang expressions. Just like sound engineer Tretow, Ted was also known for his prankish sense of humour, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus and loved practical jokes, which also is reflected in the lyrics in the form of clever puns, word play, and double entendres. Kenneth's skills as a lyricist paradoxically resulted in {{the fact that some of}} Ted's audiences, in the 1970s and even to the present day, were under the impression that he wrote both the music and all lyrics, which Kenneth has since revealed that he only took as recognition that he had done Ted's music justice and it was the best compliment that he could get.|$|E

500|$|Join Hands {{was later}} namechecked by other {{critically}} acclaimed musicians. James Murphy, {{the leader of}} LCD Soundsystem, expressed {{an appreciation of the}} album stating the first records he bought were Join Hands, the Fall's Grotesque and the Birthday Party's [...] "Nick the Stripper". [...] "All three of those records are three of my favourite things I've ever heard", he said.

500|$|The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) {{approached}} Danny Boyle to be {{the director}} of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted. Boyle explained that there had been four things that made him take the job: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do. He said it [...] "felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility" [...] to take the job.|$|E
500|$|The boy was curious, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking {{the name of}} the film.

('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How can you not know his name? ...|$|E

500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> pop star. Pop star status meant press, {{a good chance}} to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{resolution}} of Karen and David's storyline in the pilot, in which David concedes that the couple need to hire a nanny, Jacey Salles was cast as Ramona Ramirez. Salles was a bit-part actress in BBC sitcoms and had previously appeared in the 1998 Granada film The Misadventures of Margaret, which was co-produced by Harries. In her Cold Feet audition she was required to have a loud argument with her boyfriend over the telephone. She embellished this with [...] "a bit of comic bastardisation of the English language" [...] and won the part. Initially contracted for only two episodes, Salles assumed the Marsdens would employ a new nanny every few episodes, though she made two more appearances in the first series and eventually appeared in every series. Lennie James made two guest appearances as Kris Bumstead, though his second appearance in Episode 6 was mostly {{in the form of}} flashbacks. James was keen to find out {{the resolution}} to the [...] "who's the father?" [...] cliffhanger, reportedly repeatedly asking the producers whether the baby was Kris's. Other actors to make appearances were Denis Lawson as Alexander Welch and Sam Kelly as Algernon Gifford. John Thomson was pleased to work with Kelly, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of 'Allo 'Allo!, a sitcom in which Kelly appeared.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed {{in and around the}} Los Angeles, California area. Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick remembers being [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he could think about was stumbling upon a snake.|$|E
