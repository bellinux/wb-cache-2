2500|$|In an August 2017 {{review of}} the {{aircraft}} done by AVweb's Paul Bertorelli, he said: [...] "is it a great airplane or just a good airplane? If the measure of greatness isn’t defined by absolute speed, pure efficiency or herculean payload, but of how well the design resonates with the intended buyer, the Vision Jet is both a great airplane and a significant one. It’s great because I think SR22 owners will swoon over this thing and significant because it represents a class of its own, expanding practical (if not cheap) jet ownership downward. At a typical invoice of $2.1 million, the Vision Jet is the least expensive <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> there and on a speed vs. dollars matrix, it more than holds its own against whatever competition {{it has in the}} low-and-slow tier, and that’s basically nothing in the turbojet category." [...] At FL270 and ISA +15°C it cruises at [...] and consumes [...]|$|E

The ink was a lustrous black on the dull blackness of the burnt paper. I could still read this much of my indiscretion remaining, [...] "He smiled at them all and said nothing." ...|$|E

[...] Original Misfits guitarist Franché Coma remarked that [...] "Fiend Club Lounge {{is one of the best}} renditions of some of the best Misfits songs ever recorded. Any true, and I mean true musician will appreciate the intricacies of the instrumentations on this CD. It takes punk music to a different level. It shows us how anything is possible if you want to make it happen. You'll think you are listening to a soundtrack from a big screen movie. A great lush theatrical feel." ...|$|E

50|$|During this time, Walker {{would later}} be invited to make his first {{full-time}} attempt at full-fender stock car racing. Tyler had signed with Tyler Jet Motorsports, owned by Tyler, Texas native Tim Beverly, {{to compete in the}} NASCAR Busch Series in the year of 2000. To prepare for this, he made a start in the grueling ARCA Bondo/MarHyde Series driving for Beverly. His #15 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix qualified and finished twenty-eighth, three laps off of the pace at the EasyCare Vehicle Service Contracts 150 at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Unfortunately for Walker, the necessary sponsorship needed to finance a competitive entry did not materialize for the 2000 season, so Tyler's deal with Tyler <b>Jet</b> <b>out</b> of Tyler, Texas became null and void. He made one attempt at the BellSouth Mobility 320, driving the #28 Larry Lockamy entry, but his qualifying speed was too slow to make the competitive 43-car field.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to her natural scientific genius and her status as a polymath, Superia possesses several superhuman powers that she apparently gave to herself via genetic alterations. She possesses {{a large amount of}} superhuman strength, which allowed her to knock a large <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> of the air with ease, match Ms. Marvel in hand-to-hand combat, and bloody Skaar's mouth with a single punch. Superia also possesses an enhanced resistance to damage, which allowed her to take repeated punches from Ms. Marvel, Skaar, and Luke Cage without harm, and is able to fly, with an unknown top speed. Finally, Superia has also shown the ability to generate powerful, green concussive energy blasts from her fists. By concentrating the power of her energy blasts, Superia was able to create a massive explosion that allowed her to escape from the New Avengers. Even without her powers, Superia has claimed to possess knowledge of martial arts.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is present}} at Reed Richards' {{test of the}} N-Zone Teleportation Device in the Nevada Desert. After a {{malfunction}} in the device, he wakes up in France in a hospital bed. He uncontrollably bursts into flames until he learns to control his powers by saying [...] "Flame On" [...] and [...] "Flame Off.". When Mole Man's creatures attacks, Johnny finds out he can fly while on fire. It is explained by Reed that Johnny's combustion makes him lighter than air. Johnny's body {{is covered with a}} microscopically thin film of transparent plates that make him impervious to flame. When he activates his powers, fat cells beneath his skin create clean nuclear fusion and <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> between the plates as plasma which then ignites on contact with air. Periodically, Johnny enters a hibernation where his old layer of skin peels off as ash while a new layer forms underneath. Unlike the mainstream Human Torch, Ultimate Johnny's power sometimes have detrimental effects on his health, specifically causing unhealthy levels of weight loss and exhaustion.|$|E

5000|$|On Tuesday 24 November 2015, Mariam Mukhtiar Shaikh and Squadron leader Saqib Abbasi were {{on their}} routine {{operational}} training mission when their plane FT-7PG crashed near Kundian, Punjab.. Both occupants ejected from the cockpit and the plane crash-landed. Abbasi suffered minor injuries in the accident, however Mukhtiar died of her injuries in a military hospital.Marium Mukhtiar ejected along with her co-pilot, but at too low an altitude, an air force spokesman said. She was losing height so when she ejected, {{she did not have}} appropriate height that is necessary for ejection,” the spokesman said. Her co-pilot, Squadron Leader Saqib Abbasi, survived with minor injuries, possibly because he managed to eject seconds earlier. Mukhtiar’s death was declared a martyrdom (or [...] "shahadat") by the PAF, which said both pilots “handled the serious emergency with professionalism and courage and tried to save the ill-fated aircraft until the very last minute. Flying Officer Mukhtiar could save her life had she ejected herself before taking PAF FT-7PG out of populous area but both pilots decided to take risk to keep flying the downing jet for taking the <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> of the densely populated area, especially saving a school. The delay in ejection caused martyrdom of Marium Mukhtar, said PAF experienced and retired officers.|$|E
5000|$|Clay began taunting and {{provoking}} Liston {{almost immediately}} after the two agreed to fight. He purchased a bus and had it emblazoned with the words [...] "Liston Must Go In Eight." [...] On {{the day of the}} contract signing, he drove it to Liston's home in Denver, waking the champion (with the press in tow) at 3:00 a.m. shouting, [...] "Come on out of there. I'm gonna whip you now." [...] Liston had just moved into a white neighborhood and was furious at the attention this caused. Clay took to driving his entourage in the bus to the site in Surfside, Florida where Liston (nicknamed the [...] "Big Bear") was training, and repeatedly called Liston the [...] "big, ugly bear". Liston grew increasingly irritated as the motor-mouthed Clay continued hurling insults ("After the fight, I'm gonna build myself a pretty home and use him as a bearskin rug. Liston even smells like a bear. I'm gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him... if Sonny Liston whups me, I'll kiss his feet in the ring, crawl out of the ring on my knees, tell him he's the greatest, and catch the next <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> of the country."). Clay insisted to a skeptical press that he would knock out Liston in eight rounds (Former Light Heavyweight Champion José Torres, in his 1971 biography of Ali, Sting Like a Bee, said that as of 1963, Ali's prophetic poems had correctly predicted the exact round he would stop an opponent 12 times).|$|E
5000|$|Dudley Puppy (voiced by Jerry Trainor) - He is {{the heart}} and soul of T.U.F.F. even though he's {{depicted}} as an idiotic, airheaded, hyperactive and loud white and black, mixed-breed dog who usually wears nothing more than a black T-shirt. Despite his lack of common sense he has been proven to be exceedingly clever (i.e. tricking the Chameleon into morphing into a mouse so that Agent Jumbo would jump on him out of fear). Dudley was first discovered by T.U.F.F. when he followed his recently acquired chew toy into D.O.O.M.'s headquarters where he unknowingly defeated Francisco, Bad Dog, and Leather Teddy at the time when Kitty Katswell was pursuing Verminious Snaptrap. Keswick's DNA analysis shows that Dudley is the [...] "perfect mix of every breed of dog known to man". Since each breed of dog has a special trait (like a beagle's appearance, a Bloodhound's sensitive nose, a Greyhound's speed, German Shepherd's brave heart, the fighting abilities of a Chinese Fighting Dog (Shar-Pei) the buff chest and arms of an Alaskan Malamute, the French-speaking of a French Poodle, the leaping abilities of a Springer. etc.), Dudley's overall natural skills makes him a formidable agent and he is made Kitty Katswell's partner. Dudley also has bad habits of being gluttonous and immature. Despite this eccentric personality, his bravery and advanced natural physical skills are an asset to T.U.F.F. in times of need and he can be pretty sensible when needed. He usually comes up with clever plans to stop his enemies, and he becomes more and more noble as time goes by. His catchphrase is [...] "Hi gee gee", and he often says it whenever he's ready to <b>jet</b> <b>out</b> of the area. A running gag consists of the fact he reads poorly and cannot spell or write. However, there have been many times that Dudley has demonstrated that he has these abilities. In the episode [...] "Snap Dad", it's revealed that Dudley's mother is still dating; the whereabouts of Dudley's father have not been revealed.|$|E
