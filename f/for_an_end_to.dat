5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people of Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery. The address called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and equitable distribution of the national debt and federal property.|$|E
5|$|After leaving government, Fraser {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in international relations with respect to independence for Namibia. In 1985, he chaired UN hearings in New York on the role of multinationals in South Africa and Namibia. Fraser also co-chaired the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group from 1985 to 1986, campaigning <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> apartheid in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E
50|$|The {{criterion}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> case (according to today's generative linguistic grammars of Hungarian) {{is that a}} {{word with}} that <b>ending</b> can be <b>a</b> compulsory argument of a verb.

5|$|In March 2012, {{hundreds}} of anti-nuclear demonstrators {{converged on the}} Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese {{community as well as}} Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|In a rare {{example of}} the {{political}} protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the Rokeby Venus was damaged on 10 March 1914 by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the Gallery to close until {{the start of the}} First World War, when the Women's Social and Political Union called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> violent acts drawing attention to their plight.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to litigation work, Weiquan lawyers like Gao Zhisheng have also advocated publicly {{and in the}} media for human rights for Falun Gong. In 2004 and 2005, Gao wrote a series of letters to China's top leadership detailing accounts of torture and sexual abuse against Falun Gong practitioners, and calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the persecution of the group. In response, Gao lost his legal license, was put under house arrest, detained, and was reportedly tortured.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|Sledd first gained {{national}} recognition {{after he}} wrote a 1902 magazine article advocating better legal and social treatment of African-Americans. He is also prominently remembered {{for his role in}} founding the modern University of Florida, his scholarly analysis of biblical texts as literature, his call <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> racial violence, and his influence on a generation of Methodist seminary students, scholars and ministers.|$|E
5|$|The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in Frankfort {{and chose}} Helm and John W. Stevenson as the party's {{candidates}} for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Helm resigned {{his seat in}} the state senate to accept the nomination. Though his health was frail, he determined to canvass the entire state. He continued his call <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> Civil War bitterness and proscriptions against those who had sided with the Confederacy. He won the general election over Republican Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the state monopoly on printing presses. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. Its character was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> {{the use of}} Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal {{of the past and}} prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E

5|$|In July 1997 the Provisional IRA {{called a}} ceasefire. On 10 October 1997 a Provisional IRA General Army Convention {{was held in}} Falcarragh, County Donegal. At the convention, Provisional IRA Quartermaster General Michael McKevitt—also {{a member of the}} 12-person Provisional IRA Executive—denounced the {{leadership}} and called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the group's ceasefire and to its participation in the Northern Ireland peace process. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member Bernadette Sands McKevitt. The two dissidents were outmanoeuvred by the leadership and were left isolated. The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with other members.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, which called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, {{but it was}} rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded {{under pressure from the}} Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials {{closely linked to the}} discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers without worrying about maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the civil war.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights call <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> {{the use of}} Native American mascots {{was only}} for {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have {{a substantial number of}} native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E
