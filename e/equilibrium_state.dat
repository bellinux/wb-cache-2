5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal <b>equilibrium</b> <b>state</b> allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|While American economists quickly {{abandoned}} disequilibrium models, European economists {{were more}} open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Drèze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>state</b> in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case {{is almost impossible to}} achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>state</b> {{under which}} investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem in the}} dimension theory of self-affine sets is the construction of high- dimensional measures which yield sharp lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of the set. A natural strategy {{for the construction of}} such high-dimensional measures is to investigate measures of maximal Lyapunov dimension; these measures can be alternatively interpreted as <b>equilibrium</b> <b>states</b> of the singular value function introduced by Falconer. Whilst the existence of these <b>equilibrium</b> <b>states</b> has been well-known for some years their structure has remained elusive, particularly in dimensions higher than two. In this article we give a complete description of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>states</b> of the singular value function in the three-dimensional case, showing in particular that all such <b>equilibrium</b> <b>states</b> must be fully supported. In higher dimensions we also give a new sufficient condition for the uniqueness of these <b>equilibrium</b> <b>states.</b> As a corollary, giving a solution to a folklore open question in dimension three, we prove that for a typical self-affine set in R 3, removing one of the affine maps which defines the set results in a strict reduction of the Hausdorff dimension...|$|R
