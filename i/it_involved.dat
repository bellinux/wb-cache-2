40|$|Simply stated, I am {{attempting}} {{to discover what}} "architecture" is.

In addition, the thesis attempts to recognize "architecture" as having three components: architecture as philosophy, based upon convictions and revealing meaning; architecture as art, inspiring aesthetics; and architecture as science, involving constructability and technology.

5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. <b>It</b> <b>involved</b> observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E
5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was so fierce that <b>it</b> <b>involved</b> last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage.

Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as <b>it</b> <b>involved</b> the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
