40|$|An {{appropriate}} type of {{dilution tunnel}} is chosen, {{based on the}} international standards, user's needs and the manufacturer's requirements. During the design process, a number of restrictions specified in the standards for emission and Venturis were taken into account. The data required to address basic concepts were obtained from numerous emission tests performed at the IMR Institute. A short algorithm of calculation of the critical flow Venturi (CFV) is also presented. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the problems of the measurement of particulate emissions using the dilution method, which does not allow us to use the unique thermodynamic and flow parameters. A method of evaluation of particulate emissions for two extreme cases which were expected during the tests was adopted. Using the results of calculations, a <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> tunnel with CFV was manufactured and tested at the IMR Institute...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full flow and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full flow, partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> tunnel. The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full flow and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|The {{heavy duty}} Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) inter-laboratory {{exercise}} {{consists of three}} parts: 1) the exploratory work to refine the measurement protocol, 2) the validation exercise where each lab will measure the emissions of a ¿golden¿ engine with two ¿golden¿ particle number systems simultaneously sampling from <b>full</b> and partial <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> systems, and 3) the round-robin where the emissions of a ¿reference¿ engine will be determined with a lab¿s own particle number instrumentation. This paper {{presents the results of}} the exploratory work and describes the final protocol for testing in the validation exercise (and round robin) along with the necessary facility modifications required for compliance with the protocol. Key aspects of the protocol (e. g. filter material, flow rates at the <b>full</b> and partial <b>flow</b> systems, the pre-conditioning etc.) are explained and justified. Finally, the results of particle emissions measurements during the World harmonized and the European cycles are given focusing on volatility and the presence of non-volatile materials above and below 23 nm.

40|$|The Heavy-duty Inter-Laboratory Correlation Exercise has {{concluded}} testing at 5 test laboratories in the EU {{in order to}} demonstrate the practicality, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility of the particle emissions measurement techniques proposed by the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). A CRT equipped heavy duty engine was transported to each lab were it was tested over multiple European and the World Harmonized Stationary and Transient Test Cycles. Along with the engine, two Golden Particle Measurement Systems (GPMS) were shipped to permit particle number {{measurements to be made}} simultaneously from both <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> constant volume sampler (CVS) <b>dilution</b> and partial <b>flow</b> <b>dilution</b> (PFDS) systems.

The scope of the experiment and the techniques employed are discussed and an assessment is made of the accuracy of results. Measurements of the external drag of rectangular intakes installed {{on the sides of}} a fuselage are presented. Results at subsonic speeds show that drag at <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> is independent of compressmn surface geometry, so that substantial flow spillage may be achieved for little drag penalty provided that the intake throat Mach number is kept high by elevation of the compression surface. For a given total turning of the flow by th 2 compression surface, splllage drag is found to be uniquely related to the inlet mass flow ratio (as distinct from capture mass flow ratlo).
