5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> This problem {{does not seem to have}} been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is a proper divisor {{of the product}} of the other integers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> indexing rows, and every element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

30|$|Venous {{infarction}} {{carries a}} high risk of morbidity and mortality, and can occur when venous egress from the brain is compromised. This entity most commonly occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of cortical vein and/or dural venous sinus thrombosis. High flow shunt lesions resulting in venous hypertension can also result in venous infarct. Intracranial haemorrhage occurs more frequently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of venous infarction compared with arterial infarct, possibly because arterial input pressure continues unabated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of a compromised blood brain barrier. Systemic anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment [11, 12], even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of haemorrhage, and endovascular therapy with thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy [13, 14] of the dural venous sinuses has emerged as a therapeutic option.|$|R

40|$|Pancreatic {{necrosis}} is {{a serious}} complication of acute pancreatitis (AP) that occurs in 10 - 20 % of patients. It is a local complication involving pancreatic parenchyma, surrounding soft tissue and possibly extending to adjacent organs. Societal guidelines acknowledge pancreatic necrosis to be a marker for severity, associated with greater length of hospitalization, need for invasive interventions, mortality, and elevated risk for readmission following discharge when contrasted to patients with interstitial pancreatitis [1, 2]. Pancreatic necrosis is associated with fluid collections. The revised Atlanta Classification distinguishes fluid collections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of AP into two categories: collections that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of interstitial pancreatitis or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of pancreatic necrosis.

40|$|Objective: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy. Most studies report data from regions of social disadvantage and low education. We {{report on the}} levels of anxiety, depression {{and quality of life}} of fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy in an area where the unemployment rate is low. Methods: Observational study of 50 fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy and 100 fathers whose partners were not teenagers (control), living within the same metropolitan healthcare region with high employment rates. Fathers were enrolled within the larger Australian Father’s Study and were recruited from antenatal clinics and community settings. Researchers administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and demographic questionnaires. Results: Fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy were significantly younger than control fathers (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). After adjusting for demographic variables, fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy did not have levels of anxiety, depression or quality of life that were significantly different to control fathers. Conclusion: Fathers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of maternal teenage pregnancy, when engaged in further education or employment have levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life comparable to control fathers...|$|R

5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} sets {{of numbers}} such that each number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> divides but is not equal to the product {{of all the other}} numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
