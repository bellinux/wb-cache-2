A slightly acidic medium was preferable for the process efficiency for MTBE, whereas a neutral medium was beneficial for <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents</b> and jet fuel aqueous extracts.

This dissertation presents the impact of highway runoff to soil and groundwater. The dissertation is composed of two major distinct parts. ^ First part assessed the bacterial community diversity in highway runoff contaminated sediment from an infiltration basin located in Plymouth, MA that had undergone nineteen years of acetate-based <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents</b> addition followed by three years of acetate-free <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents.</b> Sediment sample from four drilled soil cores collected in two field events documented the change in bacterial community structure with depth and distance from the infiltration basin origin. ^ To meet the objective, a variety of multi-disciplinary techniques were employed. Soil samples were collected, using drilling and core barrel / freeze-shoe coring methods, from different locations and depths to obtain vertical profiles of bacterial distribution along groundwater plume. Analyses of groundwater dissolved oxygen and pH, physical and chemical properties of the soil complemented molecular phylogenetic determinations to distinguish ambient and contaminated plume zones. ^ Analysis of sediment samples from four drilled soil cores by means of 16 S rDNA PCR indicated an overall high bacterial diversity both into the plume and into the ambient aquifer, with no prominent members within the communities.

40|$|AbstractSnow and ice {{during the}} winter period {{is one of the}} main factors for low skid {{resistance}} resulting in elevated road accident levels and economic cost. Winter maintenance with the application of sodium chloride causes ecological damage due to chloride in road run-off. However these salt application in combination with snow ploughing is, for lack of alternatives, the weapon of choice for road authorities in order to maintain safe roads. The timing and amount of scattered <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents,</b> e. g. sodium chloride, is commonly decided by the winter service vehicle driver based on experience and/or rigid tables. With this common neglect of the variable environmental factors such as traffic intensity, precipitation, surface temperature and gradient, suboptimal results are very likely. Based on an intense research program and statistical analysis funded by all regional and national road authorities in Austria, a model to simulate the impact of these factors on skid resistance was developed. The key factor is the determination of the residual salt depending on traffic and precipitation over time, resulting in an increased freezing point of water on the road. The goal of salting is to lower the freezing point of the brine on the road below surface temperature, thus preventing freezing with significantly lowered skid resistance. Based on the presented model, it is possible to simulate the impact of winter maintenance and optimize the timing and amount of applied <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents</b> under any condition over time. Excessive or unnecessary treatments can be detected in the simulation process and therefore be eliminated by specific instructions leading to optimized winter maintenance with decreasing costs, ecological damage and consumption of resources without lowering the level of safety...|$|R
40|$|Some {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to investigate the cyclic freeze-thaw deterioration of concrete, using traditional and non-traditional techniques. Two concrete mixes, with different pore structure, were tested in order to compare {{the behavior of a}} freeze-thaw resistant concrete from one that is not. One of the concretes was air entrained, high content of cement and low w/c ratio, and the other one was a lower cement content and higher w/c ratio, without air-entraining agent. Concrete specimens were studied under cyclic freeze-thaw conditions according to UNE-CENT/TS 12390 - 9 test, using 3 % NaCl solution as freezing medium (CDF test: Capillary Suction, <b>De-icing</b> <b>agent</b> and Freeze-thaw Test). The temperature and relative humidity were measured during the cycles inside the specimens using embedded sensors placed at different heights from the surface in contact with the <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> solution. Strain gauges were used to measure the strain variations at the surface of the specimens. Also, measurements of ultrasonic pulse velocity through the concrete specimens were taken before, during, and after the freeze-thaw cycles. According to the CDF test, the failure of the non-air-entraining agent concrete was observed before 28 freeze-thaw cycles; contrariwise, the scaling of the air-entraining agent concrete was only 0. 10 kg/m 2 after 28 cycles, versus 3. 23 kg/m 2 in the deteriorated concrete, after 28 cycles. Similar behavior was observed on the strain measurements. The residual strain in the deteriorated concrete after 28 cycles was 1150 m versus 65 m, in the air-entraining agent concrete.

Nevertheless, a slightly higher conductivity was observed at the SSB effluent, which is most likely due to the use of sodium chloride as <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> in winter periods [28]. However, the chloride concentration and the conductivity were only slightly increased at the exposure site and indicated a sufficient dilution by the Argen River. Consequently, there is no clear evidence of an influence of the SSB on the salinity of the Argen River.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen roads {{may become}} dangerously {{slippery}} due to frost, ice or snow, local authorities treat the roads by spreading a <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> (usually salt) on them. In order {{to treat a}} road, a winter gritting vehicle must travel down the road once, spreading salt on to {{both sides of the}} carriageway. An application is described where routes were constructed for gritters in a local authority area. The formulation of the model is presented which involves dealing with multiple depot locations, limited vehicle capacities, and roads with different priorities (for example, some must be treated within two hours and others within four hours of the start of gritting). The objective function to be optimised depends on both the total distance travelled, and the number and capacity of the gritters. The solution method is a heuristic algorithm, which involves, as a first stage, the optimal solution of an unconstrained Chinese Postman Problem for the network, and followed by the use of Simulated Annealing for the constrained problem...|$|E

40|$|Freeze-thaw {{testing methods}} with {{different}} grade of severity {{have been applied}} to investigate the durability of – intentionally non air entrained – fibre reinforced concretes (FRC) mixed with nominally zero, 25, 50 and 75 kg/m 3 cold drawn steel fibres (30 / 0. 5 mm). Concrete specimens were made with sulphate resistant Portland cement and were stored 28 days in water and under laboratory conditions afterwards. The mineralogical changes of hardened cement paste, the chloride absorption, the changes of the specific electrical resistance and the watertightness were studied to complete the usual mechanical properties tests (strength, Young’s modulus, etc.). It can be concluded that an increasing dosage of steel fibres diminishes the loss of mass (e. g. scaling off) of FRC, but fibres themselves can not hinder the severe damage of the exposed surfaces and can not provide freeze-thaw and <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> resistant concrete {{if it is not}} air entrained.

40|$|Abstract: We {{measure and}} model the steady {{transport}} of specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen through a groundwater plume from a highway infiltration basin in southeastern Massachusetts. Specific conductivity {{is treated as}} a conservative surrogate for runoff contamination, and the data calibrate a 0. 27 -m vertical dispersivity � of the aquifer and the bottom streamline elevation of the plume, which falls to an 8 -m depth below the water table. The dissolved oxygen degrades as a first order reactant in the plume to levels below 1 mg/L, with a decay constant � of 0. 12 day − 1. The latter may be attributed {{in part to the}} historical use of an alternative <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> calcium magnesium acetate on the highway, since acetate is a readily biodegradable substrate for microorganisms. The calibrated kinetics suggest that plume microbes and geochemistry degrade oxygen over two orders of magnitude faster than their ambient groundwater counterparts, which impose a linear decrease of dissolved oxygen concentration below the plume.

The report consists of introduction, literature review, description of materials and methods, discussion of results and conclusions. TiO 2 was selected as a photocatalyst for the experiments with synthetic solutions of ethylene glycol, 2 -ethoxyethanol and aqueous extract of jet fuel. To explain the PCO mechanisms affecting certain behaviour of <b>de-icing</b> <b>agent</b> under distinctive conditions, the following factors were studied: the impact of initial concentration of pollutant, the role of pH, the presence of tert-butanol as OH·-radicals scavenger and mineral admixtures. PCO under solar radiation performed in two ways: catalysed by irradiated TiO 2 slurry or by TiO 2 attached to buoyant hollow glass micro-spheres. Special attention was paid to the energy-saving PCO with reduced intensity mixing of the slurry. The effect of PCO was assessed by determination of residual chemical oxygen demand of solution (COD) and by measuring of concentration of glycols. The PCO process efficiency was assumed to be dependent on the TiO 2 suspension fractional composition. Thus, the following effects of solutions’ media were viewed: presence of organic admixtures, pH influence, mixing mode during the PCO. The effects of mineral admixtures - Ca 2 +, Fe 3 +/ 2 +, Mn 2 +, SO 42 - - that are often present in natural and wastewater systems or produced during the degradation of organic pollutants and which can affect the rate of PCO of de-icing agents, were also investigated...|$|E

40|$|As the {{construction}} sector uses 50 % of the earth’s raw material and produces 50 % of its waste, {{the development of}} more durable and sustainable building products is crucial. Since Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) is mostly inert material, it is nowadays used as recycled aggregates, but only in low-value concrete applications. On the other hand, the general trend today for the cement industries is the use of alternative raw materials for the production of cement clinker. Considering these aspects and the aim for high-value recycling of CDW, the concept of Completely Recyclable Concrete (CRC) has been developed. After demolition of a construction, the material’s life cycle is closed as the CRC-rubble is given a second life as raw material for cement production, without need for adjustments. Therefore, the concrete mixture is designed to be chemically equivalent to raw material for cement production by adequately incorporating limestone aggregates, different types of cement and industrial by-products. For environment friendly building products, not only the closure of the material’s life cycle, but also the quality of the product is of great importance. Therefore, three durability aspects were investigated for two types of CRC: the resistance to carbonation, chloride penetration and freeze-thaw attack with <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

Pressure and temperature variations during take-off and landing produce considerable stress on aircraft structures, promoting moisture ingress (by diffusion through fibers or by direct ingress through voids, cracks or unsealed joints) into the core. The presence of water (or other fluids such as kerosene, hydraulic fluid and <b>de-icing</b> <b>agents)</b> in any of its forms (gas vapor, liquid or ice) promotes corrosion, cell breakage, and induce composite layer delaminations and skin disbonds.
