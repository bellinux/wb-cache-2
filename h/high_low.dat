25|$|N'Ko uses diacritical {{marks to}} denote {{tonality}} and vowel length. Together with plain vowels, N'Ko distinguishes four tones: <b>high,</b> <b>low,</b> ascending, and descending; and two vowel lengths: long and short. However no mark exists for a short, descending tone.|$|E
25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent chip select line for each slave. A pull-up resistor between power source and chip select line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (<b>high,</b> <b>low</b> or high-impedance).|$|E
50|$|While Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings control {{approximately}} 95% of {{the credit}} ratings business, {{they are not the}} only rating agencies. DBRS's long-term ratings scale is somewhat similar to Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings with the words <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> replacing the + and −. It goes as follows, from excellent to poor: AAA, AA (<b>high),</b> AA, AA (<b>low),</b> A (<b>high),</b> A, A (<b>low),</b> BBB (<b>high),</b> BBB, BBB (<b>low),</b> BB (<b>high),</b> BB, BB (<b>low),</b> B (<b>high),</b> B, B (<b>low),</b> CCC (<b>high),</b> CCC, CCC (<b>low),</b> CC (<b>high),</b> CC, CC (<b>low),</b> C (<b>high),</b> C, C (<b>low)</b> and D. The short-term ratings often map to long-term ratings though there is room for exceptions at the <b>high</b> or <b>low</b> side of each equivalent.|$|R
50|$|A {{trend is}} {{established}} once {{the market has}} formed three or four consecutive legs, e.g. for a bull trend, higher <b>highs</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>lows.</b> The <b>higher</b> <b>highs,</b> <b>higher</b> <b>lows,</b> lower <b>highs</b> and lower <b>lows</b> can only be identified after the next bar has closed. Identifying it before {{the close of the}} bar risks that the market will act contrary to expectations, move beyond the price of the potential higher/lower bar and leave the trader aware only that the supposed turning point was an illusion.|$|R
50|$|Pateley Bridge is {{the largest}} {{settlement}} in the civil parish of <b>High</b> and <b>Low</b> Bishopside, historically a township in the large parish of Ripon. <b>High</b> and <b>Low</b> Bishopside was created a civil parish in 1866. Pateley Bridge was granted town status in 1986, and the <b>High</b> and <b>Low</b> Bishopside Parish Council was renamed Pateley Bridge Town Council. However, the official name of the parish remains <b>High</b> and <b>Low</b> Bishopside.|$|R
25|$|A {{factorial}} experiment is a statistically structured experiment in which several factors (watering levels, antibiotics, fertilizers, etc.) {{are applied to}} each experimental unit at varying (but integral) levels (<b>high,</b> <b>low,</b> or various intermediate levels). In a full {{factorial experiment}} all combinations of levels of the factors need to be tested, but to minimize confounding influences the levels should be varied within any experimental run.|$|E
25|$|All Otomi {{languages}} are tonal, and most varieties have three tones, <b>high,</b> <b>low</b> and rising. One {{variety of the}} Sierra dialect, that of San Gregorio, has been analyzed as having a fourth, falling tone. In Mezquital Otomi, suffixes are never specified for tone, while in Tenango Otomi, the only syllables not specified for tone are prepause syllables and the last syllable of polysyllabic words.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} picture is often {{dominated by the}} underlying cause.The symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function {{that are associated with}} the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Marked increases in the potassium level can lead to abnormal heart rhythms, which can be severe and life-threatening. Fluid balance is frequently affected, though blood pressure can be <b>high,</b> <b>low</b> or normal.|$|E

When the clock reaches the half way point ("half-tide"), it then counts the hours up to <b>high</b> tide or <b>low</b> tide, as in [...] "one hour until <b>high</b> or <b>low</b> tide".

After the Norman Conquest the modern area known as Macclesfield Forest formed part of the much larger region of the Royal forest of Macclesfield, a hunting reserve owned by the Earls of Chester, which formerly stretched from the foothills of the Pennines east into the High Peak near Whaley Bridge and south to the Staffordshire Moorlands.|$|E
25|$|BITS {{provides}} API {{access to}} control jobs. A job can be programmatically started, stopped, paused, resumed, and queried for status. Before starting a job, a priority {{has to be}} set for it to specify when the job is processed relative to other jobs in the transfer queue. By default, all jobs are of Normal priority. Jobs can optionally be set to <b>High,</b> <b>Low,</b> or Foreground priority. Background transfers are optimized by BITS, which increases and decreases (or throttles) the rate of transfer based {{on the amount of}} idle network bandwidth that is available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, BITS decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive experience, except for Foreground priority downloads.|$|E

500|$|Pyramid B3 is {{actually}} two pyramids built upon a single basal platform. Together they comprise {{the most important}} architectural unit in Group B. The northern pyramid of the pair is denominated B3a; the southern is B3b. The two pyramids each have five stepped levels and face west onto the plaza. Each pyramid was accessed by a single stairway flanked by wide balustrades; each had a small altar {{at the base of}} its stairway. Both stairways had nineteen steps and the pyramids stand [...] <b>high.</b> <b>Low</b> platforms on their summits indicate where the temple buildings once stood. The double form of the twin pyramids had its origin in the Valley of Mexico and indicates foreign influences at the city. A broken stela was excavated from within the fill of Pyramid B3a; it was a plain monument broken in two parts. The bottom section still stood, while the upper section was lying beside it. It is one of very few such monuments raised in the Maya highlands and such stelae are characteristic of the Classic Period (c. 250–900). It is possible that it stands where originally erected before the pyramid was built over it. A funerary urn was excavated from underneath the rear of Pyramid B3b.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not within}} the scope of this paper, however, to discuss {{technical}} criteria by which hypotheses are given <b>high,</b> <b>low,</b> or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, {{but at the same time}} is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific [...] "orthodoxy" [...] may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of [...] "pseudo-science."

Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense.|$|E
