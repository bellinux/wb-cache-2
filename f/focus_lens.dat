5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E

40|$|The encircled {{energy of}} a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> {{is one of the}} {{parameters}} directly affecting the target efficiency in high-power laser facilities. The direct measurement method of the encircled energy for the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> based on the scanning Hartmann test is proposed in this paper. With the scanning Hartmann test setup, the information in the whole aperture of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> can be achieved. The encircled energy can be obtained by analyzing the spot diagram on the focal plane of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> In experiments, the encircled {{energy of a}}n aspheric <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> is measured using this method. The measurement result is in good agreement with that derived from measurement data by an interferometer and the difference is 7. 7 %. (C) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Aiming at {{the demand}} on X-ray pulsar {{navigation}} and X-ray space communication, the multilayer nested X-ray focusing optical device is developed and tested. Theoretical design of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is carried out}} according {{to the principle of}} grazing incidence, and key parameters of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> are determined. The materials of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> and the preparation technologies such as the coating process are discussed. The performance parameters of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> are tested respectively under the conditions of visible light and X-ray. The results show that the spot diameter of visible light is 14 mm, the spot diameter of X-ray is 20 mm, and the focusing efficiency is 30. 2 %. The effective area is 2400 mm 2 in a 10 m vacuum pipe when the photon energy is 1. 5 keV. © 2016, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved...|$|R

50|$|Overhead {{projectors}} normally {{include a}} manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers {{the position of}} the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the <b>lens)</b> to <b>focus</b> at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This permits a range of projection distances.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> (sometimes {{known as}} IF) is a photographic lens design in which focus is shifted {{by moving the}} inner lens group or groups only, without any rotation or shifting of the front lens element. This {{makes it easy to}} use, for example, a screwed-in polarizing filter or a petal shaped lens hood. During macro photography, using an internal <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> reduces the risk of the front of the lens accidentally hitting the subject during focusing as the front element does not move.|$|E

50|$|An {{overhead}} projector {{works on the}} same principle as a 35mm slide projector, in which a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally {{the size of a}} printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and <b>focusing</b> <b>lens),</b> in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side opposite the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{physical}} size of {{an internal}} <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> does not change during focus, nor does {{the front of the}} lens rotate. This is particularly useful for large lenses, keeping the size more compact, or when using filters or accessories mounted {{on the front of the}} lens that may require careful alignment.One issue internal <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> can have is that the true focal length of the lens is reduced when not focused at infinity.|$|R

50|$|For proper {{functioning}} of the electron gun, {{it is necessary that}} the beam be perfectly adjusted with respect to the optical axes of the accelerating electrical lens and the magnetic <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This can be done by applying a magnetic field of some specific radial direction and strength perpendicular to the optical axis before the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This is usually realized by a simple correction system consisting of two pairs of coils.
