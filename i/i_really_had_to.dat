It was quite easy." [...] Clarkson also admitted that [...] "Because of You" [...] is the most depressing song she has ever written. Despite the revelation, she told Entertainment Weekly in August 2011 {{that she wanted to}} be remembered for the song because she had to work hard to get it on Breakaway (2004) when everyone was against it. She added, [...] "I think I’m most proud of that song – just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit no. 1 worldwide and everybody was on board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jennifer Judith Jones {{was born}} to Larry and Carol Jones who were both curlers. She also has a sister named Heather 18 months older. During her childhood, she was often {{described}} as [...] "shy". Larry Jones started teaching Jones when she was 11 although Jones' interest of the sport took up before that, in a daycare at the St. Vital Curling Club. She attended General Vanier School in South Winnipeg from kindergarten to grade 8. After, she attended Windsor Park Collegiate. At that point, Jones was proficient at Volleyball and Curling. [...] "When I {{was in high school}} <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a choice and it was actually my volleyball coach who told me I had to choose either volleyball or curling, and I chose curling."

2500|$|Several {{months later}} in July {{of the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. I {{wanted to make sure that}} I expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson came {{to teach}} at Howard University after {{delivering}} a lecture there in February 1979. Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning. Robinson has long advocated equal access for African-American architects, but argues that black architects should seek work {{where they can get}} it. [...] "I don't want to ask for anything. It's embarrassing to me," [...] he told Newsday in 1991. [...] "I have a new sense of being a radical. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to,</b> with the barrage of negative press and complaints of what we don't have. I'm tired of it. ... We simply aren't going to get large corporate work. That's a different network. But we have our own network. We have the black church, we have the black sororities and fraternities. Of course we want equal access, but no profession is without its barriers." ...|$|E

I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E

She not merely loftily forgave him, she had apparently minimized the offense, and this hurt worst of all.

He lurked in my chambers for a week while the new dress suit was a-making--his old one <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> remonstrate against--and then we went out to be admired. During the week's retirement he secreted quite a wealth of things to say--appropriate remarks on edibles, on music, on popular books, on conversation, off-hand little things, jotting them down in a note-book as they came into his mind, for he had a high conception of social intercourse, and the public expectation. He was ever a methodical little gentleman, and all these accumulations that he could not get into his talk, he proposed to put away for the big volume of [...] "Reminiscences" [...] that was to round off his life. At last he was a mere conversational firework, crammed with latent wit and jollity, and ready to blaze and sparkle in fizzing style as soon as the light of social intercourse should touch him.|$|E
6000|$|It was at Suva, in the Fijis, that I {{discharged}} {{my third}} and last captain {{and took up}} gain the role of amateur navigator. I had essayed it once before, under my first captain, who, out of San Francisco, jumped the Snark so amazingly over the chart that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{find out what was}} doing. It was fairly easy to find out, for we had a run of twenty-one hundred miles before us. I knew nothing of navigation; but, after several hours of reading up and half an hour's practice with the sextant, I was able to find the Snark's latitude by meridian observation and her longitude by the simple method known as [...] "equal altitudes." [...] This is not a correct method. It is not even a safe method, but my captain was attempting to navigate by it, and {{he was the only one}} on board who should have been able to tell me that it was a method to be eschewed. I brought the Snark to Hawaii, but the conditions favoured me. The sun was in northern declination and nearly overhead. The legitimate [...] "chronometer-sight" [...] method of ascertaining the longitude I had not heard of--yes, I had heard of it. My first captain mentioned it vaguely, but after one or two attempts at practice of it he mentioned it no more.|$|E

I daresay that the fault is mine, but the fact remains--we are sisters but we are not intimate. Well, my brother fell ill of a fever, {{and for a long time}} he lay between life and death, and I prayed for him as I never prayed for anybody or anything before--yes, I prayed that I might die instead of him. Then he passed through the crisis and got better, and I thanked God, thinking that my prayers had been answered; oh, how happy I was for those ten days! And then this happened:--My brother got a chill, a relapse followed, and in three days he was dead. The last words that he spoke to me were, 'Oh, don't let me die, Bee!'--he used to call me Bee--'Please don't let me die, dear Bee!' But he died, died in my arms, and when it was over I rose from his side feeling as though my heart was dead also. I prayed no more after that. It seemed to me as though my prayers had been mocked at, as though he had been given back to me for a little while in order that the blow might be more crushing when it fell." ...|$|E
