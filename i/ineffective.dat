5|$|As such, {{out of the}} 44 provinces in South Vietnam, 10 were {{occupied}} by the Vietnam People's Army, and three ARVN infantry divisions were rendered <b>ineffective.</b> In addition, the elite ARVN 147th Marines Brigade ceased to exist as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gastroenterology Association in Las Vegas, several papers are {{presented}} which suggest that acid control via H2 blockers is <b>ineffective</b> at curing PUD.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} used for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), {{although they are}} generally believed <b>ineffective</b> for this indication. Effectiveness was, however, found in one small study. Benzodiazepines {{can be considered as}} a treatment option in treatment resistant cases.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam's non-violent methods {{proved to}} be <b>ineffective</b> against Snihalese-Buddhist {{nationalism}} and failed to secure Tamils' rights from successive governments. With his death the era of non-violent protest was replaced by violent militancy.|$|E
5|$|Having {{completed}} the anti-bureaucratic revolution in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured {{four out of}} eight federal presidency votes in 1991, which rendered the governing body <b>ineffective</b> as other republics objected and called for reform of the Federation.|$|E
5|$|His overall bowling {{performance}} was strong, with 34 wickets at 23.18, although his batting was <b>ineffective,</b> with only 213 runs at 15.21 and a top-score of 30.|$|E
5|$|Many {{observers}} took {{a moderate}} tone in their reaction, acknowledging that funding {{should be provided}} for further national missile defense tests, but also saying that the US should not rush into developing technology that might prove <b>ineffective</b> and too costly.|$|E
5|$|Maury Ginsberg plays Mr. Lewinsky, Hal's vain speech {{therapist}} who offers no successful advice. The character {{was based on}} Blitz's own experiences as a youth with many well-meaning but mostly <b>ineffective</b> therapists when he sought treatments to his stutter.|$|E
5|$|P. labiata will {{sometimes}} approach a translucent nest containing another spider, and will usually wait facing the prey {{for up to}} several hours. Occasionally P. labiata leaps at the prey in the nest, but this is <b>ineffective.</b>|$|E
5|$|September 1939 to May 1940: Air patrol, in {{an attempt}} to enforce a {{comprehensive}} no-fly ban issued by the Swiss government to the combatants, made largely <b>ineffective</b> by a 5–kilometer buffer along the border which Swiss fighters were forbidden to enter.|$|E
5|$|Some {{stakeholders}} {{have criticized}} the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for its generous free allocations of emission units {{and the lack of}} a carbon price signal (the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment), and for being <b>ineffective</b> in reducing emissions (Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand).|$|E
5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by <b>ineffective</b> hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, <b>ineffective</b> hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E
5|$|The LTTE, {{also known}} as Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, an insurgent group in Sri Lanka used CS gas against {{government}} forces in September 2008. Its use hindered the army's progress but ultimately proved <b>ineffective</b> in preventing the army from overrunning LTTE positions.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be <b>ineffective</b> and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It may be combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are <b>ineffective</b> at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely <b>ineffective</b> as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} <b>ineffective,</b> {{it has been}} seen as the first piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved <b>ineffective</b> in {{stopping}} the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved <b>ineffective.</b> Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered <b>ineffective</b> as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are <b>ineffective</b> for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used {{strategic}} methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive their opponents of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench to render the enemy cavalry <b>ineffective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, {{rendered}} the Georgia Bulldogs' running game, including that of fullback Herdis McCrary, <b>ineffective</b> {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified the Gators as legitimate contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be <b>ineffective,</b> and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be <b>ineffective</b> and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be <b>ineffective</b> for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be <b>ineffective</b> and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Smith's already-heavy {{drinking}} {{was being}} compounded {{with use of}} antidepressants. At {{the end of the}} Either/Or tour, some of his close friends staged an intervention in Chicago, but it proved <b>ineffective.</b> Shortly after, Smith relocated from Portland to Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Custer {{used his}} 2nd and 3rd (Capehart's) brigades {{for two more}} <b>ineffective</b> attacks. Finally, Custer made a rare night attack using his entire division. Strong {{moonlight}} reduced the risk of getting lost or misidentifying friendly and enemy soldiers. The night attack was successful, and Custer's division captured 24 to 30 artillery pieces. About 1,000 Confederates were taken prisoner, and 150 to 200 wagons were captured.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been <b>ineffective</b> at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{tellurium}} is {{not considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become <b>ineffective</b> due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was <b>ineffective</b> in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally <b>ineffective</b> in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electron}}s, one fewer than neon, and electron configuration 1s22s22p5: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled. The outer electrons are <b>ineffective</b> at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.|$|E
5|$|Galena {{departed}} Hampton Roads on 19 May 1863 {{and arrived}} at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two days later, where she was decommissioned for repairs and reconstruction. Most of her <b>ineffective</b> armor was removed, except around the engines and boilers; her armament was increased to eight nine-inch Dahlgren guns and a single 100-pounder Parrot rifle, and she was rebuilt as a ship-rigged sloop with three masts.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are <b>ineffective</b> and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be <b>ineffective.</b> The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed.|$|E
5|$|Henry left Monaco in January 1999, {{one year}} before his {{intimate}} and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian Serie A club Juventus for £10.5million. He played on the wing, but he was <b>ineffective</b> against the Serie A defensive discipline in a position uncharacteristic for him, and scored just three goals in 16 appearances.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This proved to be <b>ineffective</b> as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
