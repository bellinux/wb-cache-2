40|$|Background: In March 2007, the Hong Kong Government halved {{its heavy}} excise taxes on beer and wine, and 1 year later, it {{eliminated}} all duties on these beverages. This study examines {{the impact of}} such duty reductions on cardiovascular disease (CVD) -related mortality among the elderly in Hong Kong. Methods: Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average intervention time series analyses were applied to monthly morality data from 2001 to 2010 to quantify the impacts of <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> and exemption on CVD death rates among those aged 65 years or older. Results: The alcohol <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> in March 2007 was associated with an estimated 13 % increase (95 % CI 2 % to 24 %) in CVD death rates among elderly men, after controlling for the other intervention, outlier, trends and seasonal variations. This was equivalent to an extra 11 CVD deaths per 100 000 elderly men each month. Much of the observed impacts on CVD death rates {{were found to have}} contributed only by that on ischaemic heart disease mortality (18 % increase in rate for men (95 % CI 4 % to 34 %); 15 % increase for women (95 % CI 0. 4 % to 31 %)), not by mortality due to stroke or hypertension. The alcohol duty exemption on March 2008 was not found to have impacted the CVD death rates. Conclusions: The increase in CVD death rates among the Chinese elderly after alcohol <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> suggest that the purported beneficial effect of moderate alcohol use may not apply to certain Chinese populations, adding fuel to the ongoing debate on the risks and benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|To {{delineate}} the temporal dynamics between alcohol tax policy changes and related health outcomes, {{this study examined}} the age, period and cohort effects on alcohol-related mortality in relation to changes in government alcohol policies. We used the age-period-cohort modeling to analyze retrospective mortality data over 30 years from 1981 to 2010 in a rapidly developed Chinese population, Hong Kong. Alcohol-related mortality from 1) chronic causes, 2) acute causes, 3) all (chronic+acute) causes and 4) causes 100 % attributable to alcohol, as defined according to the Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) criteria developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were examined. The findings illustrated the possible effects of alcohol policy changes on adult alcohol-related mortality. The age-standardized mortality trends were generally in decline, with fluctuations that coincided with the timing of the alcohol policy changes. The age-period-cohort analyses demonstrated possible temporal dynamics between alcohol policy changes and alcohol-related mortality through the period effects, and also generational impact of alcohol policy changes through the cohort effects. Based on the illustrated association between the dramatic increase of alcohol imports in the mid- 1980 s and the increased alcohol-related mortality risk of the generations coming of age of majority at that time, attention should be paid to generations coming of drinking age during the 2007 - 2008 <b>duty</b> <b>reduction...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of the impacts of trade policy reforms in Sri Lanka. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed with detailed description of the domestic production structure and foreign trade. The model is then used to investigate the effects of trade policy reforms on resource allocation and welfare. ^ Prior to 1977, Sri Lanka maintained stringent control over its imports through rigid quantitative restrictions. A new economic policy reform package was introduced in 1977, and it shifted Sri Lanka 2 ̆ 7 s development strategy toward an export oriented policy regime. The shift of policy focus from a restrictive trade regime toward a more open trade regime is expected to {{have a significant impact on}} the volume of external trade, domestic production structure, allocation of resources, and social welfare. ^ Simulations are carried out to assess the effects of three major policy reforms: (1) a devaluation of the Sri Lanka rupee, (2) a partial or a complete elimination of export duties, and (3) a devaluation-cum-removal of export duties. ^ Simulation results indicate that the macroeconomic impact of a devaluation-cum-removal of export duties can be substantial. They also suggest that the resource-pull effects of a devaluation and a devaluation-cum-export duty removal policy are significant. However, the model shows that a devaluation combined with an export <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> is likely to be a superior strategy. ...|$|E

The heat duty to regenerate 5 M MEA without catalyst was taken as 100 % and as the base line. The {{results showed that the}} amine regeneration performance in terms of lowest heat duty followed the order: MEA–DEAB with HZSM- 5 (38 %) > MEA–DEAB with γ-Al 2 O 3 (40 %) > MEA–DEAB with no catalyst (51 %) > MEA with HZSM- 5 (65 %) > MEA with γ-Al 2 O 3 (73 %) > MEA– MDEA with γ-Al 2 O 3 /no catalyst (74 %), all relative to MEA with no catalyst (100 %). The results further showed that the addition of MDEA or DEAB (as tertiary amines) in a blended solvent provided R 3 N and HCO −, which split and thus decreased the free energy gaps in the solvent regeneration pathway. The implication is that the use of blended amines in conjunction with solid acid catalysts could result in stripper size and heat <b>duty</b> <b>reductions</b> during solvent regeneration...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the basic}} law of supply and demand, {{as the cost of}} energy input rises, ceteris paribus, {{producer}} prefers to employ smaller quantity of energy input and substitute cheaper inputs for more expensive energy during the production process (Schurr, 1982; Jorgenson, 1984). Hence, the question arises whether determinants of profitability of firms differ based on different types of energy consumption. In analyzing this phenomenon for Indian manufacturing industries, this study tries to find out the determinants of profitability of firms based on three energy clusters (natural gas, petroleum and coal) of Indian manufacturing industries. This study uses data from the PROWESS database provided by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy from 2000 - 2008. The finding of the study suggests that capital intensity, age of the firm and MNE affiliation of firms are the common determinants of profitability for different energy clusters in Indian manufacturing industries. However, the determinants of profitability differ for variables such as energy intensity, size of firm and R&D intensity and based on the choice of primary source of energy consumption. In the debate of CDM, climate change; shifting from traditional fuel sources to recent fuel source might help in reducing CO 2 emissions, specifically for developing country such as India. Fiscal policies support to industries such as value-added tax exemption for new energy conservation products, import <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> and exemption for energy conservation technology might help Indian manufacturing industries to increase the profitability as well as energy efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the long}} {{relationship}} between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries aimed at encouraging their exports while stimulating growth and investment, the ACP states still face difficulties in integrating into the world economy. This paper examines the non-least developed ACP countries preferential trade with the EU using data on EU member states' imports eligible for preferences under the Cotonou agreement for the period 2001 at the 8 -digit level. Using data on tariffs and preferential quota applicable on each 8 -digit product for the year 2001 ad-valorem tariff rates were calculated. The paper also investigates {{the existence of a}} threshold in the offered <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> under which traders have no incentives to ask for preferences since the costs of obtaining these exceeds their benefits. Our results showed that the higher the value of preferences offered, the higher the probability that preferences are requested. Using endogenous threshold estimation techniques we also provided evidence that there exists a minimum value of preferences needed for traders to request preferences. More specifically, if the difference between preferential and third country tariff rates are lower than 4 per cent, there are no incentives for traders to request preferences since the costs of obtaining the preferences are expected to be higher than the benefits from obtaining the preferences. Our results additionally indicate that country specificities also {{play an important role in}} the decision whether requesting preferences or not and how much to import.

Specific savings for each AIMD, rating, total projected savings, and an Excel decision support tool are provided to aid the sponsor with decisions about which ratings, groups of ratings, or while UICs to Civ-Sub. A summary of potential sea shore rotation impacts is also included. The analysis revealed a potential personnel cost savings of 14. 27 %.

40|$|Corruption is a universal, {{multifaceted}} and multifarious {{phenomenon that}} has numerous factors to its name. Effects of corruption, even if {{at a similar}} level in particular countries, differ as well. The causes, however, are always the same: the existence of rare goods - including quasi-public ones - distributed outside the market, and people responsible for the distribution. Corruption can be analyzed as an economic phenomenon (within {{the context of the}} economic theory of human behaviour, theory of games, institutionalism, theory of property rights and transaction costs) of the supply-demand-, costs- and property relations. As a sociological phenomenon it provides a context for exchange processes (naturalization, familiarization of social relations within a noninstitutionalized system of interest expression and vis-a-vis social anomy). As a psychologic-cultural phenomenon, corruption creates a specific atmosphere of establishing contacts, it confers peculiar features and defines the effects of such phenomena in the system. With the additional element of the gift institution, corruption within Polish medical care is yet another issue. In Poland corruption can be analyzed in subject-relational and object aspects (eg penetration of goods such as concessions, information, custom <b>duties,</b> <b>reductions,</b> certificates, norms). The said analyses allow to formulate the chief thesis of the paper, namely, that corruption has a positive impact (eg as an element of competitiveness, pluralization, acceleration of deal making, limiting the distance). However, the negative impact prevails: in this paper defined as a loss of economical and social alternative inherent in economic growth, pathology of institutions, then human attitudes towards the economy and the state which are pertinent {{to the development of the}} market and the civic society. Yet, this is a process - though long - one can fight, even if it involves a number of tools, starting with those of legal and economic nature.

40|$|Peculiarities of {{development}} and signs of emotional burnout syndrome among teaching staff of theoretical departments at Higher State Educational Establishment of Ukraine “Bukovinian State Medical University” have been examined. To diagnose the degree of emotional burnout adapted V. V. Boyko’s method was applied according to which not only signs of emotional burnout, degree of formation and stages {{of development}} of emotional burnout syndrome can be detected, but availability of psychosomatic and psycho-vegetative disorders as well. Formation of emotional burnout syndrome among educators is considered to have three stages: exertion, resistance and exhaustion. Exertion stage is predominantly characterized by excessive worries caused by psychological traumatic experience, anxiety and depression. Resistance stage is manifested by emotional thriftiness and emotional-moral disorientation. Exhaustion stage is characterized by emotional deficiency, psychosomatic and psycho-vegetative disorders. Two teachers {{in the study were}} found to develop two stages of emotional burnout – exertion and resistance. Their main symptoms are sensations of being cornered which is indicative of the development of intellectual-emotional block condition, desire to finish working day quickly, feelings of anxiety and depression with simultaneous formation of professional <b>duty</b> <b>reduction</b> symptom. Resistance stage was found in six teachers with its dominating signs like reduction of professional duties, low interest to work and deterioration of professional activity. Resistance and exhaustion stages were found in four teachers. Their most pronounced symptoms were wider emotional thriftiness, which is indicative of a limited communication with the audience, decreased interest in work and emotional deficiency, when people lose their professional abilities changing positive emotions into negative ones, become rude in communication. Four teachers, women mostly, were found to develop all the three stages of emotional burnout syndrome. Their dominating signs were worries concerning psychological traumatic circumstances characterized by intensified irritation and lack of confidence to people, accumulated dissatisfaction of the situation. At the same time, the most pronounced sign was wide emotional thriftiness which is indicative of lack of desire to communicate with the audience and decreased interest in work. It was proved that the signs of emotional burnout syndrome were not found among teachers depending on an educational subject, although emotional burnout develops more frequently while working with English-speaking students...|$|E

40|$|Most {{solution}} {{methods for}} the {{vehicle routing problem}} with time windows (VRPTW) develop routes from the earliest feasible departure time. However, in practice, temporal traffic congestions make that such solutions are not optimal with respect to minimizing the total duty time. Furthermore, VRPTW solutions do not account for complex driving hours regulations, which severely restrict the daily travel time available for a truck driver. To deal with these problems, we consider the vehicle departure time optimization (VDO) problem as a post-processing step of solving a VRPTW. We propose an ILP-formulation that minimizes the total duty time. The obtained solutions are feasible with respect to driving hours regulations and they account for temporal traffic congestions by modeling time-dependent travel times. For the latter, we assume a piecewise constant speed function. Computational experiments show that problem instances of realistic sizes can be solved to optimality within practical computation times. Furthermore, <b>duty</b> time <b>reductions</b> of 8 percent can be achieved. Finally, {{the results show that}} ignoring time-dependent travel times and driving hours regulations during the development of vehicle routes leads to many infeasible vehicle routes. Therefore, vehicle routing methods should account for these real-life restrictions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{providing}} network coverage using wireless sensors that operate on low duty cycles (measured by the percentage time a sensor is on or active), i. e., each sensor alternates between active and sleep states to conserve energy with an average sleep period (much) longer than the active period. The dynamic change in topology {{as a result of}} such duty-cycling has potentially disruptive effect on the operation and performance of the network. This is compensated by adding redundancy in the sensor deployment. In this paper we examine the fundamental relationship between the <b>reduction</b> in sensor <b>duty</b> cycle and the required level of redundancy for a fixed performance measure, and explore the design of good sensor sleep schedules. In particular, we consider two types of mechanisms, the random sleep type where each sensor keeps an active-sleep schedule independent of another, and the coordinated sleep type where sensors coordinate with each other in reaching an active-sleep schedule. Both types are studied within the context of providing network coverage. We present specific scheduling algorithms within each type, and illustrate their coverage and duty cycle properties via both analysis and simulation. We show with either type of sleep schedule the benefit of added redundancy saturates at some point in that the <b>reduction</b> in <b>duty</b> cycles starts to diminish beyond a certain threshold in deployment redundancy. We also show that at the expense of extra control overhead, a coordinated sleep schedule is more robust and can achieve higher <b>duty</b> cycle <b>reduction</b> with the same amount of redundancy compared to a random sleep schedule...|$|R

Screening models for anti-predatory behaviour, Herfindahl-Hireshmann Index (HHI) for concentration and descriptive statistical measures used to testify the Anti dumping (AD) behaviour, determinants and spread impact. The results are consistent with the earlier literature that AD <b>duties</b> create trade <b>reduction</b> and diversion. It is evident from the results in half of the cases studied that an economic rationale has been followed in the application of AD (Anti-dumping) duties in Pakistan. Although the number of AD cases is limited, Pakistan has {{emerged as one of the}} intensive users of AD, relative to its total import share. It is also evident from the fact that intensive use of AD reduces trade and increases trade barriers, similarly, trade diversion reduces the chances of trade reduction. The key message emerging from this research is that trade diversion persists and in some cases trade diversion is substantial and it offsets the effect of AD measures on named countries to the benefit of non-named countries. ...|$|R

According to the Department of Defense's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), privatizing base support functions could free money {{at a time when the}} services will need to begin funding major Research and Development (R&D) projects for new and modem equipment for the services. By hiring civilian companies to perform ordinary <b>duties,</b> a cost <b>reduction</b> of one-third of the total budget for base functions is estimated. The JCS estimates private companies could run military bases for twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent less than it costs the military. N...|$|R
40|$|From whole globe {{the demand}} {{of oil and}} gas is {{increasing}} so increase production is most important. To increase oil production from existing wells in an oil field we have to focus much on optimizing oil production. One way to optimize oil production is to find an alternative to existing intermittent gas lift technology. As we study big oil field currently with huge oil and gas operating companies, the gas injection line network is very old and new intermittent gas lift installations on new wells has been connected to the existing network. Now this creates gas starving for the new installations and resulting in inadequate amount of gas production from the well. By introducing Plunger lift technology of artificial gas lift along with existing intermittent gas lift can provide a fool proof solution to the problem and also reduction in injected gas requirement also. Thus, reducing the compressor <b>duty</b> and overall <b>reduction</b> in environmental emission of harmful gases by reducing the diesel engine load required previously for compression. This paper discusses in detail with proof in form of tables, increase in oil production and reduction in injection gas requirement and reduction in emission of harmful gases to the environment...|$|R
