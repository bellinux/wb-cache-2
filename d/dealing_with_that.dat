5000|$|Papadakis's first {{experience}} of broadcasting occurred {{when he was}} a tailback for the USC football team, where he became a popular interviewee among media in Los Angeles. When questioned about his popularity, Papadakis replied, [...] "I just feel like the media is starved for somebody to say something different than, 'We really have to play hard this week.' That’s all good stuff, but I <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> in meetings every day. I <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> for six hours with coaches." ...|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{inhabitants}} of Ziph betray David's location to Saul, but David hears about it and flees with his men to Maon. Saul follows David, but is forced to break off pursuit when the Philistines invade. After <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> threat Saul tracks David to the caves at Engedi. As he searches the cave David manages to cut {{off a piece of}} Saul's robe without being discovered, yet David restrains his men from harming the king. David then leaves the cave, revealing himself to Saul, and gives a speech that persuades Saul to reconcile.|$|E
500|$|... "Before {{all this}} came about {{we had our}} own method of dealing with law-breakers and in {{settling}} disputes between members. That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't {{know how to handle}} murderers {{and they were going to}} show us." ...|$|E
500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It never occurred to me before how that would have an effect on his character [...] to be <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E

25|$|The Bollée-inspired {{design was}} supplanted by a licence-built Belgian Vivinus voiturette at Niederbronn and a Marseilles-designed Turcat-Méry at Lunéville, {{following}} a 1901 <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> cash-strapped company.|$|R
500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to look at one another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
2500|$|FIRST LEGO League Jr. is a {{variation}} of the FIRST LEGO League, aimed towards elementary school children, in which kids ages 5 to 8 build LEGO models <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> year's FLL challenge. At least one part of a model has a moving component. [...] The teams participate in exhibitions around the country, where they demonstrate and explain their models and research for award opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|If one and {{the same}} man is {{responsible}} for the five murders that have been committed in this vicinity since March 24, the Gazette feels that the public should know the type of man with which the community is <b>dealing.</b> <b>With</b> <b>that</b> thought in mind, the newspaper asked Dr. Lapalla for the following interview. This interview was sought and was given only {{in the interest of the}} public and the intent is not to alarm unduly anyone, but to give everyone the benefit of what is considered an expert opinion as to the mental behavior of the man sought in these crimes.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's {{a lot of}} {{talk about}} negotiating distance from people in your life. We were <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> in various forms, learning what it means to be alone, learning what it means to be close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Not much media {{attention}} {{was given to}} the general election race due to the district's heavily Democratic lean. The San Gabriel Valley Tribune dubbed the race [...] "The Chu Chu train" [...] in reference to the same last names of the two major candidates, while a campaign consultant referred to it as [...] "The Chu-Chu runoff". With expected turnout at the 10 percent level, one analyst dismissed the possible name confusion effect on voters: [...] "When you’re <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> low of turnout, you’re dealing with a sophisticated, knowledgeable electorate." [...] Despite their relation by marriage, the two women did not know each other well nor like each other. Judy May Chu accused Betty Tom Chu of dropping her middle name [...] "Tom" [...] in order to play further upon the name similarity, a charge that Betty Chu sternly denied.|$|E
2500|$|Savory {{developed}} a flexible management {{system designed to}} improve grazing systems. Holistic planned grazing {{is one of a}} number of newer grazing management systems that more closely simulate the behavior of natural herds of wildlife and have been shown to improve riparian habitats and water quality over systems that often led to land degradation, and be an effective tool to improve range condition for both livestock and wildlife. Holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but differs in that it more explicitly recognizes and provides a framework for adapting to the four basic ecosystem processes: the water cycle, the mineral cycle including the carbon cycle, energy flow, and community dynamics (the relationship between organisms in an ecosystem) as equal in importance to livestock production and social welfare. Thus the holistic context in the planning stage leads to different decisions in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> complexity. Holistic management has been likened to [...] "a permaculture approach to rangeland management".|$|E

50|$|One {{factor was}} the large backlog of {{documents}} {{scheduled to be}} automatically declassified on December 31, 2009 and how to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> reality. Another factor was delivering on a campaign promise.|$|R
6000|$|... "We can {{scarcely}} do your uncle the injustice," [...] Hamel remarked, [...] "of imagining {{that he can}} possibly have any reason or any desire to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> man except as a guest." ...|$|R
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> pain".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Peterson's {{theme is}} most {{commonly}} performed on a solo electric guitar—McCreary felt that [...] "the {{image of a}} single guitar player trying to hold his own against a 90-piece orchestra is a nice metaphor for how Mike must feel"—which is [...] "consumed by distorted synthesizers and low brass" [...] whenever the darker or more unstable sides of the character's superpowers are shown. McCreary also introduced a theme for the mysterious Centipede group in the pilot. [...] "To imply the centipede-nature of the theme," [...] McCreary [...] "used ten notes, {{divided into two groups}} of 5. Played on delicate bells and de-tuned piano, the percussive nature of the notes evokes two rows of tiny insect feet crawling across a string." [...] This theme also comes to represent the group's leader, the Clairvoyant. The emotional bond between the central characters is represented by [...] "The Agents" [...] theme, a much more intimate and accessible idea than the main theme. McCreary described the theme as unfolding [...] "essentially like a pop-song, with a simple A-B-A-A structure". The Skye theme is most clearly heard in emotional moments <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> character's backstory, but also appears in many other variations, including brief, romantic statements to highlight her early relationship with Grant Ward. Fitz and Simmons' theme is [...] " [...] less melodic than the other themes, and more motivic. It’s essentially an ostinato that rolls over itself again and again, evolving into subtly different variations with each turn through the pattern. This musically emulates their speaking pattern, where they are constantly stumbling over one another and saying the same thing in slightly different ways." [...] "The Hub" [...] introduces the audience (and Skye) to [...] "Big S.H.I.E.L.D.", as opposed to Coulson's small team, which McCreary gave its own, more militaristic theme. The theme for John Garrett has two parts, an ostinato and a melody, and [...] "represents his adventurous personality, designed to be fun, bouncy and as far away from ominous as possible".|$|E
6000|$|The Democratic {{policy in}} regard to that {{institution}} will not tolerate the merest breath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong about it. Try it by some of Judge Douglas's arguments. He says he [...] "don't care whether it is voted up or voted down in the Territories." [...] I do not care myself in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> expression whether {{it is intended to}} be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject or only of the national policy he desires to have established.|$|E
50|$|Admir Ljevaković (born 7 August 1984 in Tešanj) is a Bosnian footballer. He {{currently}} {{plays for}} FK Teplice in the Czech Gambrinus liga. He signed a three-year <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> club in August 2007.|$|R
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Alexandre Desplat. In {{a film about}} a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy: [...] "This is a film about {{the sound of the}} voice. Music has to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Music has to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> silence. Music has to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> time." ...|$|R
5000|$|... it is secret {{meaning it}} is not, {{as a whole}} or in the way its parts are arranged, known by or readily {{accessible}} {{to people in the}} field <b>that</b> would normally <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> information ...|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} assassins were captured, and Joan of Beaufort was {{resolved}} that their death {{should be as}} atrocious as their crime, it was Malcolm who strove to bend her to forgiveness. He bade her recollect King Henry, and how, when <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> cruel monster, the Castellane of Meaux, he had merely required death, without enhancing the agony; but Joan, in her rage and misery, had left the Englishwoman behind her, and was implacable. All that human cruelty could invent {{was to be the}} lot of Robert Graham and his associates; and whereas they had granted no priest to their victim, none should be granted to them.|$|E
60|$|While in Peru, he {{met with}} a Spanish lady, who asked if he knew {{a friend of hers}} who came from Genoa, and then {{proceeded}} to inquire which was the largest city, Genoa or Italy, and if Europe was not a little on this side of Spain, while a priest asked if London was a part of France. After spending a little time in distributing Bibles in Peru, he made his way home by the way of Panama, and on his arrival made an attempt to interest the Moravians in the cause so near his heart, thinking that what they had done in Greenland proved their power of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> savage apathy that springs from inclemency of climate, but the mission was by them pronounced impracticable.|$|E
60|$|I {{was pleased}} at this {{opportunity}} of rescuing this story from a far-back {{number of the}} English Review, in which it first appeared, and putting it in a book. It may be a shock to the reader to be brought down from {{a story of a}} great king and queen of England in the tenth century to the obscure annals of a yokel and his wife who lived in a Wiltshire village only a century ago; or even less, since my poor yokel was hanged for sheep-stealing in 1821. But it is, I think, worth preserving, since it is the only narrative I know of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> rare and curious subject, the survival of tree-worship in our own country. That, however, was not the reason of my being pleased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take my counsel, Altamont," [...] Strong said, gravely, [...] "and mind how you <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> man. Don't make it {{too much}} his {{interest}} {{to get rid of}} you; or who knows what he may do?" ...|$|R
