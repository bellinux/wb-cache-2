Mandodari bears Ravana three sons: Meghanada, Atikaya, and Akshayakumara. Mandore, a town located 9 km north of Jodhpur, is {{believed}} to be the native place of Mandodari. Ravana is treated as a son-in-law among some local Brahmins and has a temple dedicated to <b>him</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought <b>him</b> <b>here.</b> Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|J.R.R. Tolkien found {{inspiration}} in the Malvern landscape {{which he had}} viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary's home near Evesham. He {{was introduced to the}} area by C. S. Lewis, who had brought <b>him</b> <b>here</b> to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit & The Fellowship of the Rings, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.|$|E

But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for <b>him</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{spent his}} final years {{composing}} his memoirs (Gedanken und Erinnerungen, or Thoughts and Memories), a work lauded by historians.

25|$|The {{creature}} is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces {{that they must}} fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck ("On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast"). The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join <b>him</b> <b>here),</b> and Giovanni di Buiamonte.

25|$|The last {{missing in}} {{this list of}} saints is St. John Sarkander (Czech Jan Sarkander), whose statue (holding a lily {{as a symbol of}} purity) is on the second stage. John Sarkander was a priest who was {{tortured}} to death in Olomouc prison {{in the beginning of the}} Thirty Years' War, because he, as the legend says, refused to break the seal of confession. The decision to place <b>him</b> <b>here</b> violated the tradition, since Sarkander had not been canonized and not even beatified in that time yet, which could have resulted in problems with the Holy See. However, his following was so strong here that the craftsmen decided to take the risk. Sarkander was beatified in 1859 and canonized in 1995 on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II in Olomouc.|$|E

500|$|During the 1933 track season, Ward was so {{dominant}} that he {{was dubbed}} Michigan's “one-man track team” and became a national sensation. [...] He led Michigan to Big Ten championships in both indoor and outdoor track. Going into the Big Ten track meet in May 1933, Ward was expected to dominate. Coach Hoyt described Ward as “a good ‘un,” and praised him for his unassuming character and tolerance of the spotlight of publicity. [...] One report noted: “He is altogether likeable, for he always speaks without raising his voice and never protests a decision. [...] … Ward is a star now, but he is just finishing his first year of competition.

This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue. The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes. Wareing said of the issue at the time, [...] "I'm delighted to get the fifth rosette, it's a great achievement.

500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident {{in the moment of}} the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with <b>him.</b> <b>Here,</b> verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E

500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin.

On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?"

He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E
500|$|Attitudes {{towards the}} suffragette {{movement}} as a whole were badly affected by militant actions led mostly {{by members of the}} WSPU. In July 1908 the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League (WNASL) [...] was inaugurated, with Welsh MP Ivor Guest severing as treasurer. The initial involvement of Ermine Taylor led to a branch of the WNASL being formed in Denbigshire the following year. Undeterred the pro-suffrage groups continued to take direct action. In Bristol in 1908, Winston Churchill had been threatened by WSPU members, and the widespread anger after the event led to a Cardiff meeting led by Charlotte Despard being abandoned. In Merthyr the speakers were drowned out and herrings and tomatoes thrown at them. Despite being a 'favoured son of Wales' and outwardly pro-women's suffrage, Liberal MP, and from 1908, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George was often a target of suffragette activity. Although Lloyd George always stated his support to the suffrage movement in public speeches, the failure of the Liberal Government to make any progress on implementing change led Christabel Pankhurst to believe him to be a secret anti-suffragist. Pankhurst was quoted in the Times in November 1911 declaring [...] "'Lloyd Georgitis' seemed to be a disease which afflicted men to-day with very few exceptions. But women saw through him. They had always known him as an anti-suffragist, and they must fight <b>him</b> <b>here</b> and now." [...] Pankhurst's assumptions had a basis of truth, as a month before Lloyd George had written to the Liberal Party chief whip bemoaning the fact that the forthcoming Conciliation Bill would hand hundreds of thousands of votes to the Tory party.|$|E
