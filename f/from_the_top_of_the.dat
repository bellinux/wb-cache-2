5|$|A {{portion of}} the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is on Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 187 contain the Nescopeck Mountain Barrens. The ridge is on the {{northern}} border of the 3550-acre Nescopeck State Park. Historically, there were trails {{leading up to the}} top of Nescopeck Mountain. There is high visibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge and the town of Bloomsburg can be seen.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting {{positions on the}} hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo. The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.|$|E
5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} fell apart. A roster filled with mostly older {{veterans}} plus some bad personnel moves (e.g. the dispatching of Rosey Grier, Sam Huff, and Don Chandler) {{lead to a}} quick exit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standings. The Giants finished 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought.|$|E

5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies {{between the two}} antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in {{the centre of the}} labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|It was, at first, {{merely a}} folly. It {{was used as}} a summer-house, and seven {{counties}} could be seen, as now, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby {{at the behest of the}} Duke.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E

5|$|The Regiment {{followed}} the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They {{hid in the}} San Carlos Convent, in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe. San Martín watched the enemy ships <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Martín employed a pincer movement to trap the royalists. He led one column and Justo Bermúdez the other.|$|E
5|$|The caps form <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short stipe by {{the growth}} and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface. Spines start to form when the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Mary Rose began in 1510 in Portsmouth and she was launched in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with rigging and decking, and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm the Mary Rose, she was also equipped with flags, banners and streamers (extremely elongated flags that were flown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masts) that were either painted or gilded.|$|E

5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a snood, that hang <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|With {{construction}} finally proceeding once more, the Palace Hotel {{closed in}} June 1986.

5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, fell to his death <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. He skied {{as fast as he could}} to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosas range {{spans the}} entire eastern {{coastline}} of Australia, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to {{the vicinity of}} Bega on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland and the far western plains in New South Wales. F.rubiginosa f. rubiginosa and F.rubiginosa f. glabrescens are found {{over most of the}} range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.|$|E

5|$|Gifu's {{most famous}} castle is Gifu Castle, located on Mount Kinka. First {{built by the}} Nikaidō clan during the Kamakura period, the castle has gone through many forms, with its current version rebuilt in 1956. One of its first {{residents}} was Saitō Dōsan, {{who lived in the}} castle when it was still called Inabayama Castle. The next resident, Oda Nobunaga, changed the castle's name {{at the same time that}} he changed the name of the surrounding town. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, visitors have a 360-degree view, effectively giving them a view to all of the city's borders. Inside the castle are many artifacts from its past.|$|E
5|$|Hartshead Pike is a stone tower {{on top of}} Hartshead Hill {{overlooking}} Ashton and Oldham. The current {{building was}} constructed in 1863 {{although there has been}} a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike may have been the site of a beacon in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill it is possible to see the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, the Welsh hills, and the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E
