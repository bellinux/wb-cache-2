5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in <b>general,</b> <b>steel</b> moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E

In the early 1950s Pullman developed a [...] "full-length" [...] design, with the dome seating area stretching {{the length of the}} car. This design posed several challenges. The full-length glass roof (...) necessitated a new, powerful air-conditioning system from a dedicated diesel motor. The massive weight of the car, , required reinforced three-axle trucks from <b>General</b> <b>Steel</b> Castings. Much of this weight was concentrated in the glass dome, which meant new framing techniques to support the second level above the first. The result was an -long dome level which could seat 68, nearly three times that of the Vista Dome. The lounge area beneath seated 28 in booths.|$|E

Studies on air contamination risk analysis is required as a result of factory smoke surrounding air quality monitoring efforts and the health of workers and communities around the plant. There are 4 steps in determining the risk analysis i. e hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment and risk characteristics. There are 4 locations used for the sampling location. All the calculated Pb concentration is far below the quality standard in accordance Central Java Governor Decree No. 8 In 2001 the Pb = 2 μg/m 3.

40|$|T 91 grade steels {{showed a}} gradual {{enhancement}} in tensile ductility {{at ambient temperature}} due {{to an increase in}} Si content from 0. 5 to 2. 0 weight percent (wt. %). However, the ultimate tensile strength was reduced only above 1. 5 wt. % Si. The corrosion potential became more active in an acidic solution with increasing temperature. The cracking susceptibility in a similar environment under a slow-strain-rate (SSR) condition was enhanced at higher temperatures showing reduced ductility, time to failure, and true failure stress. Cathodic potentials applied to the test specimens in SSR testing caused an enhanced cracking tendency at 30 and 60 °C, suggesting hydrogen embrittlement as a possible mechanism of failure. Cracking of precracked and wedge-loaded double-cantilever-beam specimens was enhanced at higher initial stress intensity factors. In <b>general,</b> <b>steels</b> with 2. 0 wt. % Si showed inferior corrosion resistance.
