The elongated body of {{the spacecraft}} had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation</b> from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body {{ends up in the}} spin state that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis).

We propose a numerical model based on the discrete element method which makes possible, thanks to the definition of an appropriate contact law, to simulate the mechanisms of <b>energy</b> <b>dissipations</b> by friction and shocks during the propagation of an avalanche of granular material on a slope. The parameters of the contact model are obtained from laboratory experiments of single impacts. A particular attention was paid to the values of the run-out, the morphology of the deposit, the proportions of <b>energy</b> <b>dissipations</b> by impacts or friction, and the kinetic energies of translation and rotation. The results of this numerical study provide valuable information on the relevance of some usual assumptions of granular flow continuous models...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{electronic}} state and the mechanism of <b>energy</b> <b>dissipations</b> by {{the motion of the}} vortex core in the quantum limit, we measured the microwave complex conductivity of pure FeSe single crystals in the zero-field limit and under finite magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density changed as 1 -(T/T_ c) ^ 1. 2, indicating the presence of nodal lines in the superconducting gap. From the magnetic-field dependence of the flux-flow resistivity, we found that a barometer of the electronic state inside the vortex core turned out to be ω_ 0 τ_ core= 1 ± 0. 5. This suggests that the vortex core of pure FeSe is still in the moderately clean regime, which is inconsistent with the expectation that the super-clean core is realized in this material. We also found that the mean-free path inside the vortex core is suppressed at the distance of the order of the core radius. Based on the observed results and previous reports, we discussed possible origins of rather small ω_ 0 τ_ core in terms of the multiple-bands nature and additional mechanisms giving extra <b>energy</b> <b>dissipations</b> specific to the vortex core in motion.

25|$|The {{situation}} {{is different in}} a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of phonons. Due to quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE {{is larger than the}} thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation.</b>|$|E

The established closure model is applied to analyses of a gravity-driven stationary avalanche with incompressible grains down an incline.

25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation</b> in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

[...] On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, {{in the area of the}} Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation</b> caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water.

500|$|Unlike Earth and the Moon, Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from tidal dissipation rather than radioactive isotope decay, the result of Io's orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede. Such heating is dependent on Io's distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The resonant orbit also helps to maintain Io's distance from Jupiter; otherwise tides raised on Jupiter would cause Io to slowly spiral outward from its parent planet. The vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge, between the times Io is at periapsis and apoapsis in its orbit, could {{be as much as}} [...] The friction or tidal dissipation produced in Io's interior due to this varying tidal pull, which, without the resonant orbit, would have gone into circularizing Io's orbit instead, creates significant tidal heating within Io's interior, melting a significant amount of Io's mantle and core. The amount of energy produced is up to 200 times greater than that produced solely from radioactive decay. This heat is released in the form of volcanic activity, generating its observed high heat flow (global total: 0.6 to 1.6×1014W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time; however, the current amount of tidal dissipation is consistent with the observed heat flow. Models of tidal heating and convection have not found consistent planetary viscosity profiles that simultaneously match tidal <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation</b> and mantle convection of heat to the surface.|$|E
