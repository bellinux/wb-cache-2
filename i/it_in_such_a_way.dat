5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

The tone of the bell will continue to resonate, decaying naturally until it stops completely or the ringer stops it by damping the bell with a hand or on the body or a padded surface.|$|E

Finally having had enough, the townsfolk took all of their spoiled food and placed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that the carabao would not miss it. Sure enough, the carabao ate it, but his stomach couldn't handle the spoiled food, so he defecated, leaving behind him a mound of feces, until he had emptied his stomach of the food. The feces then dried, forming the Chocolate Hills.|$|E

25|$|The Duplex or Reversible machine derives {{its name}} {{from the fact that it}} prints both sides of the cloth. It {{consists}} really of two ordinary machines so combined that when the cloth passes, fully printed on one side from the first, its plain side is exposed to the rollers of the second, which print an exact duplicate of the first impression upon <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that both printings coincide. A pin pushed through the face of the cloth ought to protrude through the corresponding part of the design printed on the back if the two patterns are in good fit.|$|E
25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, Werfel left the {{frontline}} for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them Robert Musil, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Franz Blei. Through the latter, Werfel met {{and fell in love}} with Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, the former lover of the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the wife of the architect Walter Gropius, then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel’s poems to music, reciprocated despite Werfel being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, found initially distasteful. Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, Manon, Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years. However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel’s career and influenced <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that he became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.|$|E

500|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} as the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to Frankie Knuckles. While the award was under this name, it was presented without specifying a work; when it shifted {{to its current}} name in 2002 works were named. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented [...] "to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds or alters <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as {{to create a new}} and unique performance".

500|$|Although {{both the}} season four episode [...] "Paper Hearts" [...] and the season five episode [...] "Redux II" [...] {{had dealt with}} {{possible}} explanations for Samantha Mulder's fate, the issue {{had yet to be}} resolved when the series moved into its seventh season. Realizing that the season potentially could be the last, series creator Chris Carter decided to conclude the Samantha story-arc. [...] "The expectation was that if this were going to be the final season, that the finale would be about Mulder's sister. We wanted to deal with that sooner rather than later. We wanted to wrap up Mulder's emotion story with his sister and do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that would emphasize [...] dramatic abilities." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a role reversal with Dana Scully the believer and Fox Mulder the skeptic, which David Duchovny called [...] "a refreshing change of pace." [...] Nutter said that dealing with faith permitted the show's creators to further delve into Scully's character. The episode {{was the first}} to discuss Scully's faith in-depth. Series creator Chris Carter later emphasized that the theme of the episode was more on personal belief rather than organized religion, noting, [...] " [...] deals with faith, not religion with a capital 'R' or Catholicism with a capital 'C'". The producers for the series were cautious about presenting an overtly religious episode of the series for fear of [...] "pissing certain people off", but, according to Carter, the show [...] "handled <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as to make it about miracle belief, or lack of belief." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hot judder {{is usually}} {{produced}} {{as a result}} of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop. It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around [...] to about , which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or hot spots. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that produces a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) comes in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{early in her}} career, Grant stated, [...] "I have a healthy {{sense of right and}} wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh." [...] The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: [...] "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pirates did {{not have}} the luxury of {{building}} their ships; they were [...] "acquired." [...] As a result, a pirate captain had {{to be on the lookout}} for a vessel that would serve his purpose and procure the ship without harming <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as to make it unfit for service. There is consensus among scholars that pirates would use both small vessels like a sloop or a full-rigged pinnace, as well as the larger slave ships (but not as often), and on rare occasions the warship. Along these lines, the naval historian David Cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the North American seabord between 17101730. by the numbers of recorded attacks, with an overwhelming 55% involving sloops, 25% in the larger ships, 10% in brigs and brigantines, 5% in schooners, 3% in open sail-less boats, and 2% in snows.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the owner}} of {{property}} deals with <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as to deny or impede the rights of some other person over that property, the courts will order that owner to hold it on constructive trust. For trusts of real property, constructive trusts may arise {{in one of three}} situations. First, when the parties form an agreement to buy the land, or show [...] "common intention" [...] by jointly contributing to the price or mortgage of a property, as in Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset. Second, when a contract to transfer rights is agreed to, the equitable interest is automatically transferred, something that also applies to personal property. Third, a constructive trust may be created where there are several parties interested in commercially exploiting land, and some refrain from doing so due to an agreement with the defendant, as in Pallant v Morgan. In Banner Homes Group plc v Luff Developments Ltd, it was decided that this principle applies even when no binding contract has been signed, and the claimant has refrained due to ongoing negotiations with the defendant.|$|E
