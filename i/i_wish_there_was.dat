5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly, my boy; {{but why do}} {{you come}} to me? You know that Dr Lawrence has charge of and manages my money. How <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no such thing as money, and no need for it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{strong for}} George. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more like him [...] . Well, {{if you think}} I've butted in on your private affairs sufficiently, I suppose I ought to be moving. We've a {{rehearsal}} this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Alma. [...] "I'm glad there isn't that {{unpleasant}} odor here; but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} more of the chinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You’re a good son, Peter," [...] ses old Isaac, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{more like}} you. I’ll {{come down with}} you, if you like; I’ve got nothing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not very. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a Y. M. C. A. here, so I {{could take}} up regular exercise. I {{used to think}} I could do pretty good acrobatics, if I had a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! losing one's {{hat in the}} Rhine, getting left at a {{dirty little}} inn, and having our pockets picked, are not what I call adventures. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> brigands in Germany--it needs {{something}} of that sort to enliven its stupidity." ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{mention the}} belated Barbeys; {{what about the}} equally belated Pineros? And I hope you will keep your {{bookshop}} alive to supplying me continuously with the Saga Library. I cannot get enough of Sagas; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> nine thousand; talk about realism! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like very}} much to be here," [...] she murmured. [...] "It is so solemn and lonely--after my great happiness--with nothing but the sky above my face. It seems as if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no folk {{in the world but}} we two; and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not--except 'Liza-Lu." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pony's {{mother was}} silent for a moment as if she could not answer, and then she said, [...] "Well, all I know is, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no such boy in this town as Jim Leonard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{shouted the}} doctor, in disgust, [...] "Mrs. Bentley is {{as well as}} ever. It's Miss Bentley. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a thousandth part of the chance for her that there is for her mother." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Countesses and ladies," [...] {{said the}} mistress. [...] "There are, in Provence and the South, what <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> here in Flanders,--Courts of Love, at which all {{offenders}} against the sacred laws of Venus and Cupid are tried by an assembly of their peers, and punished {{according to their}} deserts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good or bad, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{fewer of}} them, {{and that they}} were farther off. This man Peter is a mystery to me: {{sometimes}} he seems quite friendly; then, ag'in, he appears just ready to take all our scalps. Do you know much of his past history, Mr. Amen?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ay! there's no {{help for}} it, I suppose,' said Steerforth. 'I have almost {{forgotten}} {{that there is}} anything {{to do in the}} world but to go out tossing on the sea here. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duane, a {{word with}} you," [...] he said. [...] "I believe you're not so black as you've been painted. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> time to say more. Tell me this, anyway. Do you know the Ranger Captain MacNelly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{sure there}} is no other person in all the wide world that I could have thought good enough for you. Agnes! Agnes! O, Edmund, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any way of not being quite choked with gladness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Clarence,' said my father, 'your {{mother did}} not mean {{anything}} but that you and Edward are the comfort of our lives. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a chance of Griffith redeeming the past as you have done; but I see no hope of that. A man is never ruined till he is married.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} it was a dose," [...] Bartley admitted. The money had set several things in a better light. [...] "If all the people that have abused me would take it back as handsomely as your father has,"--he held the check up,--"why, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> twice as many of them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You can {{do better}} if you try; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> time to train you. We'll do the 'logs duet' once more after this tomfoolery. Ha! Captain Armytage. You are an awful pirate, and no mistake. Where {{did you get that}} splendid horse-pistol?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, would you--WOULD you? Oh, {{how good}} you always are, Pen! And you always say what you think. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some one coming to see you too. That's all that I don't like about it. Perhaps----He was telling about his friend there in Texas----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scold me, dear," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, her {{delicate}} worn face flushing with delight. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something you could}} eat after your ride--instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa make you a cup of chocolate in your old way. You used to like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is such a}} joy to {{hear that}} you enjoy {{anything}} of mine, and a double joy to have your sympathy in my love of those Italians.

I am afraid you do sometimes meet with what may be trying,' he added, no doubt remembering Lady Price's tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Waters is a {{very good}} man," [...] said Mrs. Bowen, with the air of not meaning to approve him quite, nor yet to let any notion of his be made fun of in her presence. [...] "But for my part <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{not going to be any}} Carnival; the city will be in such an uproar for the next two weeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{no sign of}} consciousness, {{no trace}} of confusion, the major {{carefully}} turned over his pile, and replied in the most natural manner, [...] "Not a trace of it; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> for nothing annoys me more than any delay or mistake about my letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is a {{difficult}} question, dearest. There {{is no doubt that}} this way is a very bad one. A great many people think so. I do myself. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not a slave in the land. But then, I don't know {{what is to be done}} about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothing very {{surprising}} {{in the matter}} that I can see," [...] said Caleb Garth.

6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} Pitt," [...] said his lordship. [...] "He's a dashed good fellow, Pitt. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more like him. And he wasn't {{pinching}} the stuff, either. If you had only listened {{when he tried}} to tell you, you mightn't be in such a frightful hole. He was putting the things back, as he said. I know all about it. Well, what's the answer?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'O, I don't mean that. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no {{different}} {{ranks in the}} world, and that contrivance were not a necessary faculty to have at all. Well, {{we are going to}} cross by the little steamer that puts in here, and we are going on Monday.' She added in another minute, 'What had Mr. Julian to tell us that he came here? How did he find us out?' ...|$|R
