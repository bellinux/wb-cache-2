25|$|John Winchester {{gives it}} to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At {{the end of the}} second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the key to open one of the Gates to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's {{right-hand}} demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are <b>five</b> <b>things</b> in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.|$|E

500|$|As films {{featuring}} prurient elements {{performed well}} at the box office, after the crackdown on crime films, Hollywood increased its production of pictures featuring the seven deadly sins. In 1932, Warner Bros formed an official policy decreeing that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something {{having to do with}} ginger." [...] Filmmakers (including the shrewd Mae West) began putting in overly suggestive material they knew would never reach theaters in hopes that lesser offenses would survive the cutting-room floor. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them <b>five</b> <b>things</b> to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would get away with murder with what they left in." ...|$|E
500|$|Clair {{is portrayed}} by American actress Phylicia Rashad. In {{addition}} to appearing in minor roles on both television and Broadway, Rashad had a recurring role as Courtney Wright on {{the soap opera}} One Life to Live before Cosby personally selected her to play his character's wife. Several actresses auditioned for the role, the majority of whom tended to resort to angrily yelling and moving their heads {{in a manner similar}} to that of a bobblehead doll when scolding the child actors playing the character's children during their auditions. However, Rashad's subtle interpretation was different from those of her competitors; when the actress screen tested opposite actor Malcolm Jamal-Warner, who would ultimately go on to portray son Theo, Rashad simply paused, stared and silently gave him [...] "a look" [...] instead of immediately scolding the character that, according to Cosby, meant [...] "four or <b>five</b> <b>things</b> ... and none of them were good." [...] At the end of Rashad's audition, Cosby announced [...] " [...] Clair" [...] to Carsey. Additionally, because Clair was still intended to be of Dominican heritage at the time, Rashad's own bilingualism and fluency in Spanish benefited her successful casting. Cosby told Rashad that she won the role because she acted [...] "with a knowing look in [...] eye." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known European {{reference to}} the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: [...] "They [...] have a green fruit which they call durian, {{as big as a}} watermelon. Inside there are <b>five</b> <b>things</b> like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours." [...] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian. In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.|$|E

The sapling was planted by Devānāmpiya Tissa in the Mahāmeghavana in Anurdhapura. It seems that [...] "the Buddha, on his death bed, had {{resolved}} <b>five</b> <b>things,</b> one being that the branch which {{should be taken to}} Ceylon should detach itself". The journey route followed by Sangamitta who carried the tree branch was from Gayā to Pātaliputta and then to Tāmalittī [...] in Bengal.

Numbers are abstract, and the addition of a group of three things to a group of <b>five</b> <b>things</b> will yield a group of eight things.

2500|$|During the pre-code period, {{after the}} {{crack down on}} crime films, {{production}} of films featuring prurient elements increased. Studios began putting in extra suggestive material which they knew would never reach theaters. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said that [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them <b>five</b> <b>things</b> to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would {{get away with murder}} with what they left in." [...] In 1932 Warner Brothers' policy was that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something having to do with ginger." [...] Films such as Laughing Sinners, Safe in Hell, The Devil Is Driving, Free Love, Merrily We Go to Hell, Laughter in Hell and The Road to Ruin were provocative in their mere titles. Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by coming up with suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even {{going so far as to}} come up with in house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays. Commonly labeled [...] "sex films" [...] by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality. According to a Variety analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had [...] "some sex slant", with 145 possessing [...] "questionable sequences", and 44 being [...] "critically sexual"." [...] The trade paper summarized that [...] "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was...flavored with bedroom essence." [...] Attempts to create films for adults only (dubbed [...] "pinking") only served to bring larger audiences of all ages to the cineplex.|$|E

50|$|The Persian {{historian}} Al Biruni {{who visited}} {{and lived in}} India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures. These correspond to five Yamas of ancient Hindu ethics: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth, non-falsehood), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). In addition to these <b>five</b> negative <b>things</b> to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends <b>five</b> positive <b>things</b> to strive for as Niyamas: Śauca (purity in body, speech and mind), Santosha (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), Tapas (perseverance, meditation, austerity), Swadhyaya (lifelong learning) and Pranidhan (right attitude, contemplation). An ethical life in Hinduism is essential for a liberated life, one without craving, one that is content, attained through knowledge and by abstaining from evil.|$|R

So then, by these <b>five</b> <b>things</b> we see what {{is the way that}} sinful joy is maintained in the hearts of wicked men; and also by what means the limbs and brats of Antichrist will keep up that joy that at first will be conceived in their hearts at the thought that now they have killed their tormentors. They shall have music. They shall have feasting. They shall have laughter. They shall have fleshly solace. And they shall have their fill, for the time, of revenge.
