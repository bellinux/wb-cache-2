The ventilated facade can operate under mechanical or natural ventilation mode and its thermal control depends on the weather conditions and the energetic demand of the building.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a model of}} galaxy clusters in which the hot intracluster gas is efficiently heated by dynamical friction (DF) of galaxies. We allow for both subsonic and supersonic motions of galaxies and use the gravitational drag formula in a gaseous medium presented by Ostriker (1999). The energy lost by the galaxies is either redistributed locally or into a Gaussian centered on the galaxy. We find that the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and strict energy balance yields a trivial isothermal solution T_iso, independent of radius, or rising temperature distributions provided T_iso/gamma < T < T_iso, where gamma is the adiabatic index of the gas. The isothermal temperature corresponds to the usual scaling relation between the gas temperatures and the velocity dispersions of galaxies. However the minimal temperature associated with the rising solutions is ~ 0. 5 T_vir, larger than that inferred from observations, the radial distribution of galaxy masses notwithstanding. Heating by supersonically moving galaxies cannot suppress thermal instability, although it can lengthen the growth time up to the level comparable to the ages of clusters when Mach number of galaxies is less than about two. We show using numerical hydrodynamic simulations that DF-induced heating is generally unable to produce stable equilibrium cores by evolving arbitrary non-equilibrium clusters, although it can lengthen the cooling time. We conclude that DF-induced heating alone is an unlikely solution to the cooling flow problem, although it can still be an important <b>heat</b> <b>supplier,</b> considerably delaying cooling catastrophe.

40|$|AbstractFuture {{smart energy}} grids {{will require more}} {{information}} exchange between interfaces in the energy system. One interface where dearth of information exists is in district heating substations, being the interfaces between the distribution network and the customer building heating systems. Previously, manual meter readings were collected once or {{a few times a}} year. Today, automatic meter readings are available resulting in low cost hourly meter reading data. In a district heating system, errors and deviations in customer substations propagates through the network to the heat supply plants. In order to reduce future customer and <b>heat</b> <b>supplier</b> costs, a demand appears for smart functions identifying errors and deviations in the substations. Hereby, also a research demand appears for defining normal and abnormal heat load patterns in customer substations. The main purpose with this article is to perform an introductory analysis of several high resolution measurements in order to provide valuable information about substations for creating future applications in smart heat grids. One year of hourly heat meter readings from 141 substations in two district heating networks were analysed. The connected customer buildings were classified into five different customer categories and four typical heat load patterns were identified. Two descriptive parameters, annual relative daily variation and annual relative seasonal variation, were defined from each 1 year sequence for identifying normal and abnormal heat load patterns. The three major conclusions are associated both with the method used and the objects analysed. First, normal heat load patterns vary with applied control strategy, season, and customer category. Second, it is possible to identify obvious outliers compared to normal heat loads with the two descriptive parameters used in this initial analysis. Third, the developed method can probably be enhanced by redefining the customer categories by their indoor activities...|$|E

30|$|Styrene (ST) is an {{important}} monomer of many petro-chemical industries {{for the production of}} polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile, styrene-butadiene rubber and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene [1]. ST is being produced via a commercial process using catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) with large quantity of steam as <b>heat</b> <b>supplier,</b> diluent and coke gasifier. The use of steam is highly energy consuming, and several alternatives to steam have been studied [2]. The high reaction temperature (873 – 973  K) and latent heat of steam condensation lead to excessive energy consumption for the steam-assisted EB dehydrogenation process. This process also shows the characters of the low atom economy, thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, short lifetime of catalysts, etc. [2, 3]. In this context, oxidative dehydrogenation with various types of oxidants like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, oxygen, sulfur dioxide and dry air gains momentum as alternatives for steam. Among these, carbon dioxide has enormous advantage because it reduces one of the major global warming gases via reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGSR). CO 2 employed in this reaction reacts with H 2 produced in the EB dehydrogenation reaction to yield CO and H 2 O via RWGSR. Because of coupling of EB dehydrogenation reaction with RWGSR, enhancement in the catalytic activity is possible. Most importantly, in this process the CO 2 is converted to a useful co-product, carbon monoxide (2), {{which is one of the}} useful chemicals for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and other organic transformations. Hydrogen can be recovered by the reaction of the formed CO with steam via water gas shift reaction (WGSR). Thus, CO 2 is considered as a promising soft oxidant to replace steam [4, 5, 6, 7]. CO 2 has an advantage over steam in the form of equilibrium alleviation due to coupling of dehydrogenation reaction with RWGSR which increases the ST yield and also requires lower CO 2 consumption when compared to steam [8]. Reports say usage of oxygen overcomes thermodynamic limitations; the reaction can be operating at lower temperatures than the commercial process due to exothemicity of the process with oxygen. There are two main reactions occurred with O 2 : (1) ODH reaction, (2) the coke gasification reaction [9, 10, 11]. The consumption of oxygen in EB dehydrogenation is very less (0.5  mol for a mole of EB). But the process with oxygen as an oxidant has not been realized yet because of significant loss of ST selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates [12].|$|E

The results showed that the electric boilers could replace part of the heat production of oil-fired heat boilers and CHP plants and were beneficial for the integration of wind power and fuel saving. Furthermore, electric boilers and heat pumps have also been reported [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] to promote wind power integration.

30|$|Building {{automation}} {{enables the}} possibility of energy flexibility in buildings. To investigate the motivation and barriers for the energy flexibility in buildings, this study develops a conceptual framework of the readiness for energy flexible buildings by conducting interviews with building automation suppliers, electricity <b>supplier,</b> district <b>heating</b> <b>supplier,</b> distribution system operator, energy service companies, experts in energy and buildings, building managers, and occupants. The two main parts of the framework are building preparation, grid and market conditions following the impacts of regulation and policies, stakeholder collaboration and integrated building automation. A case study of campus buildings is conducted to demonstrate the framework. The result of the case study shows that the main barriers for buildings to provide energy flexibility are 1) many buildings are too old {{and need to be}} refurbished, 2) the benefit of providing energy flexibility to the grid is not sufficient, 3) building management systems need to be either installed or upgraded to response to the demand from the grid. Building managers believe that buildings can provide energy flexibility by building automation and distributed energy resources, but they consider energy efficiency to be more important than providing flexibility to the grid. Meanwhile, occupants have different opinions regarding the comfort level of indoor air quality and control, and the differences are based on various factors, e.g. location, room type, and building ages.|$|R

Demand side flexibility will improve the potential for a smart thermal grid as more favourable heat production units can be used on the TU Delft grid. This project focuses on the potential for phase change materials to increase the thermal buffer capacity. A building simulation model (the ‘Low Energy Architecture’ model developed by Deerns) is used to model three buildings connected to the TU Delft district heating grid. A module for phase change material has been developed and two configurations for the passive use of phase change materials (PCM) are simulated with the LEA model. The PCM used as suspended ceiling tiles and as PCM fins both show a very small potential for phase change materials. The heat transfer to the PCM is too small to show significant diurnal heat storage in the phase change materials due to the low heat transfer coefficient and the small temperature difference between the air in the building and the phase change material.

40|$|In {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) the waste heat of power production {{is used for}} heating the water in district heating (DH) plants. Fluctuating power production in CHP plants may cause unwanted disturbances in district heating networks (DHN), which leads to the situation that the best efficiency in CHP production is not achieved. Although DH -systems are usually automated, the supply temperature is still primarily chosen manually by the operator or it is based on current outdoor temperature. This is because of the uncertain heat demand in near future and uncertain behaviour of delay from <b>heat</b> <b>supplier</b> to consumers, which make the temperature scheduling challenging. In this work, future heat demand and return water temperature are predicted based on outdoor temperature forecast and process data history using neural network predictors. Consumers in network are presumed to be similar, but their distances from production sites vary thus creating a distribution function of range. Delay is modelled as a distribution function based on the distances between heat consumers and the suppliers, which weights the supply temperatures from last few hours calculating the average supply temperature received by the consumers. The brute force optimizer utilizes these models to optimize the supply temperature by minimizing heat loss and pumping costs. Delays are dependent on mass flows, but they are not set as variables during optimizations due to formulation and performance challenges. Instead, the delays are determined for each optimization cycle based on mass flows of earlier cycle and they are iterated as long as delays are converged. The resulting supply temperature curve is a discrete curve that cuts the heat load peaks by charging and discharging the energy content of the DHN. Optimization keeps the supply water temperature and flow rates in control and stabilizes the network smoothly and efficiently after disturbances. In this work, the optimization is demonstrated in case study of Kuopio DHN, operated by Kuopion Energia Oy. Models are fitted and calibrated into Kuopio DHN and the optimization is compared to the measured supply temperatures and instructional temperatures by Energiateollisuus ry. Standard deviation of heat load predictor was 6. 3 MW, return temperature predictor 0. 78 ℃ and for delay distribution model 0. 30 ℃. Main actions of optimization were delay prediction, reduction of supply temperature and minimizing pumping during high pumping costs. Optimization gave savings of 1. 2 – 1. 7 % on heat delivery...|$|E
40|$|A more {{sustainable}} heat {{supply of the}} built environment is needed to reach the policy-goal of a climate neutral economy in The Netherlands in 2050. This paper presents a method of a spatial energy-model to calculate the economic profitable CO 2 -reduction potential of a sustainable heat supply in the energy-demanding built environment in the Netherlands. The model {{can be used to}} evaluate national energy outlooks and to advice policy-makers to improve policy decision making in the energy-field. Objects of analyze are the CO 2 -reduction potential and costs of energy measures. Two main options concerning the type of measures are possible in the model which can be run separately or both. Reduction of the heat demand (energy-conservation) by building measures {{and the use of the}} potential of district heating measures. Options for district heating consists of: waste heat for electricity and industrial plants, geothermal heating, combined heat and power district heating (CHPDH) and systems for ground source heat pump (GSHP). The potential of district heating depends on the local availability of the heat sources on one hand and on the intensity and extent of the heat demand on the other hand. For this purpose the spatial energy-model uses highly detailed geographical data of residential buildings and the service sector. With the aid of energy characteristics for the different types of buildings the heat demand is calculated in each zipcode 4 -area of the Netherlands. Next the cost-effectiveness of district heating to the nearest option (heat source) of district heating for each zipcode 4 -area is calculated by the net present value (NPV) viewed from the perspective of the <b>heat</b> <b>supplier.</b> By considering only the nearest heat source for each zipcode 4 -area calculation time is limited. A disadvantage of this algorithm is that the cost-effective of the zipcode- 4 area to a heat source at larger distance could be better in some cases. So the used algorithm yields the locally optimal solution but gives no guarantee to find the global optimal solution for all heat sources. Nevertheless we conclude that this heuristic approach approximate the global optimal solution. Therefore it is a so called greedy algorithm. We also discuss methods to improve the greedy algorithm. Finally we present some results of an analysis made with the aid of the model. The economic profitable CO 2 -reduction potential of energy conservation and district heating is 15 ? 30 percent of the emission of the built environment in 2050. The range depends on the assumed energy prices and investment costs of the energy conservation measures. The contribution of district heating is 10 to 15 percent point...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), emplaced at the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) {{boundary}} (~ 200 Ma), {{is among}} the largest igneous provinces on Earth. The Maranhão basin in NE Brazil is located around 700 km inland and 2000 km {{from the site of}} the earliest Pangea disruption. The CAMP tholeiites occur only {{in the western part of}} the basin and have been described as low and high-Ti. Here we document the occurrence of two sub-groups among the high-Ti tholeiites in the Western Maranhão basin. The major and trace elements and the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios define three chemical groups corresponding to the low-Ti (TiO 2 3 wt. %) western Maranhão basin tholeiites (WMBT). The new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages obtained on plagioclase separates for high-Ti (199. 7 ± 2. 4 Ma) and evolved high-Ti WMBT (197. 2 ± 0. 5 Ma and 198. 2 ± 0. 6 Ma) are indistinguishable and identical to those of previously analyzed low-Ti WMBT (198. 5 ± 0. 8 Ma) and to the mean 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of the CAMP (199 ± 2. 4 Ma). We also present the first Re-Os isotopic data for CAMP basalts. The low and high-Ti samples display mantle-like initial (187 Os/ 188 Os) i ranging from 0. 1267 to 0. 1299, while the evolved high-Ti samples are more radiogenic ((187 Os/ 188 Os) i up to 0. 184) We propose that the high-Ti WMBT were derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere, and contaminated during ascent by interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The evolved high-Ti WMBT were derived from the same asthenospheric source but experienced crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of the low-Ti group can be explained by partial melting of the most fertile portions of the SCLM metasomatized during paleo-subduction. Alternatively, the low-Ti WMBT could be derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere but the resulting melts may have undergone contamination by the SCLM. The occurrences of high-Ti basalts are apparently not restricted to the area of initial continental disruption which may bring into question previous interpretations such as those relating high-Ti CAMP magmatism to the initiation of Atlantic ridge spreading or as the expression of a deep mantle plume. We propose that the CAMP magmatism in the Maranhão basin may be attributed to local hotter mantle conditions due to the combined effects of edge-driven convection and large-scale mantle warming under the Pangea supercontinent. The involvement of a mantle-plume with asthenosphere-like isotopic characteristics cannot be ruled out either as one of the main source components of the WMBT or as a <b>heat</b> <b>supplier...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Swedish {{district}} heat market of {{today is a}} subject being discussed regarding the reasonableness of the <b>heat</b> district <b>supplier’s</b> price settings. The issue is currently on a government level where a new investigation is being executed {{at the time of}} writing. Many real estate owners are growing tired of the situation where the <b>heat</b> district <b>suppliers</b> are taking advantage of their monopoly position, thus feeling that the price of {{district heat}}ing has been increasing far too much for many years. The market can be described as a natural monopoly because the real estate owner has no possibility to choose another supplier if they are unsatisfied with the present. Consequently, the real estate owner is in a weak situation with little prospect for negotiating regarding the price settings. The real estate owner cannot really do anything but to accept if the <b>heat</b> district <b>supplier</b> decides to accomplish a price rising. The consequences are huge in terms of economics. Since district heat is by far the dominating heating technique used in Sweden today, this is something that affects many people in the end. Despite being an extensive problem, there are surprisingly few people taking active part in the discussion, perhaps because the problem is so complex and complicated. This is a reason for us to shed light upon the district heat market and what real alternatives to district heat a real estate owner actually has. Purpose The purpose is to describe and analyze the district heat market out of a real estate owner’s perspective. By examining the real estate owner’s situation we will describe which incentives that exist for a heating technique exchange, in those cases district heat is being used. Research Method To reach this purpose we have chosen to work with a qualitative method of examining. We have made interviews with those responsible of energy systems for the biggest real estate owners in Sweden. These respondents have been well familiar with the district heat issue and we will describe their current situation and views of this matter. Conclusion Despite being unsatisfied with today’s district heat situation, big real estate owners in Sweden do not see a possibility to replace district heat as the primary heat technique. Heat pumps and pellets are considered as being complements to district heat, and are as such installed where conditions are favorable. The incentives to replace district heat are solely economic. Though, many times practical issues are in the way, such as no physical space for bigger installations. District heat also required less maintenance. Bedrock heat pumps are especially interesting in situations with properties that require comfort cold (offices and stores), since bedrock heat pumps can offer this cold for free...|$|R
50|$|Heating oil is {{used for}} home heating in England, Scotland and Wales, {{typically}} in premises away from mains gas. There are around 1.5 million people in Great Britain using oil for home heating. Great Britain has many <b>suppliers</b> of <b>heating</b> oil ranging from large companies such as BP and Crown Oil to local oil suppliers covering very small areas. Many villages may use buying groups to order heating oil at the same time, thereby accessing lower costs. Many <b>heating</b> oil <b>suppliers</b> will choose to list their prices on independent heating oil price comparison websites. These sites draw in home heating oil users and compare various local supplier prices {{in order to provide}} the lowest price available. In the UK and Northern Ireland, it is possible to search for prices by town name, county and postcode prefix.|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{low-temperature}} {{geothermal energy}} systems {{has been investigated}} though systems modeling, reservoir simulation, and economic analysis. Both utilization of deep geothermal energy with focus on direct-use heat though Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and shallow geothermal energy exploited with hybrid heat pump systems have been studied. To assess power output and economic competitiveness of deep geothermal energy for production of heat and/or electricity, a computer tool GEOPHIRES has been developed which combines cost correlations and economic models with reservoir, wellbore, and surface plant models. Simulations show that low-grade EGS resources (with geothermal gradients of ~ 30 ? C/km) are unattractive for solely electricity production with estimated levelized costs of electricity between 20 and 60 ¢/kWhe. Utilizing low-grade resources instead for low-temperature (< 120 ? C) direct-use heat applications, results in competitive levelized costs of heat (LCOH) between 6 and 14 $/MMBTU (2. 0 and 4. 8 ¢/kWhth). Given that low-grade resources are widely available and the market for low-temperature heat is significant, geothermal energy becoming a major low-temperature <b>heat</b> <b>supplier</b> should be considered. To evaluate the energetic and economic performance of hybrid geothermal heat pump (GSHP) systems for cooling-dominated applications, a TRNSYS systems model has been developed and validated with data collected at a full-size experimental hybrid GSHP system providing cooling for a Verizon Wireless cellular tower shelter in Varna, NY with average continuous cooling load of 11 kWth. Simulations indicate that for the Varna Site weather and operational conditions in the base case scenario, GSHP-based systems allow the owner to save up to 30 % of lifetime electricity consumption in comparison with airsource heat pump (ASHP) -based systems. However, mainly because of lower upfront capital costs, ASHP-based systems can have up to 10 % lower total cost of ownership. A novel approach for simulating transient heat transfer with slender bodies in a conductive medium, e. g. geothermal wells and slinky-coil heat exchangers, using the slender-body theory (SBT) has been developed. An efficient numerical implementation is obtained based on a judicious choice of the discrete elements used to represent the body {{and implementation of the}} Fast Multipole Method (FMM). The SBT requires a onedimensional spatial discretization only along the axis of the body in contrast to the threedimensional discretization for finite element models. Two case studies, heat transfer from two parallel cylinders and heat transfer from a slinky-coil heat exchanger, are used to show the speed and accuracy of the SBT model and its ability to model interacting slender bodies of finite length and bodies with centerline curvature and internal advective heat flow...|$|E
40|$|The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), emplaced at the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) {{boundary}} (- 200 Ma), {{is among}} the largest igneous provinces on Earth. The Maranhao basin in NE Brazil is located around 700 km inland and 2000 km {{from the site of}} the earliest Pangea disruption. The CAMP tholeiites occur only {{in the western part of}} the basin and have been described as low and high-Ti. Here we document the occurrence of two sub-groups among the high-Ti tholeiites in the Western Maranhao basin. The major and trace elements and the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios define three chemical groups corresponding to the low-Ti (TiO(2)) 3 wt. %) western Maranhao basin tholeiites (WMBT). The new (40) Ar/(39) Ar plateau ages obtained on plagioclase separates for high-Ti (199. 7 +/- 2. 4 Ma) and evolved high-Ti WMBT (197. 2 +/- 0. 5 Ma and 198. 2 +/- 0. 6 Ma) are indistinguishable and identical to those of previously analyzed low-Ti WMBT (198. 5 +/- 0. 8 Ma) and to the mean (40) Ar/(39) Ar age of the CAMP (199 +/- 2. 4 Ma). We also present the first Re-Os isotopic data for CAMP basalts. The low and high-Ti samples display mantle-like initial ((187) Os/(188) Os) (i) ranging from 0. 1267 to 0. 1299, while the evolved high-Ti samples are more radiogenic (((187) Os/ (188) Os) (i) up to 0. 184) We propose that the high-Ti WMBT were derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere, and contaminated during ascent by interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The evolved high-Ti WMBT were derived from the same asthenospheric source but experienced crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of the low-Ti group can be explained by partial melting of the most fertile portions of the SCLM metasomatized during paleo-subduction. Alternatively, the low-Ti WMBT could be derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere but the resulting melts may have undergone contamination by the SCLM. The occurrences of high-Ti basalts are apparently not restricted to the area of initial continental disruption which may bring into question previous interpretations such as those relating high-Ti CAMP magmatism to the initiation of Atlantic ridge spreading or as the expression of a deep mantle plume. We propose that the CAMP magmatism in the Maranhao basin may be attributed to local hotter mantle conditions due to the combined effects of edge-driven convection and large-scale mantle warming under the Pangea supercontinent. The involvement of a mantle-plume with asthenosphere-like isotopic characteristics cannot be ruled out either as one of the main source components of the WMBT or as a <b>heat</b> <b>supplier.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

40|$|Context. Heat load {{forecasting}} is {{an important}} part of district heating optimization. In particular, energy companies aim at minimizing peak boiler usage, optimizing combined heat and power generation and planning base production. To achieve resource efficiency, the energy companies need to estimate how much energy is required to satisfy the market demand. Objectives. We suggest an online machine learning algorithm for heat load forecasting. Online algorithms are increasingly used due to their computational efficiency and their ability to handle changes of the predictive target variable over time. We extend the implementation of online bagging to make it compatible to regression problems and we use the Fast Incremental Model Trees with Drift Detection (FIMT-DD) as the base model. Finally, we implement and incorporate to the algorithm a mechanism that handles missing values, measurement errors and outliers. Methods. To conduct our experiments, we use two machine learning software applications, namely Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) and Massive Online Analysis (MOA). The predictive ability of the suggested algorithm is evaluated on operational data from a part of the Karlshamn District Heating network. We investigate two approaches for aggregating the data from the nodes of the network. The algorithm is evaluated on 100 runs using the repeated measures experimental design. A paired T-test is run to test the hypothesis that the the choice of approach does not have a significant effect on the predictive error of the algorithm. Results. The presented algorithm forecasts the heat load with a mean absolute percentage error of 4. 77 %. This means that there is a sufficiently accurate estimation of the actual values of the heat load, which can enable <b>heat</b> <b>suppliers</b> to plan and manage more effectively the heat production. Conclusions. Experimental results show that the presented algorithm can be a viable alternative to state-of-the-art algorithms that are used for heat load forecasting. In addition to its predictive ability, it is memory-efficient and can process data in real time. Robust heat load forecasting {{is an important}} part of increased system efficiency within district heating, and the presented algorithm provides a concrete foundation for operational usage of online machine learning algorithms within the domain...|$|R

40|$|District {{heating systems}} {{are common in}} Nordic {{countries}} today and accounts for a great portion of the heat demand. In Sweden, total district heating end use {{in the last years}} has been around 50 TWh and district heating accounts for roughly 50 % of the total <b>heat</b> demand. <b>Suppliers</b> of district <b>heating</b> must balance demand and supply, often in large and complex networks. Heat propagation can be in the range of hours and it is not known in detail how the heat will propagate during transient conditions. A dynamic model has been developed in OpenModelica and a method for modeling, handling data, simulating and visualizing the results of a district heating network was developed using Matlab as core. Data from Mälarenergi AB, a district heating producer and grid operator, was used for validation of the model. Validation shows that the model works well in predicting heat propagation and temperature distribution in the network and that the model can be scaled up to a large number of heat exchangers and pipes. The model is robust and can handle bi-directional and reversing flows in complex ring structures. It was concluded that OpenModelica together with Matlab is a good combination for creating models of district heating networks, as a high degree of standardization and automation can be achieved. This, together with visualization of the heat propagation, makes it useful for the understanding of the district heating network during transient conditions. Smarta Flöde...|$|R
40|$|Problem Previous {{studies on}} {{services}} {{have focused on}} the perspective of the manufacturer and are {{based on the assumption that}} customers want to buy services from the manufacturer of the product. However, customers also buy services related to a product from third-party service providers or provide the services in-house. Therefore, it is of interest to study services from a customer perspective and the factors that determine how services are handled. This area has been largely ignored in previous studies. The study was conducted in collaboration with a case company that develops and sells heat pump systems. The company had identified the customer segments, construction operators, module rental firms and property owners, beforehand, but wanted to gain additional insights into how to approach the customers and how to develop a profitable value proposition, i. e. how to package their offering in accordance with the customer demand. Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that determine and influence customers’ ways of handling their services. Literature Review A concept that captures the essence of the study of services is servitization. Although lacking a unanimous definition, there are common factors in the different definitions of servitization. The main difference is whether it describes a static or dynamic process. There are also other concepts related to servitization, but they all center around the idea of offering customers both products and services. Literature also describes various frameworks for classifying different services and degrees of servitization. In an attempt to reach consensus, a new product-service continuum is proposed. Moreover, different drivers for servitization, for both manufacturers (e. g. financial, strategic and innovation factors) and customers (e. g. focus on core business), are described. Here, the concepts outsourcing and backsourcing become relevant and insightful. Maintenance is a common form of service, and three types of maintenance management can be employed: run-to-failure management, preventive maintenance and predictive maintenance. Methodology Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, and secondary data was collected through browsing websites and databases. Ten interviews were conducted and 30 questionnaires were answered by customers and service providers. The customer segments examined consisted of construction operators, module rental firms and property owners, and their service providers consisted of machine rental firms, district <b>heating</b> <b>suppliers</b> and third party service providers. These actors were interviewed in a qualitative, multiple case study. The collected data was thematically analyzed based on the research questions. Results The results of this study show that customers within the same customer segment and customers across different customer segments handle their services differently. The way of handling services mainly depends on four factors: structural inertia, level of competence, cost/value-relation and risk aversion and control. It can also be concluded that the customers put limited emphasis into their choices of service provision, which can be due to the relatively low competition in the industry. Although services related to the product are not part of most customers’ core business, it is still vital that the product functions properly. Therefore, it can be argued that the customers should reassess the services related to their heating systems. Proposals for future studies include examining under which circumstances in a firm’s environment it is appropriate to buy more or less services, and validating the results of this study in other industries...|$|R
