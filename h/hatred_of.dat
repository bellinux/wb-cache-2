5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him {{to support}} Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus {{had in fact}} raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

Fancy the wickedness and stupidity of trying to revive the distinctions and <b>hatreds</b> <b>of</b> race between the Gauls and Franks. The Gauls, please to understand, are the 'prolétaires,' and the capitalists are the Frank invaders (call them Cosaques, says Sue) out of the forests of Germany!...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the role <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and its evolution {{in determining the}} nature of peace between groups, or nations, after reaching, and while implementing, truce. It proposes that weak inertia, diminishing memory <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and low propensity to reciprocate hatred are essential for reaching a genuine and stable peace. In the case of mutual abstinence from violence, genuine peace process prevails if both groups have sufficiently weak inertia and strongly diminishing memories <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and low propensities to reciprocate hatred. When these conditions are not satisfied, genuine peace may still be reached {{if one of the}} groups has weak inertia and strongly diminishing memory <b>of</b> <b>hatred.</b> Strong inertia, persistent memories <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and high propensities to reciprocate hatred are obstacles for reaching genuine and stable peace between groups and nations...|$|R

5|$|Fonda {{argued that}} the {{military}} campaign in Iraq will turn {{people all over the}} world against America, and asserted that a global <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
5|$|For Washington is a 1911 American silent short {{historical}} fiction drama film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> them and plies them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in crossing of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, but {{the notion that the}} film was purely a {{historical fiction}} was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

50|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, the National Day <b>of</b> <b>Hatred</b> {{was marked}} by fiery speeches and the burning of paper effigies of Pol Pot. During the PRK years, the National Day <b>of</b> <b>Hatred</b> {{represented}} one <b>of</b> very few spaces for victims of the Khmer Rouge to publicly discuss their experiences from the Democratic Kampuchea period. Also, the event provided an increased space for religious institutions (such as Buddhist temples) to hold functions.|$|R
5000|$|These authors, as {{the name}} of their hero may suggest, tried to provide a {{representation}} of an idealized poet soldier, eager for love and beauty very different from the reality of the violence and <b>hatreds</b> <b>of</b> the actual warfare then raging. Their alternative world is harmonious, fulfilled and orderly, if somewhat melancholy. The themes of the Garcilasistas are those of lyrical poetry: love, death, God, the Castilian landscape, their homeland and nation.|$|R
5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may in some cases {{even be able to}} see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.|$|E

Upon his debut in the WWF, Nailz attacked Bossman and stole his nightstick, which he used to attack his opponents over the following months.|$|E
5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E

40|$|What {{determines the}} {{intensity}} and objects <b>of</b> <b>hatred?</b> Hatred forms when people believe that out-groups are responsible for past and future crimes, but the reality of past crimes {{has little to do}} with the level <b>of</b> <b>hatred.</b> Instead, hatred is the result of an equilibrium where politicians supply stories of past atrocities in order to discredit the opposition and consumers listen to them. The supply <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> is a function of the degree to which minorities gain or lose from particular party platforms, and as such, groups that are particularly poor or rich are likely to be hated. Strong constitutions that limit the policy space and ban specific anti-minority policies will limit hate. The demand for hatred falls if consumers interact regularly with the hated group, unless their interactions are primarily abusive. The power <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> is so strong that opponents <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> motivate their supporters by hating the haters. ...|$|R
