25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release juice to escape. As screw moves further down, the cake pomace is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and natural gums to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a screw press could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and filterable.|$|E
2500|$|Wine presses are {{generally}} classified into two types—batch and continuous. Batch presses involve pressing a set amount (a [...] "batch") of grapes {{with the press}} needing to be emptied of the pomace or [...] "cake" [...] (the leftover skins, seeds and stems) between batches. There are many different styles of batch presses ranging from simple hand operated basket presses to computerized membrane presses and presses that are [...] "opened" [...] with oxygen able to {{come into contact with}} the must or [...] "enclosed" [...] in a tank that allows for anaerobic winemaking. Continuous presses use a <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> (such as an auger) or belt that transports the grapes from a feed in across a cylindrical screen or between air pressured filled pads that presses the grapes, compacts the cakes and then removes the cake through an output all in one continuous operation.|$|E
2500|$|Locomotive numbers 92165-92167 {{were built}} with a {{mechanical}} stoker, {{which was a}} <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> that conveyed coal from the tender to the firebox, {{where it would be}} directed to the required part of the [...] by high-pressure steam jets controlled by the fireman. The stoker made higher steaming rates possible, and it was hoped that mechanical stoking might enable the burning of low-grade coal. It was relatively inefficient, and the locomotives used in this trial were rebuilt to the normal configuration. Simply supplying more low grade coal than a fireman could do by hand did not provide efficient burning. Trials found that the maximum coal delivery rate of the mechanical stoker was slightly faster than firing by hand, and it could maintain that maximum {{for hours at a time}} when a fireman would tire. However this was of little practical benefit in actual service as even a long-distance freight train would frequently stop to allow faster trains to pass or would be held at signals. For the short periods when maximum firing rate was needed a skilled fireman was more than sufficient. The success of mechanical stoker on North American railroads was mainly because the locomotives were significantly larger (with a suitably greater demand for coal) and many routes required hours of supplying coal at a rate beyond the physical limit of a single fireman.|$|E

50|$|The {{solid liquid}} mixture is {{fed into the}} closed {{rearward}} portion of the scroll. The rotation movement of the scroll, screen, and basket allows the liquid to pass through from the openings on the screen (via centrifugal force). The solid remains will be separated according to size due to the difference of the angular velocity of the <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> and the basket. The <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> pushes the solid material to be discharged to the forward end of the scroll. The processing time depends on <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> pitch and the angular velocity difference. It may also {{be influenced by the}} design of the scroll feed opening.

In a dry-running rotary-screw compressor, timing gears {{ensure that the}} male and female rotors maintain precise alignment. In an oil-flooded rotary-screw compressor, lubricating oil bridges the space between the rotors, both providing a hydraulic seal and transferring mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor. Gas enters at the suction side and moves through the threads as the screws rotate. The meshing rotors force the gas through the compressor, and the gas exits {{at the end of the}} screws.|$|R
50|$|Here is some {{history as}} {{referenced}} {{in the forward}} of ASME B18.29.1. <b>Helical</b> coil <b>screw</b> thread inserts have been in use for many years. It was first invented in the 1930s and found initial acceptance in aircraft manufactured and serviced by the Allied Air Forces during World War II. Since that time, applications for helical coil inserts have come into broad usage in aerospace, automotive and industrial equipment. Usage originally included metric spark plus sizes that were delineated in Europe in the 1950s coming into inch using countries in the 1960s. ASME Subcommittee 29 of the B18 Committee put together {{the first version of}} a standard in 1993. In 2010, ANSI approved of recent revisions and ASME published a revision of B18.29.1 - <b>Helical</b> Coil <b>Screw</b> Thread Inserts - Free Running and Screw Locking (Inch Series).|$|R

50|$|The {{material}} variations {{for constructing}} {{and the design}} of main components of centrifuge such as the screen plate, <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> and basket could actually improve the longer life term of the machine. Another important factor is the conical basket size and its angle within the centrifuge. Different basket size and angle between basket and <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> can vary the angular speed; as a result, {{the quality of the}} product is affected. Moreover, the shape of the <b>helical</b> <b>screw</b> is also important since it optimizes the transportation of cake. A selection of typical screen scroll centrifuge with different basket sizes found in the market is presented in the following Table 1. The helical scroll and conical basket sections are commonly built at the angle of 10°, 15° and 20°.|$|E

40|$|Pedicle screws are {{commonly}} utilized in spinal surgery; however, traditional designs {{often do not}} provide adequate fixation in osteoporotic spines. The objective of this thesis {{was to develop a}} novel expanding screw for use in osteoporotic lumbar pedicles. <b>Helical</b> <b>screws</b> capable of expanding post insertion were built on a rapid prototype machine. A materials testing machine performed axial load to failure tests in both Sawbones and cadaveric specimens comparing the new design to traditional screws (rate = 10 mm/min to 20 mm). Output parameters included yield load, ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and total energy. The expanding screw showed a 36 % increase in total energy (p= 0. 02), but no other differences were identified. Based on this initial design, the expandable pedicle screws failed to demonstrate improved screw pullout; however, differences may be observed in other loading modes (i. e., toggle) and further design modifications and improvements in post-build machining may provide beneficial enhancements...|$|R
50|$|Screw piles can be {{referred}} to as screw-piles, steel screw-in foundations, <b>screw</b> piers, <b>helical</b> piles, <b>helical</b> anchors, <b>screw</b> anchors, <b>screw</b> foundations and <b>helical</b> piers. <b>Screw</b> piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer Alexander Mitchell in a paper in Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal in 1848 - however, helical piles had been used for almost a decade by this point. Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s as pile foundations for lighthouses, and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 screw-pile lighthouses were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of 2000 kN. Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.|$|R

40|$|Helical or coiled {{structures}} are {{very common in}} several biological materials, such as proteins and nucleic acids.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{investigation}} {{sought to}} determine the feasibility of a novel method of a percutaneous mitral valve repair. BackgroundPercutaneous mitral valve repair has emerged as an alternative therapy for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. However, current methods that rely on cannulation of the coronary sinus may not result in direct reduction of the mitral annulus area due to the superior relationship of the sinus to the annulus. MethodsA novel device, consisting of <b>helical</b> stainless steel <b>screws</b> connected by a biocompatible tether, was designed for percutaneous mitral valve repair. This device was implanted by implanting the <b>helical</b> <b>screws</b> directly into the myocardium at the posteromedial mitral annulus of 8 anesthetized pigs from the right internal jugular vein. ResultsImplantation of the device resulted in a 19. 7 ± 0. 1 % reduction in mitral annular area and an 18. 8 ± 0. 1 % decrease in the mitral anterior-posterior dimension (both p < 0. 05 vs. baseline). This annular reduction persisted at 3 -month follow-up. Both the coronary sinus and left circumflex coronary artery remained patent in all animals. There {{was no evidence of}} device migration, poor wound healing, or tissue thrombosis at the sites of device implantation. ConclusionsPercutaneous mitral valve repair targeting the ventricular myocardium from central venous access is feasible. By directly acting on the posteromedial mitral annulus, this methodology targets the mitral annular area most frequently affected by ischemic mitral regurgitation, lessens the risk of coronary artery impingement, promotes coronary sinus patency, and overcomes technical concerns that may arise when the coronary sinus lies significantly superior to the mitral annulus...|$|R

40|$|Coiled-coil {{proteins}} {{contain a}} characteristic seven-residue sequence repeat whose positions are designated a to g. The interacting surface between α-helices in a classical coiled coil is formed by interspersing nonpolar side chains at the a and d positions with hydrophilic residues at the flanking e and g positions. To explore how the chemical {{nature of these}} core amino acids dictates the overall coiled-coil architecture, we replaced all eight e and g residues in the GCN 4 leucine zipper with nonpolar alanine side chains. Surprisingly, the alanine-containing mutant forms a stable α-helical heptamer in aqueous solution. The 1. 25 -Å resolution crystal structure of the heptamer reveals a parallel seven-stranded coiled coil enclosing a large tubular channel with an unusual heptad register shift between adjacent staggered helices. The overall geometry comprises two interleaved hydrophobic <b>helical</b> <b>screws</b> of interacting cross-sectional a and d layers {{that have not been}} seen before. Moreover, asparagines at the a positions play an essential role in heptamer formation by participating in a set of buried interhelix hydrogen bonds.
