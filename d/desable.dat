40|$|The Book of Tobit is {{depicted}} by recent Jewish and Christian interpreters as a "religious novel" with historic setting in babilonian exile, but reflecting the cirumstances of Jews in the diaspora {{at the time}} of hellenization. It tells the story of Tobit and Sarah both suffering undeservedly, while the divine Healer heals them through a member of their family. This book underscores the need to maintain Jewish identity in the diaspora and shows in what way family members can be efficient means to accomplish this. Having in mind that Catholic Church and international community strive in our days to rely on families for spiritual and social renewal of mankind, different passages of this book on the family of Tobiah and Sarah have exegetically been analysed: a) The choice of marriage partner in accordance with family education - 1, 8 - 9; 2, 1 - 2; 3. 10. 14 - 15; 4, 12 13. 19 b; 6, 14 - 18. b) The prayer of the newly-weds and for the newly-weds - 8, 5 - 8. 15 - 17; 9 6. c) Sarah 2 ̆ 7 s parents accept their son-in-law and Tobiah 2 ̆ 7 s parents accept their daughter-in-law - 10, 10 - 14; 11, 16 - 18. d) Taking care of <b>desabled</b> parents and religious education of children in the diaspora - 4, 3 - 4; 14, 3 - 4. 9 - 11. This family fulfils its mission by listening to the Word of God, by praising God especially on religious feasts, by practicing solidarity with suffering fellow-ethnics, by its sticking together, by raising their children in the faith of fathers, by tending its sick and <b>desabled</b> ones...|$|R
40|$|The hemispheric {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (CBF) in 32 patients with acute cerebral artery occulusion was measured by means of xenon-enhanced compuetd tomography. Eighteen patients ware treated with endovascular thrombolysis by intra-arterial administation of thrombolytic agents and occuluded arteries were recanalized, while 14 patients were treated conservatively. The CBF and cerebrovascular reserve capacity in the well recovered or moderately <b>desabled</b> patients ware higher than those in patients of vegetative state or death. The mean CBF in the patients with both internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery occlusion was sugnificantly lower than that in the patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion only. CBF study by means of xenon-enhanced computed tomography will be useful to determine candidates for local thrombolysis andto guess the prognoses of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} {{for disabled}} {{people at the}} Rône-Alpes Region constitutes a complex and multi-dimensional system. Numerous actors interact constantly, most of them with conflicting objectives. In this sector, the economic efficiency cannot determine the system performance. As a matter of fact, aspects such us quality of service and human side effects, say pathological or emotional incompatibilities, might play a critical role. In this master thesis we will examine the daily transport {{of children with disabilities}} at Lyon urban center in two main phases: 1) a qualitative analysis of the stakeholders, their motivations and interactions 2) a quantitative study to determine the benefit of optimizing the transport system considering passengers constraints with heterogeneous and reconfigurable vehicles. The proposed optimization problem is not yet covered in the scientific literature. <b>Desabled</b> children; Dial-a-Ride; Indicadores de desempeño; Key perfornce indicators; Metaheuristics; Metaheuríticas; Niños discapacitados; Optimización del transporte a la demanda; Transport optimizatio...|$|R
40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the eightienth anniversary of Merhamet 2 ̆ 7 s foundation, the author congratulates 80 years of fruitful activity of this Muslim humanitarian organization and depicts catholic Caritas with its theological justification and practical work at the level of universal and local Church. a) The endurig foundation to catholic Caritas is Jesus 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward the poor ones of his time as well as New Testament data on early Church 2 ̆ 7 s help for its poor members (cf. Lk 4, 16 - 21; 6, 20. 24; Mt 25, 31 - 46; 1 Cor 16, 1 - 4 : Rom 15, 25 - 27; Jas 2, 1 - 4. 4 - 17 etc). b) Each diocese and parish all along the history of catholic Church in different countries tried to help its poor and <b>desabled</b> members. Some charismatic founders of religious congregations, like St. Vincent de Paul (1580 - 1660), encouraged their fellow-religious to serve the needs of sick, poor or uneducated persons in times when states were not yet able to organize public health facilities nor education which would be available to the children of poor parents. In 1924 Caritas internationalis was founded as a federation of Church 2 ̆ 7 s diocesan and national Caritas organization. Its activities organize humanitarian help for needy persons and regions in ordinary times, in times of disasters and of war. They like coming on the spot to get an insight of concrete people 2 ̆ 7 s needs {{in order to be able}} to motivate their possible contributors in generous helping of their fellow humans. c) The bishops of Banja Luka, Mostar and Sarajevo dioceses revived their diocesan Caritas after democratic elections in 1990 (in time of socialist regime any organized social activity was forbidden to Catholic church). During the 1991 - 1993 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina Caritas imported hundreds of tons of food and medical supplies to Sarajevo and other war-stricken areas of Bosnia- Herzegovina. In conclusion, the author brings out an example of a Muslim lady in Sarajevo who tried to help a <b>desabled</b> catholic vvoman in 1968 and forsees a vast range of work for all humanitarian organizations in after war Bosnia- Herzegovina, especially for those whose activity is motivated by their faith...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{characterize}} {{the intensity of the}} support needs of individuals with severe mental illness. Methods: quantitative and descriptive study that applied the Supports Intensity Scale to a sample comprising 182 individuals. Results: the supports intensity profile identifies groups, individuals, and areas with different needs of support relative to the domains of home living, health, community living, learning, employment, and social living. As a whole, the intensity level of support needs found was low, and the domains with greater needs were employment and social. Conclusions: identification of the intensity of support needs is helpful in planning integral care and detecting professional training needs. The support provision-centered approach, associated with the person-related outcomes perspective, has been sparsely applied to individuals with mental illness, and this represents the main contribution of the present study. In addition, this study introduces novel approaches to assessment that are both concordant and an innovation in nursing because they might provide a tool for understanding other disabilities.
