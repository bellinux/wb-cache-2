50|$|In {{traditional}} Japanese sword making, the low-carbon iron {{is folded}} several times by itself, to purify it. This produces the soft metal {{to be used}} for the core of the blade. The high-carbon steel and the higher-carbon cast-iron are then forged in alternating layers. The cast-iron is heated, quenched in water, and then broken into small pieces to help free it from slag. The steel is then forged into a single plate, and the pieces of cast-iron are piled on top, and the whole thing is forge welded into a single billet, which is called the age-kitae process. The billet is then elongated, cut, folded, and forge welded again. The steel can be folded transversely, (from front to back), or longitudinally, (from side to side). Often both folding directions are used to produce the desired grain pattern. This process, called the shita-kitae, is repeated from 8 to as many as 16 times. After 20 foldings, (220, or about a million individual layers), there is too much diffusion in the carbon content. The steel becomes almost homogeneous in this respect, and the act of folding no longer gives any benefit to the steel. Depending on the amount of carbon introduced, this process forms either the very hard steel for the edge (hagane), or the slightly less <b>hardenable</b> spring steel (kawagane) which is often used for the sides and the back.|$|E
50|$|A {{full anneal}} {{typically}} {{results in the}} second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a full anneal on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is let cool down inside) {{but in some cases}} it's air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very <b>hardenable</b> (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for lamellar pearlite in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{study on}} the hot {{deformation}} behaviour and dynamic structural processes (dynamic precipitation operating during deformation at elevated temperatures) of nickel based superalloy was presented. Design/methodology/approach: Compression tests were carried out on precipitations <b>hardenable</b> nickel based superalloy of Inconel 718 at constant true strain rates of 10 - 4, 4 x 10 - 4 s- 1 within a temperature range of 720 - 1150 °C. True stress-true strain curves and microstructure analysis of hot deformed alloy were described. Microstructure examination {{has been carried out}} on the compressed samples of Inconel 718 alloy using an optical microscope - Nikon 300 and in the scanning electron microscope HITACHI S- 3400 (SEM) in a conventional back-scattered electron mode on polished sections etched with Marble’s solution. Findings: Structural observations of deformed at high temperatures, previously solution treated Inconel alloy revealed non uniform deformation effects. Distribution of molybdenum-rich carbides was found to be affected by localized flow within the investigated strain range at relatively low deformation temperatures 720 - 850 °C. Microstructural examination of the alloy also shown that shear banding, cavities growth and intergranular cracks penetrating through the whole grains were responsible for decrease in the flow stress at temperature of 720, 800 and 850 °C and a specimen fracture at larger strains. On the basis of received flow stress values activation energy of a high-temperature deformation process was estimated. Mathematical dependences (σpl -T and σpl -) and compression data were used to determine material’s constants. These constants allowed to derive a formula that describes the relationship between strain rate (ε), deformation temperature (T) and flow stress σpl. Research limitations/implications: Even though, the light optical microstructure observation of deformed samples revealed some effects of heterogeneous distribution of the phase components, in order to complete and confirm obtained results it is recommended to perform further analysis of the alloy by using transmission electron microscopy technique (TEM). Practical implications: Interaction of precipitation process developed during deformation below solvus temperature and heterogenuos deformation (flow localization) can become a significant aspect of high temperature performance of precipitation <b>hardenable</b> alloys and may perhaps also allow produce specific microstructures of such deformed materials. Originality/value: It is a scarcity of data which are to describe specific features of phase transformation processes in precipitation <b>hardenable</b> alloys.

In fact, when it is necessary to fabricate large plastic components, such as bumpers and dashboards for motor vehicles, the traditionally adopted ISO 1. 2738 plastic mold steel exhibits low fracture toughness and highly inhomogeneous microstructures (continuously varying from surface to core), as obtained from the pre-hardening (quenching and tempering) of large blooms.
