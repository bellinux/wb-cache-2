500|$|The {{kindergarten}} {{reading program}} {{was the first}} step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific educational needs. The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted,</b> and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, [...] "the stimulation of individual interests... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks." ...|$|E

As of 2007, it had an enrollment of 89,912 students and as of 2006 employed 11,100 full-time and substitute teachers in 323 schools.

2500|$|Jean Grey is {{introduced}} in the first film as a doctor at Xavier's School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gifted,</b> {{as well as a}} speaker for mutants' rights. She unsuccessfully campaigns against Senator Robert Kelly and his Mutant Registration Act. At the mansion, she {{is introduced}} to Logan/Wolverine, who shows an attraction to her, which she seems to reciprocate, if slightly, due to her relationship with Scott Summers/Cyclops. She analyses Logan's skeleton and attempts to read his mind to uncover some of his memories. Later in the film, she treats Kelly himself after he is transformed into a mutant by Magneto's machine, though he dies soon after, and repairs Cerebro after Mystique sabotages it to injure Xavier. In the film's climactic battle against the Brotherhood of Mutants, Jean and Storm battle Toad, though Jean is incapacitated when Toad spits solid slime in her face. She nearly suffocates but is saved by Cyclops. She later telepathically aids Cyclops in regaining his visor to defeat Sabretooth, and uses her telekinesis to guide Wolverine to Magneto's machine, freeing Rogue moments before Brotherhood's plan was accomplished. After experiencing the effects of Magneto's machine, Jean appears to be visibly [...] "shaken" [...] by the energy emitted from it. Following the battle, while treating Logan again, Logan admits his feelings for her; she attempts to turn him down politely, but he quickly changes the subject, while kissing her hand.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are very}} few {{specialist}} schools for gifted children. As German schools do not IQ-test children, most intellectually gifted children remain unaware that they fall into this category. The German psychologist, Detlef H. Rost, carried out a pioneer long-term study on gifted children called the Marburger Hochbegabtenprojekt. In 1987/1988 he tested 7000 third graders on a test based on the German version of the Cattell Culture Fair III test. Those who scored at least two standard deviations above the mean were categorised as gifted. A total of 151 gifted subjects {{participated in the study}} alongside 136 controls. [...] All participants in the study were tested blind with the result that they did not discover whether they were gifted or not. The study revealed that the gifted children did very well in school. The vast majority later attended a Gymnasium and achieved good grades. However, 15 percent, were classified as underachievers because they attended a Realschule (two cases) or a Hauptschule (one case), had repeated a grade (four cases) or had grades that put them in the lower half of their class (the rest of cases). The report also concluded that most gifted persons had high self-esteem and good psychological health. Rost said that he was not in favour of special schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted.</b> Gifted children seemed to be served well by Germany's existing school system.|$|E

In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E

6000|$|Now the {{principal}} reason why I am led to admire Oxford {{is that the}} place is little touched as yet by the measuring of [...] "results," [...] and by this passion for visible and provable [...] "efficiency." [...] The whole system at Oxford is such as to put a premium on genius and to let mediocrity and dulness go their way. On the dull student Oxford, after a proper lapse of time, confers a degree which means {{nothing more than that}} he lived and breathed at Oxford and kept out of jail. This for many students is as much as society can expect. But <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifted</b> students Oxford offers great opportunities. There is no question of his hanging back till the last sheep has jumped over the fence. He need wait for no one. He may move forward as fast as he likes, following the bent of his genius. If he has in him any ability beyond that of the common herd, his tutor, interested in his studies, will smoke at him until he kindles him into a flame. For the tutor's soul is not harassed by herding dull students, with dismissal hanging by a thread over his head in the class room. The American professor has no time to be interested in a clever student. He has time to be interested in his [...] "deportment," [...] his letter-writing, his executive work, and his organising ability and his hope of promotion to a soap factory. But with that his mind is exhausted. The student of genius merely means to him a student who gives no trouble, who passes all his [...] "tests," [...] and is present at all his [...] "recitations." [...] Such a student also, if he can be trained to be a hustler and an advertiser, will undoubtedly [...] "make good." [...] But beyond that the professor does not think of him.
