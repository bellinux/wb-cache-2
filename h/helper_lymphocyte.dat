50|$|Gp41 {{is exposed}} with the {{assistance}} of another glycoprotein (gp120) also located in the envelope of the retrovirus. The structural reason is {{based on the fact that}} two gp41 combine with other gp120 composing a trimer. Firstly, it interacts with the receptor CD4 of a T4 human cell (also called Th or <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocyte).</b> The fusion causes an increase of concentration of HIV-1 on the target cell’s surface, and that promotes a switch which increases the affinity of gp120 for chemokine receptors that are disposed onto the target cell surface. This interaction produces a conformational change in the glycoprotein gp120 that exposes gp41. This process would be active because VIR-576 does not interferes in this part of it, but when gp41 is exposed, the developed drug VIR-576 would commence its mechanism of action and the inhibition of the fusion would start to take place.|$|E
5000|$|Jacques Leibowitch is at {{the center}} of the {{research}} on AIDS since the original outbreak of the epidemic, from the very moment when the investigation on its causative agent was launched. When the first series of AIDS cases in the United States were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet in December 1981, Leibowitch noticed the similarity between the cases described in the United States and the historic case of a multiple-opportunistic infection syndrome in a Portuguese resident in Paris who had spent time in Angola and Mozambique between 1973 -76. He was then contacted by Willy Rozenbaum in March 1982 to set up the informal French Working Group SIDA, a self-nominated body to analyse the cases appearing in France.When in July 1982, the first cases of AIDS appear in hemophiliacs receiving highly filtered blood samples, the scientific community realized that AIDS was most likely caused by a virus. Jacques Leibowitch noticed some intriguing similarities between AIDS and the pathology linked to HTLV (Human T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma Virus), the only known human retro-virus at that time. Both situations affect CD4 T <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> cells. HTLV induces the massive proliferation of one or several clones and their cancerization, whereas the other virus, the HIV virus tends to eradicate these cells without apparent discrimination. Otherwise, these two pathological descriptions are present in both Africa and the Caribbean (see. A Strange Virus of Unknown Origin Jacques Leibowitch, Ballantine Books, New York, 1985, translated from Un Virus Etrange Venu d’Ailleurs, Grasset Paris 1984 [...] ). Indeed, in both Paris and Brussels, doctors had seen cases of patients having lived or spent time in Francophone Africa or in Haiti who suffered from a disease with an undeniable resemblance to that arising at the time in the United States in [...] "immuno-deficient homosexuals". Leibowitch, informed by the Franco-American literary author Gilles Barbedette of the announcement by Robert Gallo in Medical World News (August 1, 1982) that an HTLV type retro-virus could be at the cause of AIDS, found in that most succinct brief the profile matching his CD4-tropic exotic viral suspect (in Grasset, Ballantine Books, workS cited). The retro-viral inspiration was thus consolidated and opened between Bethesda (Gallo) and Paris (Leibowitch et al.) from August 1982 onwards. Failing to find in the Paris team of Professeur Jean-Paul Lévy [...] or the Lille team of Dominique Stéhelin a French retro-virus specialist eager to pursue this line of investigation, he contacted upon a recommendation by Jean Paul Lévy Professor Robert Gallo in Bethesda, the then world-renowned virologist on HTLV. It was then in November 1982 that Gallo informed him from Bethesda of his initial virology findings in keeping with the AIDS HTLV-type virus hypotheses. For his part, Willy Rozenbaum, warned in private by Leibowitch that an exotic HTLV-type retrovirus could well be the cause of AIDS, embarks upon a discreet collaboration with the Luc Montagnier team of the Pasteur Institute. Montagnier, along with his collaborator Jean-Claude Chermann, had just recently received news of the HTLV and AIDS hypotheses by Dr Paul Prunet, the then director of « Recherche&Développement » at Sanofi-Pasteur-Marnes La Coquette, where Leibowitch had given a speech at the end of November 1982. The Montagnier team subsequently detected in the cell culture of patient BRU the traces of the first non HTLV retrovirus in January 1983, a virus eventually recognized as the cause of AIDS thanks to the conclusive additions by Robert Gallo and his group (April 1984) sur le site de la Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection, 2 pages. Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for their work. In a letter to the prestigious magazine Nature Medicine in 2003, as well as in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 2008, Luc Montagnier recognizes Jacques Leibowitch as being the initiator of the retro-virus hypothesis in France [...] However, the patented list of the discoverers of AIDS and HIV do not take Jacques Leibowitch into account for his contribution in the initial phases of the discovery. The scientific historian Mirko Grmek reflects back on the details of the stages that led to the discovery of the AIDS virus in his work “the History of AIDS” and the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection contains numerous archived documents on the subject. The book “Sida.O” (AIDS.O) written by D. Lestrade and G.Pialoux contains also many details on the history of AIDS.|$|E

This organ is the primary site of T-cell lymphopoiesis and central tolerance to autoantigens during fetal and early postnatal life. If performed neonatally or in infancy, the thymectomy may cause restriction of these immune functions. Suppression of T-cell lymphopoiesis in children with thymectomy can be estimated as a subpopulation of thymic naive T helper cells (CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA+CD 31 +). To perform this task, we evaluated subpopulations of thymic naive T <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA+CD 31 + phenotype in the children (n = 40) who underwent thymectomy during surgical treatment of congenital heart diseases in neonates, or in early postnatal life.

We have revealed that thymectomy in frames of surgery of congenital heart disease leads to reduced thymic naive T <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 45 RA+CD 31 + phenotype in peripheral blood.

Contrasting with the prevailing dogma that held IFN- � producing Th 1 cells responsible for the pathogenesis of most organ-specific autoimmune diseases it had been noted for some time that IFN- �-/- mice were more susceptible to arthritis and encephalitis than their wild-type, littermates and that IL- 12 was dispensable for disease induction. Recently it has become clear, that Th 17 cells are of central importance for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The differentiation of naive Th cells into Th 17 is triggered by antigen recognition in the presence of both IL- 6 and TGF-�. IL- 23, a heterodimeric cytokine which shares the p 40 chain with IL- 12 is an important survival factor for Th 17 whereas IL- 27, another member of the IL- 12 family strongly inhibits Th 17 production.

In contrast, only less than 6 % of lymphoblasts stimulated with Con-A, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), or protein A, and none of lymphoblasts activated by oxidative mitogenesis, expressed this antigen. Among several permanent cell lines tested, the K 562, MOLT- 4, HL- 60, and EBV transformed B lymphoblastoid cells reacted with the Ki- 1 antibody. The results may indicate possible relationships between the autoreactive subset of T lymphocytes and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is idiopathic, lifelong, immune-mediated diseases, {{for which}} {{curative}} therapies {{are not yet}} available. In the last 15 years, the introduction of monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor-α, a cytokine playing {{a key role in}} bowel inflammation, has revolutionized treatment paradigms for IBD. Despite their proven long-term efficacy, however, many patients do not respond or progressively lose response to these drugs. Major advances of knowledge in immunology and pathophysiology of intestinal inflammatory processes have made possible the identification of new molecular targets for drugs, thus opening several new potential therapeutic opportunities for IBD. The abnormal response of intestinal immunity to unknown antigens leads to the activation of T <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and triggers the inflammatory cascade. Sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptor agonists negatively modulate the egress of lymphocytes, inducted by antigen-presenting cells, from secondary lymphoid tissues to intestinal wall. Leukocyte adhesion inhibitors (both anti-integrin and anti-Mucosal Vascular Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) interfere with the tissue homing processes. Activated T <b>helper</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 12, 23, and 6, offering several potential pharmacological interventions. The Janus kinases, intracellular enzymes mediating the transduction of several cytokine signals, are other explored targets for treating immune-mediated diseases. Finally, the impact of modulating Smad 7 pathway, which is responsible for the down-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor-β signaling, is currently under investigation. The purpose of this review is to discuss the most promising molecules in late-stage clinical development, with a special emphasis on pharmacological properties...|$|R
