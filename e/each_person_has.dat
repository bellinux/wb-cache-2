5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E

25|$|Impulsive buying is seen {{both as an}} {{individual}} trait in which <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a preconditioned or hereditary allotment, {{as well as a}} situational construct which is mitigated by such things as emotion in the moment of the purchase and the preconditioned ties {{an individual}} has with the product.|$|E

25|$|Clifford Geertz, a {{founding}} scholar of primordialism, asserts that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a natural connection to perceived kinsmen. In time and through repeated conflict, essential ties to one's ethnicity will coalesce and will interfere {{with ties to}} civil society. Ethnic groups will consequently always threaten the survival of civil governments but not the existence of nations formed by one ethnic group. Thus, when considered through a primordial lens, ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic society is inevitable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> an {{individual}} profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges {{that result from}} predisposition, learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in intelligence, creativity, cognitive style, motivation {{and the capacity to}} process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, dyslexia, and speech disorder. Less common disabilities include intellectual disability, hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and blindness.|$|E
25|$|In Zoroastrianism {{there are}} {{different}} angel-like figures. For example, <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God's energy. The Amesha Spentas have often been regarded as angels, {{although there is no}} direct reference to them conveying messages, but are rather emanations of Ahura Mazda ("Wise Lord", God); they initially appeared in an abstract fashion and then later became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.|$|E

50|$|It {{is likely}} that public {{ceremonial}} dances were performed for bountiful harvests, health, hunting and rain, like the Hopi Snake Dance. Whatever the ceremonial observance, <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>had</b> a role which increased in responsibility and status over time.|$|R

25|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{rests on}} {{the distinction between the}} passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body. Some proponents of this interpretation think that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death. Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the Unmoved Mover, Aristotle's God.|$|E
25|$|Tax return (United Kingdom) {{include the}} P35 form filled out by {{employers}} for the employees' tax. In the PAYE series, a P60 form from employers proving tax was paid {{at the end}} of the year, P45 a form when employment ceases recording tax up to the end of employment. P11D is a form for employers to disclose expenses and benefits given to employees earning over £8500 that do not go through the payroll. <b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> an individual Tax code (PAYE). Similar abbreviations for forms are used for self-assessment and tax credits, e.g. S100 and TC600.|$|E
25|$|According to this doctrine, God is not {{divided in}} the sense that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a third of the whole; rather, each person is {{considered}} to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and (in Western theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent difference in their origins, the three 'persons' are each eternal and omnipotent. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came to deliver to the world, and is the foundation of their belief system.|$|E
60|$|<b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>had</b> {{their own}} nigger {{to wait on}} them--Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do {{anything}} for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} 210 victims showed that on average, <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>had</b> spent 1.9 hours under {{destroyed}} buildings. Among the victims, approximately 19 had compartment syndrome, 32 contracted impaired renal function, and fractures among their bones were common. As {{a result of}} these fractures neural injuries were also common.|$|R

25|$|Since the , {{a form of}} {{proportional}} representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used. Under the MMP system <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> two votes; one is for electoral seats (including some reserved for Māori), {{and the other is}} for a party. Since the , there have been 71 electorate seats (which includes 7 Māori electorates), and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats. No party has won an outright majority since the introduction of {{proportional representation}}.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has,</b> as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E

50|$|The 1717 {{church was}} {{designed}} to reflect Reform thinking: the pulpit {{was placed in a}} central location, and the pews were placed so that everyone could see and hear more equally. This expressed the concept that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>had</b> a direct relationship with God, rather than one mediated through a church hierarchy.|$|R

500|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{general election}} must be called {{no later than}} {{three years after the}} previous election. Almost all general elections between [...] and [...] were held under the first-past-the-post voting system. Since the , a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used. Under the MMP system, <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> two votes; one is for electorate seats (including some reserved for Māori), and the other is for a party. Since the , there have been 71 electorates (which includes 7 Māori electorates), and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party has to win one electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats.|$|E
500|$|... "When You Believe" [...] is a {{song from}} the 1998 DreamWorks musical {{animated}} feature The Prince of Egypt. It was written and composed by Stephen Schwartz. A pop single version of [...] "When You Believe", with additional music and lyrics by writer-producer Babyface, was also recorded for the film by American singers Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey for the film's end credits and its soundtrack album. Additionally, the song was featured on Houston's fourth studio album, My Love Is Your Love and Carey's first compilation album, #1's. The original version of the song, featured in the narrative portion of the film, is performed by Sally Dworsky, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a children's choir. [...] "When You Believe" [...] {{is described as a}} big ballad, with meaningful and inspirational lyrics, describing the ability <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> to achieve miracles when they reach out to God and believe.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> two HLA haplotypes, a {{cassette}} of genes passed on from each parent. The haplotype frequencies in Europeans are in strong linkage disequilibrium. This means there {{are much higher}} frequencies of certain haplotypes relative to the expectation based on random sorting of gene-alleles. [...] This aided the discovery of HLA antigens, but was unknown to the pioneering researchers.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point that}} Wittgenstein makes against the {{possibility}} of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a box, inside of which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word [...] "beetle". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a [...] "beetle" [...] is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word [...] "beetle" [...] could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object [...] "drops out of consideration as irrelevant". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we can talk about something, then it is not private, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot talk about it.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{binary tree}} is a binary tree {{in which all}} {{interior}} nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

As an analogy, no one can simply make another know how to swim. <b>Each</b> <b>person</b> individually <b>has</b> {{to learn how to}} swim. In the same way, dhamma cannot be transferred or bestowed upon someone. Each one has to know for themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{element of}} {{betrayal}} {{is the reason}} why this crime was considered worse than an ordinary murder; medieval and post-medieval society rested on a framework in which <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>had</b> his or her appointed place and such murders were seen as threatening this framework. Many people had somebody subordinate to them and feared the consequences if the murder of superiors was not punished harshly.|$|R
