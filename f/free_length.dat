50|$|In {{order to}} adjust the rate, the balance spring usually has a {{regulator}}. The regulator is a moveable lever mounted on the balance cock or bridge, pivoted coaxially with the balance. A narrow slot is formed {{on one end of}} the regulator by two downward projecting pins, called curb pins, or by a curb pin and a pin with a heavier section called a boot. The end of the outer turn of the balance spring is fixed in a stud which is secured to the balance cock. The outer turn of the spring then passes through the regulator slot. The portion of the spring between the stud and the slot is held stationary, so the position of the slot controls the <b>free</b> <b>length</b> of the spring. Moving the regulator slides the slot along the outer turn of the spring, changing its effective length. Moving the slot away from the stud shortens the spring, making it stiffer, increasing the balance's oscillation rate, and making the timepiece gain time.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe mean intermolecular <b>free</b> <b>length</b> in {{glycerol}} {{is estimated}} {{over a wide}} range of temperatures by making use of thermo-acoustical parameters followed by measurements of glycerol surface tension.

Glycerol surface tension measurements are extended from 10 °C - 90 °C with a step of 10 °C. The developed model for the evaluation of the glycerol intermolecular <b>free</b> <b>length</b> requires the estimate of the glycerol internal pressure which is derived, in this study, from the Tait equation by exploiting the glycerol nonlinearity parameter and further glycerol properties already measured in a previous study.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Lorentz gas is a {{model for}} a cloud of point {{particles}} (electrons) in a distribution of scatterers in space. The scatterers are often assumed to be spherical with a fixed diameter d, and the point particles move with constant velocity between the scatterers, and are specularly reflected when hitting a scat-terer. There is no interaction between point particles. An interesting question concerns the distribution of <b>free</b> path <b>lengths,</b> i. e. the distance a point particle moves between the scattering events, and how this distribution scales with scat-terer diameter, scatterer density and the distribution of the scatterers. It is by now well known that in the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit, a Poisson distribution of scatters leads to an exponential distribution of <b>free</b> path <b>lengths,</b> whereas if the scatterer distribution is periodic, the distribution of free path behaves asymptoti-cally like a Cauchy distribution. This paper considers the case when the scatters are distributed on a quasi crystal, i. e. non periodically, but with a long range order. Simulations of a one-dimensional model are presented, showing that the quasi crystal behaves very much like a periodic crystal, and in particular, the distribution of <b>free</b> path <b>lengths</b> is not exponential. 1...|$|R
