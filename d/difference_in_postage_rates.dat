50|$|The United Nations Postal Administration (UNPA) is {{the postal}} {{agency of the}} United Nations.

50|$|Soviet {{postal rates}} for the {{despatch}} and delivery of internal mail were changed numerous times. For example, there were about 30 rate changes during the period 1918 to 1966. Only over {{the first five years}} when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic existed as a sovereign state, from the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 until the formation of the Soviet Union <b>in</b> 1922, <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> changed 23 times.

50|$|As {{postmaster}} general, Summerfield oversaw {{attempts to}} reform and modernize the Post Office and the U.S. mail system, {{which was still}} conducting many sorting and processing operations by hand. Summerfield called for an increase <b>in</b> <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> to subsidize the purchase of new mechanized mail processing and sorting equipment. Some of this equipment was adopted, including the Hamper-Dumper internal mail sorting/transport system and the Mail-Flo Letter Processing System, which used conveyors to speed mail processing. However, rapidly increasing mail volume and postal deficits prevented the Post Office from completely modernizing and mechanizing all of its many post offices. To improve the Post Office's image with the public, Summerfield began a promotional campaign designed to showcase Post Office achievements. On October 7, 1954, Summerfield appeared on the ABC television network to introduce an innovative anthology series, The Mail Story, subtitled Handle with Care. The semi-documentary and dramatic program ended its run on December 30, 1954.|$|R
5000|$|The three-cent coin has {{an unusual}} history. It was {{proposed}} in 1851 {{both as a}} result of the decrease <b>in</b> <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> from five cents to three and to answer the need for a small-denomination, easy-to-handle coin. The three-cent silver featured a shield on a six-sided star on the obverse and the Roman numeral III on the reverse. The coin was initially composed of 75% silver and 25% copper to ensure that the coin would be considered real currency yet not worth melting down for the silver. The coins were physically the lightest-weight coins ever minted by the United States, weighing only 4/5 of a gram and with a diameter smaller than a modern dime and only slightly greater than the smallest gold dollars. The silver coins were known as [...] "fishscales". The term [...] "trimes" [...] is often used today for these coins, but that was first used by the director of the United States Mint (James Ross Snowden) at the time of their production.|$|R
50|$|The 1918 Curtiss Jenny Air Mail Stamps were a set {{of three}} Airmail postage stamps issued by the United States in 1918. The 24¢ variety {{was the first of}} the stamps to be issued, and was in fact, America's first Airmail stamp. (The world's first airmail stamp was issued by Italy in 1917). The 16¢ and 6¢ {{varieties}} were issued later in the year to reflect reductions <b>in</b> the <b>postage</b> <b>rate.</b> It features the image of the Curtiss JN-4 airplane.|$|R

5000|$|In 1843, the Spanish {{provisional}} government under General Narváez {{began to study}} the British experiment of prepaid postage labels. Finding the British printers Perkins, Bacon and Petch too pricey, they decided to establish their own printer, and on 24 October 1849 Queen Isabella II decreed that Spain would use postage stamps effective 1 January 1850. [...] <b>In</b> December <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> and regulations were promulgated and the first stamps of Spain were issued on 1 January 1850. There were five stamps in the set with denominations from six cuartos to ten reales in different colors {{with all of them}} depicting Queen Isabella II. [...] They were printed lithographically and issued imperforate. Both thin and thick papers were used, but neither had any watermark.|$|R
25|$|Direct {{flights from}} Malta became {{possible}} in 1931 {{which made the}} airmail service more popular. Zeppelin flights carried some mail from Malta from May 1933 to July 1935. In 1935, Malta issued the Silver Jubilee Crown Agents omnibus set, and {{this was followed by}} the 1937 Coronation omnibus set of 3. In 1938 a new set of pictorial definitives came out with a portrait of George VI inside a cartouche with local scenery around him. The farthing value was reissued like the 1901 version except with a modernised view of the harbour and the monogram GRI appearing on the stamp instead of a portrait. The set went up to 10/- and some of the top values reused scenes from the 1926 set, except larger and brighter. During World War II Malta was heavily bombed and the island was awarded the George Cross by the King, because it had resisted the Nazi and Italian bombardment. In 1942, Palazzo Parisio was hit by this aerial bombardment so the GPO moved to Ħamrun Primary School. <b>In</b> 1943 <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> increased and 6 low values from the 1938 were reissued in new colours to show rate changes. Malta also took part in the 1946 omnibus issue commemorating the Allied victory in the war.|$|R

50|$|Russian <b>postage</b> <b>rates,</b> {{especially}} those of the Soviet times, have not been thoroughly researched in philatelic literature. This part of the Russian postal history is less studied, with comments appearing within some other context. Alteration of the <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> led to the increases in the face value of the stamps {{as reflected in the}} numbers printed and overcharged.

50|$|The {{issue of}} Russian postage stamps is {{directly}} related to <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> force at given times during the history of the Russian postal service.
