5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a <b>freight</b> <b>elevator,</b> which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E
25|$|Warehouse at 50 Morton Avenue. The east {{facade of}} this {{industrial}} building, dating to 1885, was decorated {{to look like}} four Italianate rowhouses. They all have bracketed wooden cornices, ornate cast iron window and door hoods and recessed doors. The interior has its original <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> and open spaces.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the Bumiller Building was {{the home}} of a {{department}} store, Le Bon Marché, owned by the Le Sage Brothers. Le Bon Marché occupied the first three floors and basement. Two <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> {{at the back of the}} building ran from the basement to the third floor for use of the store. After Le Bon Marché moved out, the <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> fell into disuse and were eliminated. Two Otis passenger elevators in the lobby ran from the basement to the sixth floor.|$|R
50|$|The Houser Elevator Company, {{established}} in 1882 and located at 314 East Water Street by 1916, was {{a manufacturer of}} electric passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The companies' {{products}} are {{often referred to}} as [...] "Meskers." [...] The companies also produced tin ceilings, iron railings, stairs, roof cresting, ventilation grates, iron awnings, skylights, and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
25|$|The museum's {{collection}} {{focuses on}} contemporary art from artists {{who live in}} Montana, the western United States, and western Canada. In 2000, the museum's collection numbered 500 pieces. Due {{to the lack of}} a <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> and freight doors, the museum is limited in the size and weight of the pieces it may display.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 2014, it was {{reported}} that the owners of Michigan Central Station were moving forward with about $676,000 in rehab work, and had received permits to install a new 9,000-pound capacity <b>freight</b> <b>elevator,</b> which will allow for the smooth installation of new windows and roof work. In late 2014 work to install the elevator started, with an expected completion by February.|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and <b>freight</b> <b>elevator.</b> The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
50|$|Floors above 92 are {{serviced}} by direct passenger elevators {{from the ground}} floor, by an emergency elevator from the ground floor, and by two <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> that run from floors 44 to 98.|$|R
50|$|The Sky Towers {{residents}} can sleep easy. With around-the-clock 24/7 security, CCTV surveillance of common areas and card access to designated areas. High-tech fire alarm systems, an intercom system, and fire & <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Loading docks may be exterior, {{flush with}} the {{building}} envelope, or fully enclosed. They {{are part of a}} facility's service or utility infrastructure, typically providing direct access to staging areas, storage rooms, and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
25|$|For upper floors, an {{interstitial}} {{structure was}} built for {{the height of the}} building, between the original building and the Fulton Center. This interstitial structure allows the Corbin Building to be made compliant to modern building regulations. A new <b>freight</b> <b>elevator,</b> as well as two passenger elevators, were installed in the interstitial building. Additionally, the interstitial unit gives added support to the Corbin Building. While it provides added support for the Corbin Building, the interstitial building {{is considered to be a}} part of the Fulton Building.|$|E
25|$|Room two led to {{the toilets}} and {{contained}} a small room where food was served and a 17-man crew peeled potatoes for the kitchen. In late September 1933, {{in preparation for a}} large transport of 200 men, the guards' quarters and the infirmary were moved into the house, which had previously been empty. Afterward, the former infirmary became the main torture room and a new infirmary was set up in a walled-off section of room two. Of the prisoner housing, room one was considered the worst because there was an increased likelihood of attracting the attention of a passing SA man, an occurrence that could lead to immediate abuse. Most feared by the prisoners, however, were the torture rooms; the bunker, the <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> and the cubicles, where inmates were denied even the normal camp standards of meals, washing, toilets and the infirmary.|$|E
500|$|Édifice Price, {{despite the}} {{original}} criticism, {{is considered to}} be very well integrated with its surroundings, and well adapted to a lot only [...] wide. Of its 18 floors, 15 are used as corporate space, two constitute the Premier's suite, and on top is a mechanical floor. This leads to conflicting numbers quoted for its floors (16, 17 and 18 have been variously reported), compounded by the fact the retrofitted extra floors are not visible from outside the building. Two elevators, one of which is used as a <b>freight</b> <b>elevator,</b> provide access to all floors.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 {{electric}} lighting was installed. In the 1950s new personnel and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> were {{installed at the}} rear of stage, to facilitate the movement of employees in the administration building and the moving of stage scenery.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of elevators {{was led by}} the need for movement of raw materials including coal and lumber from hillsides. The technology developed by these industries {{and the introduction of}} steel beam construction worked together to provide the passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> in use today.|$|R
5000|$|Each tower {{consists}} of a reinforced concrete central core encompassing the <b>elevators,</b> <b>freight</b> <b>elevators,</b> escalators and vertical ducting. The central elevator core on each floor is protected by automatically closing fire doors. This core supports the floor slabs, supported by columns on the periphery.|$|R
2500|$|Six {{weeks after}} taking office, four federal bank robbers {{escaped from the}} City’s oldest jail, though they were all {{captured}} within 24 hours. [...] A few weeks later the San Francisco jail suffered the largest jail break in City history. [...] A gun was smuggled into the jail’s high security unit and thirteen dangerous prisoners escaped from the downtown Hall of Justice. [...] A year later, one of the Department’s own deputies helped {{a leader of the}} Hells Angels escape by hiding him in a laundry cart and pushing him out to freedom via the jail’s <b>freight</b> <b>elevator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{building}} was a four-story former factory at number 146. Also {{on the grounds}} were a house at number 142, a boiler unit and some smaller buildings. A [...] chain-link fence, topped with barbed wire surrounded the property, replacing a barbed wire barrier that was originally erected. On {{the ground floor of}} the {{main building}} were the kitchen, laundry room and a registration room where all new prisoners were recorded. Above that, on the second floor, were the quarters for the commandant and room three, which initially provided quarters for the guard staff and, during that time, was where most of the torture took place. The third floor was divided into two rooms where the prisoners were housed, rooms four and five. All the windows in these rooms were painted black, both inside and out, preventing prisoners from looking out and passersby from looking in, and causing the rooms to be dark, even during the day. Nonetheless, these rooms were considered the best; they were outfitted with beds, tables and benches in the summer of 1933, and were not as close to the torture area. The attic floor contained a clothing storeroom, an orderly room and prisoner quarters for Nazis placed in [...] "protective custody". Special cells for harsh punishment were the <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> and cubicles under the stairs, where prisoners were forced to crouch for hours.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{there was}} Satan, the head boss, jerking {{him out of}} his berth, {{stirring}} his cramped joints to another dawn of drudgery--two hours of work and two of waiting before the daily eight-o'clock insult called breakfast. He tugged on his shoes, marveling at Mr. Wrenn's really being there, at his sitting in cramped stoop {{on the side of a}} berth in a dark filthy place that went up and down like a <b>freight</b> <b>elevator,</b> subject to the orders of persons whom he did not in the least like.|$|E
50|$|Key {{features}} of former industrial space {{that makes for}} attractive use as a loft include high, unfinished ceilings, large windows, exposed brick or cinder block walls and exposed duct work. Many industrial lofts have only partial height walls separating rooms or areas within the space. Some lofts even preserve the industrial-era <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> that open into the living space.|$|R
50|$|In the Spring of 1989, the {{platforms}} were reconstructed, {{along with}} those of Fleetwood, Bronxville, and Crestwood stations. The baggage and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> were also converted into passenger elevators. Along with Hartsdale and Scarsdale, it is one of three stations on the Harlem Line that features a Starbucks coffee shop inside its station building, a location which opened in June 2006.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{conveyor}} - also {{commonly referred}} to as freight lifts and material lifts - are conveyor systems used to raise or lower materials to different levels of a facility during the handling process. Examples of these conveyors applied in the industrial assembly process include transporting materials to different floors. While similar in look to <b>freight</b> <b>elevators,</b> vertical conveyors are not equipped to transport people, only materials.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was dark, overcast, smoky, damp-the soft, unwholesome {{dampness}} that follows a spell of hard frost. I spent the morning and afternoon on the gloomy third floor of Breck and Company, making {{a list of the}} stock. I remember the place as though I had just stepped out of it, the <b>freight</b> <b>elevator</b> at the back, the dusty, iron columns, the continuous piles of cases and bags and barrels with narrow aisles between them; the dirty windows, spotted and soot-streaked, that looked down on Second Street. I was determined now to escape from all this, and I had my plan in mind.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{impediments to}} freight {{efficiency}} and security {{exist in the}} “last mile” of the logistics supply chain in New York City’s Central Business District (CBD). The “last mile,” a largely invisible obstacle in the transportation infrastructure, is a euphemism for the activity {{that takes place in}} close proximity to the destination, or delivery point, of product ranging from pharmaceuticals to copy paper. The challenges shippers face in moving products and services to small and large business in New York City are representative of the freight mobility problems that occur in congested urban areas worldwide. In focus groups and interviews, carrier and shipper representatives repeatedly reported that inadequate off-loading facilities in commercial office buildings (COBs) were a major barrier to freight efficiency in New York’s CBD. These findings were supported in surveys completed by 82 property managers who provided information on their buildings’ age, size, composition of tenancy by industry, number and size of loading bays and the number and capacity of <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b> Time and motion studies of vehicular deliveries to loading docks at six COBs with floors ranging from 25 - 64 were carried out to determine dwell times and truck size. Despite a 300 % increase in truck deliveries to COBs located in the CBD over the past twenty-five years, New York City has not revised zoning regulations for off-loading facilities since 1972. To that end, requirements for the number and size of loading bays and <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> in five major American cities were compared with those of New York City. It was found that loading bay requirements for New York City were the lowest of the cities surveyed. There were no requirements for <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> in the cities under study. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, loading dock security, which was always a concern, became a major issue for COB property managers. This has lead to the imposition of more rigorous security procedures at many off-loading facilities that have increased the cost of moving goods into the CBD and doing business in New York. The formulation of guidelines for an appropriate number and size of loading bays and sufficient <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> and the development of strategies for retrofitting existing off-loading facilities will offer broad societal benefits that will increase freight efficiency and security and decrease energy consumption, onstreet congestion and air pollution...|$|R

50|$|Dumbwaiters {{are small}} <b>freight</b> <b>elevators</b> that are {{intended}} to carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers. They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually {{do not have the}} same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to 1 m tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{exterior}} is a six-story brick facade {{with large}} windows {{on all sides}} and minimal ornamentation. Originally, the building had a showroom on its first floor, while upper floors included storage space and auto assembly rooms, connected by large <b>freight</b> <b>elevators.</b> The building also contained a body paint shop and a repair shop on its upper floors; to support {{the weight of the}} automobiles and shops, the floors are nearly one foot thick poured concrete.|$|R
50|$|While the buildings’ parcel was {{for sale}} during Hurricane Sandy, {{rainfall}} turned an onsite pit into a “small lake”. The building was therefore developed with precautions against floods and extreme weather caused by climate change.
