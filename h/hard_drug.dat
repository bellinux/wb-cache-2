Sales of the drug is essentially a very helpful community in curing the disease, because it facilitates the provision of drugs to facilitate the healing of illnesses suffered by someone either drug -free or drug sold by prescription given.

25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a <b>hard</b> <b>drug,</b> is legal and a soft drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 survey {{estimated}} about 46,000 <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> {{users in}} the country, with 70% of the users to be within {{the age group of}} 15 to 29. The same survey also reported that 19% of the users had been introduced to hard drugs when they were less than 15 years old; and 14.4% of drug users were attending school or college. Only 12 of the 17 municipalities studied had any type of rehabilitation centre. There has been a sharp increase in the seizure of drugs such as hashish, heroin and opium in the past few years; and there are indications that drug traffickers are trying to establish Nepal as a transit point.|$|E
25|$|Importing and {{exporting}} of any classified drug is {{a serious}} offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis. It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while {{under the influence of}} any drug that affects driving ability {{to such an extent that}} you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving. For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested. Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while under influence of any drug, is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident). Suspension of driving license is also normal in such a case (maximum 5 years). Schiphol, a large international airport near Amsterdam, has long practiced a zero tolerance policy regarding airline passengers carrying drugs. In 2006 there were 20,769 drug crimes registered by public prosecutors and 4,392 persons received an unconditional prison sentence The rate of imprisonment for drug crimes is about the same as in Sweden, which has a zero tolerance policy for drug crimes.|$|E

25|$|Scarface {{was given}} an X rating in North America three times for extreme violence, {{frequent}} strong language, and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> usage. The restrictive rating was more associated with pornography at the time, and it both limited the number of cinemas willing to screen such a film and restricted promotional advertising, which would potentially adversely affect any box office takings. An early scene was singled out {{as the cause of}} the X rating, where Montana's associate Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw off screen. De Palma made edits to the scene and resubmitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), but was again given an X rating. He made further edits and resubmitted it from three to five times before refusing to further edit the film, telling Universal to either release it in its current form or fire and replace him with someone who would edit it. Universal opted to appeal the MPAA's decision. Studio president Robert Rehme attended the hearing which was presided over by his friend MPAA President Jack Valenti. Among those speaking on behalf of the film during the appeal were film critic Roger Ebert, the head of Florida's Broward County organized crime division, and the head of a major theater chain named Alan Friedberg. MPAA member Richard Heffner later admitted that he could have fought harder to retain the X rating, but he believed that Valenti did not support the decision, as {{he did not want to}} alienate the big film studios. The decision was overwhelmingly in favor of releasing the film with a less restrictive R rating.|$|E
500|$|Three {{films were}} {{produced}} by Appian Way in 2013; {{the first was}} Runner Runner, an ensemble crime thriller, which The Guardians Xan Brooks described as [...] "a lazy, trashy film that barely goes through the motions". The thriller Out of the Furnace, the company's second release, was also negatively received by critics and was a box office bomb. Scorsese directed the company's final film in 2013—The Wolf of Wall Street, a biopic {{on the life of}} Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and money laundering on Wall Street in the 1990s. The screenplay was adapted by Terence Winter from Belfort's memoir of the same name. The film was banned in Kenya, Malaysia and Nepal for its controversial depiction of events, explicit sexual content, profanity, and <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> use. Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, becoming the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013. According to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio, the film was the most widely infringed of 2014, as it was downloaded illegally over 30 million times via BitTorrent sites. It was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, although it failed to win in any category.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the <b>hard</b> <b>drug</b> neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
25|$|Legal distinctions {{are made}} in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called soft drugs, and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called <b>hard</b> <b>drugs.</b> Soft drugs include hash, marijuana, {{sleeping}} pills and sedatives, while <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of soft drugs while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs,</b> effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell soft drugs under certain circumstances are called coffee shops. Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a soft drug for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or posession of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the muncipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} alcohol use on consumption of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> using the exogenous decrease {{in the cost of}} accessing alcohol that occurs when individuals reach the minimum legal drinking age.

I also find evidence that consumption of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> decreased by 1. 5 to 2 percentage points and the probability of initiating the use of <b>hard</b> <b>drugs</b> decreased by 1 percentage point at age 21, while the intensity of use among users remained unchanged. These estimates are robust to a variety of specifications and also remain robust across different subsamples...|$|R

2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music.

2500|$|The {{commitment}} to emotional honesty and to core feelings influences the imagery {{and style of}} Matson's poems. [...] Marc Hofstadter located his language [...] "at the interface of consciousness and unconsciousness." [...] Matson would propose, instead, that it's a common state {{of which we are}} rarely aware. In his notebooks, Matson calls the poetic apparatus [...] "machine language," [...] as in computer language, a generative language beneath consciousness. Mainline to the Heart expressed Matson's concerns in hipster phrases and in the cool vernacular of the time, influenced by Van Buskirk and John Wieners. [...] "A state of mind most people don’t know even exists," [...] wrote Jack Foley. During that period he began writing two-line poems, take-offs of John Wieners’ couplets and of Sappho's fragments, and continues those to the present. These are sympathetic to Ginsberg's American Sentences, formulated as a Western, and down-to-earth, version of Japanese forms. Space Age (Croton Press, NY: 1969) added free-flowing, satiric portraits, inspired in part by the lyrics of Bob Dylan and apocalyptic visions of Van Buskirk. Matson's political awareness found some larger expression, largely as criticism or riffs on the culture, in that volume and also in shorter poems written through the 1970s. Heroin (Neon Sun, 1972) recounts Matson's journey with the <b>hard</b> <b>drug,</b> highlighting positive aspects of what the drug teaches. Psychological ironies and challenges are a continual focus, and the volume includes a lengthy reckoning of how to glean value from the drug and how to dodge its pitfalls of both physical and psychological addiction. Ginsberg, on hearing the shorter poems, called them [...] "direct expression." [...] These became material for sections of On the Inside (Cherry Valley Editions, NY: 1982). That volume is an overview of progressive efforts after the turmoil of the 1960s faded from public consciousness. It's a largely intuitive assessment of areas where viable change is in progress, and ends with the observation that cooperation is reliably at the basis of human interactions. Matson sees this as hopeful for progressive change, and this thought is confirmed by recent research.|$|E
