2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again, evincing {{even greater}} {{satisfaction}} than before.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gloomily, {{and seemed}} pondering a serious question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{see what}} the {{mischief}} is," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Those little rascals, the boys,--they have stolen our stones to build a wharf with!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{toward the}} frosty panes, and wraps {{a sheet of}} {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] {{says the}} Policeman {{tramping}} the pavement {{in front of}} the Great Eastern, and <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> pleasantly to show that he is the representative of Law and Peace and that the city of Calcutta is safe from itself for the present.|$|R
60|$|Poirot {{seemed to}} follow my thoughts. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gravely.|$|E
60|$|And Porportuk’s eyes watered as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and smacked his lips.|$|E
60|$|The eyes {{of every}} one were bent upon the Duke. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent {{females of}} getting {{away at the}} first approach, the male {{approaches}} the female during mating season very cautiously. <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> constantly to make its peaceful intentions cognizable. After mating it takes six months before two to five young are born.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{go along}} the passage for a bit," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} at the door, [...] "until {{you come to a}} spiral staircase; and on the second landing is a door covered with green baize. Go through that, and down the long corridor to the end, and the Red Room is on your left up the steps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, heard," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> knowingly; [...] "but {{you have}} seen nothing strange; your eyes are not good enough yet." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> with {{a sullen}} frown, {{and took his}} pipe {{out of his pocket}} again.|$|E
60|$|Captain Truck {{looked hard}} at the speaker, {{and when he had}} done, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in approbation.|$|E
60|$|Deacon {{could not}} speak. His throat lumped and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{as he reached}} for the cards.|$|E
6000|$|Winsome chuckled. It was a soft, gentle chuckle. [...] "Yes," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "we are. You {{can trust}} that little busybody {{to know what}} she is talking about, every time. I {{sometimes}} think she knows more about other people's affairs than about her own. Welcome and I may not look much alike, but we are cousins just the same. Don't you think Welcome is looking unusually fine this spring?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Lucy," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up and down, as he coiled up his string again, [...] "what do {{you think}} I mean to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} brother--I saw your brother," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> as Archer lagged past him, {{trailing}} his spade, and scowling {{at the old}} gentleman in spectacles.|$|R
60|$|Words {{seemed to}} fail the plasterer. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{a great many}} times and spat upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at me {{with the}} most {{complete}} bright confidence, quite sure {{now that he had}} settled his case perfectly.|$|E
60|$|Ernestine obeyed. To all {{appearance}} {{the man was}} {{engrossed in}} his own work, but when she paused <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> appreciatively.|$|E
50|$|Nichol is {{stepping}} through his daily paces in Loblaw’s airy, white test kitchen. Seven product-development staff hover watchfully. He forks {{a small sample}} of what appears to be chilli with meat into his mouth. The room falls silent. He closes his eyes. <b>He</b> swallows. <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The tension breaks. Dave likes it.... This is market research, Dave Nichol style. No focus groups. No marketing surveys. If the president of Loblaw International Merchants, the product-development arm of Loblaw Companies Ltd., likes the taste, it’s in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Lucy," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up {{and down}} with great significance, as he coiled up his string again, [...] "what do you think I mean to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] <b>he</b> cackled, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> childishly. [...] "Stick with it. Don't ever let'm know. You're a good one. I take my hat off to you, Standing. You never squealed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{towards the}} German tutor, {{who had come}} into view across the lawn, talking profoundly with Mr. Britling's eldest son.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Who do {{you think}} we’ve ’ad ’ere, sir?’ he began breathlessly, as the chaise drove off. ‘Red Breasts’; and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> portentously.|$|E
60|$|She glanced {{towards the}} doctor. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly. Then {{she went up}} {{to her husband and}} laid her hand upon his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Bishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father, but <b>he</b> {{laughed and}} <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen you}} afore to-day," [...] <b>he</b> says, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>'ead.</b> [...] "I like a joke {{as well as}} anybody, but it ain't fair {{to try and make}} fun of a pore, 'ard-working man like that." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld {{figure and}} Rick's {{friendly}} business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Privately, Rick refuses {{to sell at}} any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing [...] "Die Wacht am Rhein." [...] Laszlo orders the house band to play [...] "La Marseillaise." [...] When the band looks to Rick, <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Strasser has Renault close the club.|$|R
60|$|For reply <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The scorn of her voice, {{in a sort}} of baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and even}} in the gloom I {{could see that he was}} smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few words}} Sam {{explained}} {{as much of the}} situation as seemed necessary, the conductor listening with interest. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> several times.|$|E
60|$|Billy Towler {{pursed his}} little red lips as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> small <b>head</b> and winked {{one of his}} large blue eyes. A slight {{deepening}} of the red on his cheeks told eloquently enough that he did understand that.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} in a few rapid words. <b>He</b> listened intently, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> every now and then.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Trail {{scowled at}} the young {{passenger}} who had paid no money for <b>his</b> passage. <b>He</b> scarcely <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the stranger, when Captain Franks said, [...] "This here gentleman is Mr. Trail, sir, whose name you have a-heerd of." ...|$|R
