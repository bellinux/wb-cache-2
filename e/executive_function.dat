40|$|Abstract Background: Premature {{children}} {{are at risk}} for problems in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning.</b> These are not only influenced by biological factors, but by environmental factors as well. Parenting style is probably an important influence on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Aim: This study investigates whether there are differences in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> between premature children and term children, whether <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> and parenting style are related and if there are differences in parenting style in mothers of preterm children and mothers of term children. Method: The children participated in seven <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> tests. Parenting style was assessed by the Parenting Dimensions Inventory. Results: Differences between premature children and the control group are found on three <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> tasks (measuring inhibition and shifting), in advantage of the control group. The analyses show negative correlations between warmth and investment, setting boundaries and negativity in parenting and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and a positive relation between structure in parenting and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning.</b> There are no differences found in parenting style between mothers of premature children and mothers in the control group. Conclusion: The differences found between preterm children and the control group in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> are in line with other research. But, literature suggests premature children have more problems in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> than came forward in this study. Also, literature shows correlations between parenting style and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning,</b> some of which are opposite to the results of this study.

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other <b>executive</b> <b>function</b> skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>executive</b> <b>function</b> of {{the brain}} is the set of {{cognitive}} processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order executive functions, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of <b>executive</b> <b>function,</b> such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with <b>executive</b> <b>function</b> in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This review {{provides}} {{an update on}} recent research concerning obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and <b>executive</b> <b>functions.</b> Methods: A systematic review was carried out on reports drawn from MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT (January 1990 Â­ December 2005) and identified from lists of references in these reports. The selection criteria were met by 40 articles. Results: The sample sizes in the reviewed studies varied widely and consisted mostly of selected groups. Most patient samples were heterogeneous {{in terms of the}} severity of OSAS. <b>Executive</b> <b>functions</b> were generally assessed with standardized test methods. Half of the studies assessed <b>executive</b> <b>functions</b> using only one or two tests. The most defected domains of <b>executive</b> <b>functions</b> were working memory, phonological fluency, cognitive flexibility, and planning. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improved performance times, cognitive flexibility, and planning. Deficits in working memory and phonological fluency persisted. Conclusions: <b>Executive</b> <b>functions</b> are the most defected cognitive domain in OSAS.

The {{aim of this study}} therefore was to investigate the relationships between physical fitness, <b>executive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and academic achievement, more specifically to test whether the {{relationship between}} physical fitness and academic achievement is direct or indirect, via <b>executive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Design: Cross-sectional. Method: This study examined 263 children (145 boys, 118 girls), aged 7 - 12 years, who performed tests on physical fitness, <b>executive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and academic achievement. Results: In a structural equation model linking physical fitness to <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> and academic achievement there was a significant relationship between physical fitness and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> (r =. 43, R- 2 =. 19) and academic achievement (r =. 33, R- 2 =. 11). Adding a relationship from <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> to academic achievement resulted in a non-significant direct link between physical fitness and academic achievement (r = -. 08, R- 2 =. 006). However, a significant indirect relation through <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> persisted. The indirect relation between fitness and academic achievement (r =. 41), was stronger than both the direct and total relation (r =. 33). Conclusion: <b>Executive</b> <b>functioning</b> thus served as a mediator in the relation between physical fitness and academic achievement.

25|$|Although {{there has}} been some debate, {{inhibition}} is generally no longer considered to be an <b>executive</b> <b>function</b> deficit in people with autism.

However, performance on the Stroop task, for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that <b>executive</b> <b>function</b> tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.

Results presented in the thesis are the product of replicating Miyake et al. âs (2000) experiments in a cohort of young people that differ from Miyakeâs on a range of significant factors. The aims of the research were to 1) test the premise that sociodemographic grouping has a qualitative effect on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task performance, and 2) to quantify the effects of individual-, family-, and community-level factors on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task proficiency. Initial analyses focusing on associations between <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task performances produced two significant findings: The first was that the Miyake et al. three-factor <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> model (Inhibition, Switching, and Updating) was replicated in the current sample. The second is that the pattern of inter-task associations demonstrated in the non-Indigenous sample was replicated in the Aboriginal sample. Model fit statistics broadly support configural invariance of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> tasks. The second phase that focused on quantifying the effects of capacity, affiliation and environment factors on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task proficiency produces a further list of significant findings. Preliminary between-group analyses revealed positive statistically significant effects of differences in familial socioeconomic status (SES) and level of general cognitive ability (g) on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task proficiency. Subsequent Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) suggested that individual-level (preterm birth, head injury, and childhood health), and family-level (familial SES, sibship size, and sole parent), but not community-level factors, accounted for substantial variance in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> task performance. The results suggest that factors underlying the relationship between early life environment and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> predominantly lie between, not within, families. Subsequent models indicate that g makes an independent contribution to understanding {{the nature of}} <b>executive</b> <b>functioning,</b> but does not fully account for the relationship between early life experience and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> proficiency. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis suggest that the relationship between early life environment and <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> proficiency is quantitative rather than qualitative; those from more advantaged backgrounds perform better on <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> tasks, perhaps as the results of characteristics that differ between families...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The adverse {{consequences}} of violence on society are tremendous. Several {{factors have been}} identified as potential contributors to violent crime, including deficits in <b>executive</b> <b>functioning.</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>functioning</b> is a term used to a describe number of higher-order cognitive abilities (e. g., working memory, inhibition) that are thought to be essential for appropriate, socially desirable behavior. The extent to which <b>executive</b> <b>functions</b> influence the occurrence of general criminality versus specific subtypes of crime is largely unknown. Of particular interest is the ability of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> to distinguish between reactive and instrumental subtypes of violence. Whereas reactive violence is committed with the intention of harming the victim after perceived provocation, instrumental violence is committed with the intention of obtaining some kind of goal other than inflicting injury. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was clarify the relationship between <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> and subtypes of criminal offending, as well as to clarify the convergent and divergent validity of different indicators of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> within the context of understanding crime. Method: One hundred and fifty-one adult male inmates from a federal correctional facility participated in this study. Participants completed both performance-based and self-report measures of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> and their complete criminal histories were reviewed. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, <b>executive</b> <b>functions</b> were differentially related to subtypes of offending. Moreover, findings suggested that (a) performance-based tasks and self-report measures of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> are unrelated to one another and are differentially related to subtypes of crime, (b) it is important to examine separate components of <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> rather than a composite score, and (c) the relationships between <b>executive</b> <b>functions</b> and crime are not accounted for by general intelligence. Conclusion: Taken together, this dissertation demonstrated that <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> is most useful when using a crime-specific approach to understanding criminality. Future research should examine this relationship longitudinally to better understand whether this is a causal link or whether there are other pathways through which <b>executive</b> <b>functioning</b> influences the likelihood of an individual engaging in specific subtypes of violence.
