This review evaluates the incidence and impact of constipation {{on the lives of}} patients with OAB being treated with <b>darifenacin.</b> Methods: Constipation data from published Phase III and Phase IIIb/IV <b>darifenacin</b> studies were reviewed and analyzed. Over 4000 patients with OAB (aged 18 &ndash; 89 years; &ge; 80 % female) enrolled in nine studies (three Phase III [data from these fixed-dose studies were pooled and provide the primary focus for this review], three Phase IIIb, and three Phase IV). The impact of constipation was assessed by discontinuations, use of concomitant laxatives, patient-reported perception of treatment, and a bowel habit questionnaire. Results: In the pooled Phase III trials, 14. 8 % (50 / 337) of patients on <b>darifenacin</b> 7. 5 mg/day and 21. 3 % (71 / 334) on 15 mg/day experienced constipation compared with 12. 6 % (28 / 223) and 6. 2 % (24 / 388) with tolterodine and placebo, respectively. In addition, a few patients discontinued treatment due to constipation (0. 6 % [2 / 337], 1. 2 % [4 / 334], 1. 8 % [4 / 223], and 0. 3 % [1 / 388] in the <b>darifenacin</b> 7. 5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively), or required concomitant laxatives (3. 3 % [11 / 337], 6. 6 % [22 / 334], 7. 2 % [16 / 223], and 1. 5 % [6 / 388] in the <b>darifenacin</b> 7. 5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patient-reported perception of treatment quality was observed to be similar between patients who experienced constipation and those who did not.

We hypothesized that muscarinic M 3 -specific but not nonspecific receptor antagonists would delay gastrointestinal and colonic transit in humans. In this parallel-group study, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and colonic transit were assessed by scintigraphy on days 4 - 6 in 72 healthy subjects (49 women) who received placebo (n = 16), the M 3 antagonist <b>darifenacin</b> ER [7. 5 mg (n = 20) or 15 mg daily (n = 17) ], or the nonspecific antagonist tolterodine [4 mg daily (n = 19) ] for 6 days.

40|$|In urinary bladder, M 2 -muscarinic receptors predominate, {{but it is}} {{the smaller}} {{population}} of M 3 -receptors which mediate detrusor contraction.

In functional studies, affinity values (pKB) for 4 -DAMP, <b>darifenacin</b> and methoctramine were calculated. Similar experiments were performed on tissues following selective M 3 -inactivation (incubation with 40 [*]nM 4 -DAMP mustard in the presence of 1 [*]μM methoctramine to protect M 2 -receptors), precontraction with 50 [*]mM KCl and relaxation with isoprenaline (30 [*]μM) or forskolin (1 [*]μM). In competition binding, displacement of [3 H]-QNB by 4 -DAMP, <b>darifenacin</b> and methoctramine best fitted a two-site model suggesting a predominant (70 – 80 %) population of M 2 -receptors. On normal detrusor in vitro, 4 -DAMP and methoctramine caused surmountable antagonism of responses to carbachol with pKB values of 9. 37 ± 0. 07 and 6. 05 ± 0. 05 respectively. <b>Darifenacin</b> caused unsurmountable antagonism, the apparent pKB value being 8. 61 ± 0. 10.

40|$|Urinary bladder {{smooth muscle}} is enriched with muscarinic receptors, the {{majority}} of which are of the M 2 subtype whereas the remaining minority belong to the M 3 subtype. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the functional role of M 2 and M 3 receptors in the urinary bladder of rat in vitro and in vivo by use of key discriminatory antagonists. In the isolated bladder of rat, (+) -cis-dioxolane produced concentration-dependent contractions (pEC 50 = 6. 3) which were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM). These contractions were antagonized by muscarinic antagonists with the following rank order of affinity (pA 2) estimates: atropine (9. 1) > 4 -diphenyl acetoxy-methyl piperidine methiodide (4 -DAMP) (8. 9) > <b>darifenacin</b> (8. 5) > para fluoro hexahydrosiladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD) (7. 4) > pirenzepine (6. 8) > methoctramine (5. 9). These pA 2 estimates correlated most favourably (r= 0. 99, P atropine (20. 7) > methoctramine (119. 9) > <b>darifenacin</b> (283. 3) > pirenzepine (369. 1) > p-F-HHSiD (1053. 8). These potency estimates correlated most favourably (r= 0. 89, P= 0. 04) with the pKi estimates of these compounds at human recombinant muscarinic m 2 receptors. This is consistent with a major contribution of M 2 receptors in the generation of volume-induced bladder contractions, although the modest potency of <b>darifenacin</b> does not exclude a role of M 3 receptors. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) increased the ID 35 %inh of methoctramine significantly from 95. 9 to 404. 5 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1 but had no significant effects on the inhibitory responses to <b>darifenacin.</b> These data suggest an obligatory role of β-adrenoceptors in M 2 receptor-mediated bladder contractions in vivo. The findings of the present study suggest that both M 2 and M 3 receptors can cause contraction of the rat bladder in vitro and may also mediate reflex bladder contractions in vivo. It is proposed that muscarinic M 3 receptor activation primarily causes direct contraction of the detrusor whereas M 2 receptor activation can contract the bladder indirectly by reversing sympathetically (i. e. β-adrenoceptor) -mediated relaxation. This dual mechanism may allow the parasympathetic nervous system, which is activated during voiding, to cause more efficient and complete emptying of the bladder...|$|E

Adverse effects on CNS functioning are related to muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity and the ability of the agent to cross the blood-brain barrier, where P-gp plays a role in limiting permeability. This {{study provides}} a parallel investigation of CNS penetration of antimuscarinic OAB agents in vivo and assessment of physical properties and permeability in cell monolayers in vitro. It adds further understanding of the roles of passive transcellular permeability and P-gp in determining CNS penetration of antimuscarinic OAB agents. It also enables a comparison of CNS side-effect profiles of OAB agents with preclinical CNS penetration data. To assess and compare the mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) penetration of antimuscarinic overactive bladder (OAB) agents. Physical properties were computed or compiled from the literature. Rats were administered 5 -hydroxymethyl tolterodine (HMT), <b>darifenacin,</b> oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine or trospium subcutaneously. At 1 h postdose, plasma, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS assays. Brain and plasma protein binding were determined in vitro. Permeability in the presence and absence of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was assessed in RRCK and MDCK-MDR 1 transwell assays. Oxybutynin displayed extensive CNS penetration, with brain:plasma ratios (B:P), unbound brain:unbound plasma ratios (Kp,free) and CSF:free plasma ratios each > 1. Tolterodine (B:P = 2. 95, Kp,free = 0. 23 and CSF:free plasma = 0. 16) and solifenacin (B:P = 3. 04, Kp,free = 0. 28 and CSF:free plasma = 1. 41) showed significant CNS penetration but with some restriction from CNS as indicated by Kp,free values significantly < 1. 5 -HMT, <b>darifenacin</b> and trospium displayed much lower B:P (0. 03 - 0. 16), Kp,free (0. 01 - 0. 04) and CSF:free plasma (0. 004 - 0. 06), consistent with poor CNS penetration. Permeability in RRCK cells was low for trospium (0. 63 × 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1)), moderate for 5 -HMT (11. 7 × 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1)) and high for <b>darifenacin,</b> solifenacin, tolterodine and oxybutynin (21. 5 - 38. 2 × 10 (- 6) cm s(- 1)).

Gender, previous exposure to anticholinergics or presence of adverse effects were not related to treatment success. 581 (81. 8 %) of included patients were on treatment {{for the duration of}} the study and 542 (76. 3 %) continued after 6 months. The most significant predictor for discontinuation of treatment was the presence of adverse events (reactions), others were age (younger tend to stop treatment) and duration of problems (those with shorter duration tend to stop). Grade of problems, previous anticholinergic or gender were not related to discontinuation of treatment. Adverse events were reported by 192 patients (27 %). Females reported adverse events more often than males. Duration or grade of symptoms and age were not related to adverse events. Conclusions: <b>Darifenacin</b> is equally effective in both genders. It is the first-choice anticholinergic and is also useful in cases where other anticholinergics fail...|$|E

Typical symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence and nocturia. OAB {{occurs as a result}} of abnormal contractions of the bladder detrusor muscle caused by the stimulation of certain muscarinic receptors. Therefore, antimuscarinic agents have long been considered the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for OAB. Currently, there are five such agents approved for the management of OAB in the United States: oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, solifenacin and <b>darifenacin.</b> This article summarizes the efficacy, contraindications, precautions, dosing and common side effects of these agents. All available clinical trials on trospium, solifenacin and <b>darifenacin</b> were reviewed to determine its place in therapy.

First published April 15, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpgi. 00072. 2010. —Although {{in vitro studies}} show that muscarinic M 3 receptors primarily mediate the effects of acetylcho-line on gastrointestinal contractility, the muscarinic receptor subtypes regulating gastrointestinal motor activity and transit in humans in vivo are unclear. We hypothesized that muscarinic M 3 -specific but not nonspecific receptor antagonists would delay gastrointestinal and colonic transit in humans. In this parallel-group study, gastric emp-tying, small intestinal transit, and colonic transit were assessed by scintigraphy on days 4 - 6 in 72 healthy subjects (49 women) who received placebo (n 16), the M 3 antagonist <b>darifenacin</b> ER [7. 5 mg (n 20) or 15 mg daily (n 17) ], or the nonspecific antagonist tolterodine [4 mg daily (n 19) ] for 6 days. Bowel habits were recorded by daily diaries. Both doses of <b>darifenacin</b> substantially delayed [P 0. 01 vs. placebo (for both doses), P 0. 01 vs. tolterodine (for 15 mg) ] small intestinal transit, i. e., colonic filling a...|$|E
40|$|Overactive bladder (OAB) is a {{difficult}} condition to live with and is very costly to the community. OAB affects 16 % {{of the adult population}} and rises with increasing age. We describe the necessary steps in evaluation and behavioral therapy prior to initiating medical therapy.

40|$|We {{compared}} the density {{and function of}} M- 2 and M- 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the urinary bladder of young adult (3 months) and old (23 months) male Wistar rats. Old rats had a reduced density of muscarinic receptors (96 +/- 10 vs. 156 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein), but competition experiments with the M- 3 -selective <b>darifenacin</b> did not indicate alterations in the relative roles of M- 2 and M- 3 receptors, with the former being more abundant. The amount of immunodetectable alpha-subunits of various G-proteins potentially linked to muscarinic receptor function was unchanged. The potency of carbachol to contract bladder strips was also unaltered; its maximum effects {{as well as those}} of a single KCl concentration were unchanged if raw data or those corrected for strip length were analysed, but somewhat reduced when those corrected for strip weight were analysed. Antagonistic effects of atropine, the M- 2 -selective Ro 320 - 6206 and the M- 3 -selective <b>darifenacin</b> were unchanged. Agonistic effects of the M- 3 -sparing agonist 4 -(2 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydro-benzoimidazol- 1 -yl) -[1, 4 ']bipiperidinyl- 1 '-carboxyl ic acid ethyl ester were similarly poor in young and old rats. Additional experiments were concomitantly performed in submandibular glands from the same animals. While total muscarinic receptor density in submandibular glands was not significantly affected by age (56 +/- 5 vs. 61 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein), the relative contribution of M- 3 receptors significantly declined from 68 +/- 3 % to 57 +/- 2 % based upon <b>darifenacin</b> competition curves. We conclude that aged Wistar rats express fewer muscarinic receptors in their urinary bladder, but there is no change in the relative abundance of M- 2 and M- 3 receptors; this is accompanied by only minor if any alterations in receptor responsiveness. In contrast, submandibular gland expresses similar receptor numbers in young and old rats, but slightly fewer M- 3 receptors in old animal...|$|E
