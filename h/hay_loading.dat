5000|$|Unlike Wallace Nutting, Charles Sawyer rarely staged scenes. If {{an image}} {{contained}} people, cattle, sheep, etc., {{that is what}} was there and happening at the time. [...] "Among the New England Hills", photographed and painted in 1904 in Farmington, Maine, is just such a scene. This pencil-signed photograph contains two hay wagons pulled by cattle, with a young boy atop a <b>hay</b> <b>load.</b> A man stands beside one loaded wagon, {{and a woman in}} a long dress is handing a bearded old man a cup. Mountains are the backdrop for the scene. In life, this was the Voter family on Voter Hill. Other shots of the scene, with slight variations, were also captured on glass film. Other titles focusing on the wagon scene include [...] "Hay in the Orchard", [...] "Helping Grandpa", and [...] "The Last Load".|$|R

50|$|The typical early horse-drawn {{hay rake}} was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep rake, which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed <b>hay</b> and <b>load</b> it onto a wagon.|$|R

And the little sidings of the tiny village station was as pleasant a place as you could wish for. On one side, beyond the line, stretched the woods: on the other, the near side, across a green smooth field red houses were dotted among flowering apple trees. The weather being sunny, work being easy, Albert, a real good pal, what life could be better! After Flanders, it was heaven itself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the barn contains 12" [...] x'12" [...] pegged beams. The main floor is at ground level and divided east and west into two sections. The east area has used for milk cows and is whitewashed; the west area housed horses and young cattle. The upper level consists of several haymow areas and still contains a hook used in the transporting of hay. Gas pipe for the original gas lamps is still in place; several lamps are in storage. [...] When the barn was used for housed cows and horses, the upper floor was used to store up to 100 LT of <b>hay.</b> It was <b>loaded</b> into the mow by a horse drawn elevator.|$|R
60|$|This person's public {{appearance}} in Weatherbury promptly followed his arrival there. A {{week or two}} after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a nameless relief of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence, approached her hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the haymakers. They consisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and flexuous forms, the former being the men, the latter the women, who wore tilt bonnets covered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon their shoulders. Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing in a less forward meadow, Clark humming a tune to the strokes of his scythe, to which Jan {{made no attempt to}} keep time with his. In the first mead they were already <b>loading</b> <b>hay,</b> the women raking it into cocks and windrows, and the men tossing it upon the waggon.|$|R
50|$|Christopher Christophers, {{believed}} to be an emigrant from Barbados, purchased a large tract of land on what was then called Black Point, in 1686. It was probably used for hay and pasturage for livestock. The land passed via marriage to the Manwaring family in 1723, and was used {{at least part of}} the time for cattle. The surviving farmhouse dates from the last quarter the 18th century, and had possibly been built by 1782 when a house farm and buildings were mentioned in a will. The land was sold to Robert Gorton in 1817. A dock was built in 1858, and used to <b>load</b> <b>hay</b> for vessels bound for the West Indies. The large red barn was built circa 1869, the other two surviving buildings, a horse and blacksmith shop, were also likely built soon after.|$|R
5000|$|A beaverslide {{will raise}} hay to a height {{that allows a}} haystack to be built as much as 30 feet high. A large hay crew is required, {{with a minimum of}} six people to operate all components. A <b>load</b> of <b>hay</b> is {{delivered}} {{to the base of the}} beaverslide, often pushed by a buckrake drawn by a team of horses or a tractor. The <b>hay</b> is <b>loaded</b> onto the rack, which when full is drawn up the inclined ramp by cables powered either by a second team of horses or a motorized vehicle such as a pickup or a tractor. At the top of the incline, the hay falls onto the stack and the rack is lowered for another load. The term [...] "butt" [...] describes the hay stacked by the beaverslide and has two meanings. A [...] "butt" [...] can be the amount of hay on a fully loaded rack, but the term also refers to the amount of hay that can be stacked by the beaverslide without moving it, roughly 24 tons of hay. The hay at the top of each haystack is stomped and piled higher towards the middle to allow rain to run off. Depending on the size of the field and the amount of hay produced per acre, once a beaverslide has created a stack, it can be moved a few feet to make a long, continuous haystack, or moved a longer distance to create multiple stacks within a field. Many are built on skids to facilitate being moved from field to field. If the hay is stacked properly, and remains uneaten, the hay in a beaverslide-constructed stack remains good at least two to three years, with some ranchers claiming it could last up to five or six years. In contrast, baled hay stored outdoors can begin to go bad after only one year.|$|R
5000|$|Avery started {{building}} agricultural trucks in 1910. Early truck manufacturers were uncertain how to market their product {{and whether they}} should just be used to haul goods or should also be useful in the field. Avery described its truck as a 'gasoline farm wagon' and 'general farm power machine' for city, town, and country hauling. Their advertising suggested the farmer could use it to haul livestock, grain, <b>hay,</b> and other <b>loads,</b> as to pull plows, road graders, harrows, discs, binders, and other farm machinery, as well as loaded wagons. The truck weighed 1 ST and featured a four-cylinder engine, open cab and chain drive. Its wheels had wooden spokes and rims, while the steel tires were 1.5 inx5 in wide. [...] Avery figured farmers could get the most use out of the machines during the harvest season. Their tractor trucks included a large belt pulley that could {{be attached to the}} front crank shaft, useful for powering grain separators and other belt-driven machines. Early models had cast steel wheels with holes. Wooden plugs were driven into the holes to provide added traction. When the wooden plugs wore down, the owner simply replaced them with new wooden plugs.|$|R
60|$|His {{view from}} the window was a {{pleasant}} one; {{and when he was}} pretty well, afforded him much amusement. The house stood in a neat garden, with green railings between it and the road, over which Alfred could see every one who came and went towards Elbury, and all who had business at the post-office, or at Farmer Shepherd's. Opposite was the farm-yard; and if nothing else was going on, there were always cocks and hens, ducks and turkeys, pigs, cows, or horses, to be seen there; and the cow-milking, or the taking the horses down to the water, the pig-feeding, and the like, were a daily amusement. Sloping down from the farm-yard, the ground led to the river, a smooth clear stream, where the white ducks looked very pretty, swimming, diving, and 'standing tail upwards;' and there was a high-arched bridge over it, where Alfred could get {{a good view of the}} carriages that chanced to come by, and had lately seen all the young gentlemen of Ragglesford going home for the summer holidays, making such a whooping and hurrahing, that the place rang again; and beyond, there were beautiful green meadows, with a straight path through them, leading to a stile; and beyond that, woods rose up, and there was a little glimpse of a stately white house peeping through them. Hay-making was going on merrily in the field, under the bright summer sun, and the air was full of the sweet smell of the grass, but there was something sultry and oppressive to the poor boy's feelings; and when he remembered how Farmer Shepherd had called him to lend a hand last year, and how happy he had been tossing the <b>hay,</b> and <b>loading</b> the waggon, a sad sick feeling crept over him; and so it was that the tears rose in his eyes, and he made his sister lay him back on the pillow, for he did not wish to see any more.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the tractor, when farm implements were pulled by horses, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest against one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>hay</b> cart or wagon. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would ask the horses to pull the load, with more weight added and competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of horse pulling, which is still carried out today with specially bred draft horses bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on sleds are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term horsepower is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by James Watt and Mason Worrell.|$|R

[...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.

[...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then.

[...] There's five: that's all I carry." [...] "I can search you? [...] Where are you moving over to? Stay still. [...] You'd better tuck your money under you [...] And sleep on it the way I always do [...] When I'm with people I don't trust at night." [...] "Will you believe me if I put it there [...] Right on the counterpane--that I do trust you?" [...] "You'd say so, Mister Man.--I'm a collector. [...] My ninety isn't mine--you won't think that. [...] I pick it up a dollar at a time [...] All round the country for the Weekly News, [...] Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?" [...] "Known it since I was young." [...] "Then you know me.

You've been in long enough: [...] It's time you turned around and boosted us. [...] You'll have to pay me more than ten a week [...] If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft.

[...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a <b>hay</b> <b>load</b> a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest."
