There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests.

Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E

40|$|External {{walls and}} their {{components}} {{are subjected to}} a number of fire safety requirements. Fire resistance and reaction to fire are the harmonised requirements in the EU. These cover two fire scenarios: contribution of internal wall linings to an intermediate-size developing <b>fire</b> <b>inside</b> a <b>fire</b> compartment, and resistance of external walls to post-flashover <b>fire</b> <b>inside</b> a <b>fire</b> compartment (resistance to an external fire may also be required). The spread of fire along the external surface is not part of this European evaluation system and remains subjected to national fire safety codes and regulations. A number of test methods covering this scenario exist in Europe and North America at national levels {{as well as at the}} international level (ISO). These test methods and associated criteria differ in fire size, test duration, test specimen size and configuration.

40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} wildland–urban {{interface}} communities affected by wildfire is increasing, and both wildfire suppression and losses are costly. However, {{little is known}} about post-wildfire response by homeowners and communities after buildings are lost. Our goal was to characterise rebuilding and new development after wildfires across the conterminous United States. We analysed all wildfires in the conterminous USA from 2000 to 2005. We mapped 42 724 buildings, of which 34 836 were present before the fire and survived, 3604 were burned, 2403 were post-fire new development, and 1881 were burned and rebuilt. Before the fires, 38 440 buildings were present within fire perimeters (surviving plus burned). Within 5 years post-fire, there were 39 120 buildings (surviving, rebuilt and new development). Nationally, only 25 % of burned homes were rebuilt within 5 years, though rates were higher in the west, the south and Kansas. New development rates inside versus outside fire perimeters were similar. That the number of buildings <b>inside</b> <b>fire</b> perimeters within 5 years post-fire was greater than pre-fire indicated that homeowners are either willing to face wildfir...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveFirefighters are at {{increased}} risk for many types of cancer. While most studies on this topic focus on exposures encountered while fighting fires, exposures at the fire station are also cause for concern. This pilot study aimed to describe air quality within a few fire stations in and around Boston, Massachusetts, and to investigate physical and organizational factors that may influence levels of contaminants in stations. MethodsAir sampling of particulate matter less than 2. 53 ̆bcm in diameter (PM 2. 5) and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was completed at four fire stations in Spring, 2016. Sampling occurred in the kitchen, truck bay, and just outside the station. Data were analyzed to assess differences between and within stations. Interviews (n= 7) were conducted with officers at each station to explore health and safety-related organizational policies and practices. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. ResultsAt each station, levels of contaminants were higher in the truck bays than either the outdoors or kitchen, and varied the most throughout the day. The station with the highest exposures in the truck bay had the lowest levels in the kitchen, which was possibly explained by new building materials and effective separation between building zones. The age and layout of the stations appeared {{to determine the extent to}} which policies favoring exhaust capture were implemented. ConclusionLevels of PM 2. 5 and PAH <b>inside</b> <b>fire</b> stations may contribute to firefighter cancer risk. Through understanding contaminant variability, we can begin to design and test interventions that improve cancer prevention.
