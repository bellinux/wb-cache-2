50|$|<b>Gang</b> <b>milling</b> {{refers to}} the use of two or more milling cutters mounted on the same arbor (that is, ganged) in a horizontal-milling setup. All of the cutters may perform the same type of operation, or each cutter may perform a {{different}} type of operation. For example, if several workpieces need a slot, a flat surface, and an angular groove, a good method to cut these (within a non-CNC context) would be <b>gang</b> <b>milling.</b> All the completed workpieces would be the same, and milling time per piece would be minimized.|$|E
50|$|Slab mills {{are used}} either by {{themselves}} or in <b>gang</b> <b>milling</b> operations on manual horizontal or universal milling machines to machine large broad surfaces quickly. They have been superseded {{by the use}} of cemented carbide-tipped face mills which are then used in vertical mills or machining centres.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gang</b> <b>milling</b> was {{especially}} important before the CNC era, because for duplicate part production, {{it was a}} substantial efficiency improvement over manual-milling one feature at an operation, then changing machines (or changing setup of the same machine) to cut the next op. Today, CNC mills with automatic tool change and 4- or 5-axis control obviate gang-milling practice to a large extent.|$|E

50|$|Milling is the {{machining}} process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece advancing (or feeding) {{in a direction}} at an angle with the axis of the tool. It covers {{a wide variety of}} different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty <b>gang</b> <b>milling</b> operations. It {{is one of the most}} commonly used processes in industry and machine shops today for machining parts to precise sizes and shapes.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924.

NY4 roughly followed the modern alignment of US15 from Pennsylvania to Presho, Indian Hill Road from Presho to Erwin, NY417 from Erwin to <b>Gang</b> <b>Mills,</b> and Hamilton Street from <b>Gang</b> <b>Mills</b> to Painted Post. From Painted Post northward, NY4 was routed along modern NY415 to Wayland, from where it continued to Rochester on what is now NY15. At the state line, NY4 connected to Pennsylvania Route4 (PA4).

From 1882 to 1963 Avoca and Wallace were also served by the New York (Hoboken) to Buffalo Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (and its Erie Lackawanna successor).

It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for maintenance of NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock Hollow Road in Bath as well as for maintenance of Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and <b>Gang</b> <b>Mills.</b> NY333 was redesignated as CR333 as a result.|$|R
500|$|Jacob [...] "Old Jake" [...] Hammersley and Archie Stewart {{settled at}} the mouth of Hammersley Fork in 1827, with Hammersley {{settling}} on the east bank of the stream and Stewart settling on the west bank.

There were no roads in the watershed by 1833. Later in the 1800s, Nathan Tuttle operated a <b>gang</b> <b>mill</b> on the stream. A settlement, also called Hammersley Fork, was created on the stream by 1852. In 1902, John Gartsee started a village called Hammersley in the middle reaches of Hammersley Fork. Its intended purpose was as a supply point for logging camps in the area. By 1902 to 1910, there was a network of railroads in the watershed.|$|R

A four-lane freeway through the Steuben County town of Lindley, US15 crosses through a rock cut, making a large bend to the north and bypassing the hamlet of Presho. I-99/US15 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with CR5 (Smith Road). After CR5, US15 bent northeast through the town of Erwin, running {{to the west of the}} Indian Hills Golf Club. Making a gradual bend further to the northeast, the freeway crosses the Canisteo River and enters the hamlet of Erwin, where it enters a diamond interchange with NY417 (Addison Road). After NY417, US15 makes a bend alongside Norfolk Southern Railroad's Southern Tier Line (former Erie Railroad main line).
