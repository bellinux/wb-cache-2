Logistic regression models were constructed with those having had problems or not from <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> as dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis was done with selfperceived oral health as dependent variable. There were about 10 % (868) reporting problems from <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> There were clear differences between the two groups, having problems or not. The group reporting problems from <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> perceived both their general and oral health as being worse compared with others.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{evaluation}} of a dielectric analysis (DEA) method monitoring the curing behaviour of a light curing <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> in real-time. The evaluation is to extract the influence of light intensity on the photo-curing process of <b>dental</b> composite <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> The intensity change is obtained by measuring the curing process at different sample depth. It could be shown that increasing sample thickness, and therefore exponentially decreasing light intensity, causes a proportional decrease in the initial curing rate. Nevertheless, the results give rise to the assumption that lower illumination intensities over a long period cause higher overall conversion, and thus better mechanical properties.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse reliance on different forms of social security benefits by patients who attribute their poor health to <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials.</b> Methods A longitudinal cohort study with a 13 -year follow up. The subjects included were 505 patients attributing their ill health to dental restorative materials, who applied for subsidised filling replacement. They were compared to a cohort of matched controls representing the general population (three controls per patient). Annual individual data on disability pension, sick leave, unemployment benefits, and socio-demographic factors was obtained from Statistics Sweden. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for differences between cohorts in number of days on different types of social security benefits. Results The cohort of dental filling patients had a significantly higher number of days on sick leave and disability pension than the general population. The test of an overall interaction effect between time and cohort showed a significant difference between the two cohorts regarding both sick leave and disability pension. In the replacement cohort, the highest number of sick-leave days was recorded in the year they applied for subsidised replacement of fillings. While sick leave decreased following the year of application, the number of days on disability pension increased and peaked at the end of follow-up.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of erosive conditions on the wear resistance of aesthetic direct restorative materials. Methods: Six <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> were tested: two composites (Filtek Z 550 and X-tra fil), two compomers (Dyract Extra and Twinky Star) and two glass ionomers (Ketac Molar and Fuji II LC). Twenty disks (10 mm× 2 mm) of each material were prepared (n= 120) and kept in artificial saliva at 37 ˚C for 24 hours. Specimens were cycled in acidic soft drink (Coca-Cola) 5 ×/day, for 5 ’, over 30 days. Initial surface roughness ISR (Ra-μm) and final surface roughness FSR were measured using a profilometer. The wear rate was calculated as difference of final minus the initial roughness (ΔSR=FSR-ISR). For statistical analysis t-test and one-way ANOVA test were used by GraphPad Prism version 5. 03 statistical software. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results: The erosive wear rates (mean±SD, μm) after exposure to acidic beverage were: 0. 30 ± 0. 03 (Ketac Molar), 0. 28 ± 0. 04 (Fuji II LC), 0. 27 ± 0. 00 (Filtek Z 550), 0. 23 ± 0. 01 (X-tra fil), 0. 20 ± 0. 00 (Twinky Star) and 0. 14 ± 0. 01 Dyract Extra, respectively.

Forty-eight children aged 6 - 10 years selected and divided into three groups of sixteen (8 males, 8 females). In group A and B, samples consisted of two class II dental composite or amalgam restorations, while in group C samples were caries-free (control group). Unstimulated saliva from all samples was collected and TAC was measured by spectrophotometry using an adaptation of 2, 2 ’-azino-di-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonate) (ABTS) assay. The Ca ion level was estimated by an auto- analyzer. Data were analyzed with one- and two-way ANOVA test, at a p<. 05 level of significance. Composite samples showed significantly higher TAC and lower Ca ion levels compared to amalgam and caries-free samples (p<. 05). The TAC values showed only significant difference between groups (p<. 05), while the Ca ion results showed significant differences within and between groups (p<. 05). Dental composite restorations increased TAC and decreased Ca ion levels more than amalgam restorations in saliva.

The main focus of the work concerns dimensional changes during setting, hardening and curing and the understanding of the factors controlling the dimensional stability of the system. A range of compositions for research purposes and the composition of Doxadent – a dental product launched on the Swedish market in October 2000 – were evaluated. Furthermore hardness characteristics, flexural strength, porosity and microstructure studies are presented. The studies of dimensional changes led to a thorough investigation of the measuring devices used and their relevance. A split pin expander technique, very simple in function, has been evaluated and improved. The technique is considered to be adequate for detecting dimensional stability in restrained samples, thus mimicking the case for real fillings in most tooth cavities. The dimensional changes in the calcium-aluminate based cement system are mainly controlled by the grain size, the exact composition and the compaction degree.

Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} compare at different times the microleakage of roots filled with Biodentine and white MTA (WMTA) -Angelus and to investigate their setting time, handling properties and compressive strength. Materials and Methods: Root canals of single-rooted teeth were instrumented, filled with either Biodentine or WMTA-Angelus (n = 15 each) with two positive and two negative control roots and stored at 37 °C. Sealing was assessed at 4, 24 h, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks by a fluid filtration method. The initial setting time, handling properties, and compressive strength of the test groups were investigated by a vicat needle, questionnaire of operational hand feel, and universal instron machine, respectively. Results: Significant differences in microleakage were found between two groups at 4 -h and 24 h (P < 0. 05) and no difference at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. No significant difference was seen in the setting time of MTA-Angelus and Biodentine, though latter was found to have better handling consistency.

40|$|Light-curing dental {{composites}} {{have found}} widespread application in dental restorations {{due to their}} tooth-like appearance and easy handling. The development of »adhesive dentistry« (i. e. the use of bonding agents which improve the bond strength between tooth and filling) increased the range application of light curing dental composites e. g. {{in the area of}} minimal invasive procedures. Despite intensive research, these composites still introduce internal stresses into the restoration due to the polymerisation shrinkage during curing. These stresses can compromise the marginal integrity and lead to secondary caries, cause initial damage to the material during hardening, and promote chemical and mechanical degradation. The stresses result from a complex interplay between geometry of the cavity, increasing stiffness, decreasing flowability, and changes in the density of the material due to thermal expansion and polymerisation shrinkage. We developed a dedicated mechanical testing set-up which measures stiffness, viscosity, and volume behaviour of the composites during the hardening reaction.

40|$|Inflammation around {{teeth and}} dental {{implants}} {{is considered to}} be due to microorganisms producing biofilm and thereby initiating the inflammatory reaction. The etiology is not yet fully understood though many risk factors have been identified, e. g. smoking, oral hygiene, stress etc. That surface roughness plays a role both {{in the development of the}} biofilm and discoloration of teeth is nowadays beyond doubt. To create a smooth surface is an important part of the oral hygiene regime. Toothbrushing with and without toothpastes can influence the surface roughness in different ways. The ultimate goal is to remove the biofilm together with the discoloration without removing the tooth substance and in the same time create a surface that is smooth in order to prevent the development of new biofilm and discoloration. Hence the importance of having a reliable method for measuring toothpaste and toothbrush abrasivity is obvious. This is also applicable regarding the development of new <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> especially in the anterior region w here, besides bacterial accumulation, discoloration otherwise can be a problem. The present thesis is based on four in vitro studies which all utilizes the profilometer technique for analysis of surface roughness caused by toothbrushing with and without toothpastes. In one of the studies, the additional effect of surface roughness on bacterial accumulation is investigated. The main findings from the present thesis are that the profilomet er technique, described in paper I, constitutes a possibility to measure the abrasive effect of a toothpaste or toothbrush in both a qualitative,(i. e. the roughness of the surface) and quantitative,(i. e. how much of the surface that have been abraded), way. Furthermore, it has been shown that a softer toothbrush can cause equal or even more abrasion than a harder one and that toothbrushing with toothpastes on dental materials influences the materials in different ways, i. e. causing either rougher or smoother surfaces. Finally, the bacterial accumulation on titanium was not influenced by the surface roughness. Although, these studies being in vitro studies, the impact on the clinical reality is huge. The “gold standard “ for measuring toothpaste abrasivity has been challenged, the opinion that softer toothbrushes always should be recommended is also questioned. It is extremely important for manufacturers of dental materials to consider the wear resistance as far as toothbrushing with toothpastes is concerned. Periimplantitis is a worldwide growing problem, where the present study has focused on surface roughness which constitutes an important aspect that needs further research...|$|E

Um eine gute Verbindung mit dem Dentin zu gewährleisten, ist eine hohe Polarität eine grundlegende Anforderung an ein nutzbares Polymer. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt die Synthese und Charakterisierung hochpolarer Monomere auf der Basis phosphonsäurehaltiger Methacrylverbindungen. Ausgehend vom Ethylester der 2 -Hydroxymethyl-acrylsäure konnte nach der Substitution der Hydroxylfunktion durch Brom, die Phophonsäuregruppe durch eine anschließende Michaelis-Arbuzov-Reaktion eingeführt werden. Neben monofunktionellen Verbindungen konnte in einer analogen Umsetzung mit Bis-(diethoxyphosphino) -methan eine bifunktionelle Verbindung hergestellt werden. Aufgrund einer selektiven Hydrolyse des Carbonsäureesters konnten unter Verwendung eines Kupplungsreagenz sowohl mono- als auch bifunktionelle Amide synthetisiert werden. In Polymerisationsversuchen wurden mono- und bifunktionelle Monomerprodukte mit einer Reihe von Radikalinitiatoren umgesetzt. Im Gegensatz zur Copolymerisation waren Versuche zur Homopolymerisation nicht erfolgreich, was vermutlich durch eine sterische Hinderung durch die Phosphonsäuregruppe begründet ist. Die Möglichkeit enzymatischer Umsetzungen der 2 -Hydroxymethyl-acrylsäure wurde anhand einer Screening-Reihe von Reaktionen ihres Ethylesters mit verschiedenen Fettsäuren unter der Katalyse von Candida {{antarctica}} untersucht. Exemplarisch wurde anschließend der Ester, 2 -Dodecanoyloxymethyl-acrylsäureethylester, sowohl homo- als auch copolymerisiert. <b>Dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> {{have to meet}} {{many different}} requirements for good and durable adhesion to the tooth. Different {{studies have shown that}} hydrophilic polar monomers of low viscosity are able to penetrate a demineralized dentine, resulting in a very good adhesion to the dentine after polymerization. To achieve good penetration, one of the most favorable monomers so far is 2 -methyl-acrylic acid 2 -hydroxy-ethyl ester. In the present work new phosphorous containing monomers with high polarity were synthesized to improve the adhesion to the dentine itself. Starting from 2 -hydroxymethyl acrylic acid ethyl ester the aim was to substitute the hydroxyl group with a phosphonic acid group. For this purpose the hydroxyl group was substituted by bromine, which came out to be the best halogen for the following Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction. Furthermore amide derivatives of the yielded monomers were synthesized by condensation of aliphatic amino compounds to the free carboxylic acid group with help of EDC. The use of aliphatic diamino compounds resulted in monomers which are able to build cross-linked polymers. Since the performance of resulting polymers is important to the utility of materials in dental medicine, the feasibility of polymerization was examined. Furthermore, 2 -hydroxymethyl acrylic acid was selectively esterified by enzymatic reaction with different aliphatic carboxylic acids. The kinetic behaviour of the reaction in dependence of the used alcohol was examined. It was found that unsaturated 10 -undecanoic acid reacts faster than dodecanoic and phenylundecanioc acid. As an example dodecanoic acid containing monomer was homo- and copolymerized as well...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{resin-based}} dental restorative materials have replaced amalgam as the first choice <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>material.</b> Resin-based <b>dental</b> restorative materials are complex polymers containing a variety of monomers and filler particles, as well as initiators, activators, stabilizers, plasticizers and other additives. Several {{studies have shown that}} many of the ingredients are leaching from the materials, even after adequate polymerization. It is known from in vitro studies that some of the compounds in the resin-based materials have cytotoxic, genotoxic or estrogenic potential. Allergenic effects in patients and dental personnel have also been reported. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify substances released from various types of resin-based dental restorative materials. Specimens were polymerized according to protocols from the producers and submerged in different solvents. To characterize a maximum elution potential, ethanol was used as an immersion media. Furthermore, immersion in Ringer’s solution and saliva was used to mimic clinical elution conditions. A combined Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) technique was used for the identification and quantification of eluates. The majority of eluting substances from the polymeric matrix are organic substances with low molecular weight, which are well suited for analysis by GC-MS. Tailor-made internal standards for HEMA and TEGDMA were synthesized for the quantification procedure. We have identified and quantified a number of compounds from several materials. Significant differences regarding type and amount of leachables between the materials are observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dental assistants {{help the}} dentist in {{preparing}} <b>material</b> for <b>filling</b> teeth. Amalgam was the <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> mostly {{commonly used in}} Norway before 1980, and declined to about 5 % of all fillings in 2005. Amalgam is usually an alloy of silver, copper, tin and mercury. Copper amalgam, giving particularly high exposure to mercury was used in Norway until 1994. Metallic mercury is neurotoxic. Few studies of the health of dental assistants exist, despite their exposure to mercury. There are questions {{about the existence of}} possible chronic neurological symptoms today within this working group, due to this exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the occurrence of neurological symptoms among dental assistants likely to be exposed to mercury from work with <b>dental</b> <b>filling</b> <b>material,</b> compared to similar health personnel with no such exposure. Methods All dental assistants still at work and born before 1970 registered in the archives of a trade union in Hordaland county of Norway were invited to participate (response rate 68 %, n = 41), as well as a similar number of randomly selected assistant nurses (response rate 87 %, n = 64) in the same age group. The participants completed a self-administered, mailed questionnaire, with questions about demographic variables, life-style factors, musculoskeletal, neurological and psychosomatic symptoms (Euroquest). Results The dental assistants reported significant higher occurrence of neurological symptoms; psychosomatic symptoms, problems with memory, concentration, fatigue and sleep disturbance, but not for mood. This was found by analyses of variance, adjusting for age, education, alcohol consumption, smoking and personality traits. For each specific neurological symptom, adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed, showing that these symptoms were mainly from arms, hands, legs and balance organs. Conclusion There is a possibility that the higher occurrence of neurological symptoms among the dental assistants may be related to their previous work exposure to mercury amalgam fillings. This should be studied further to assess the clinical importance of the reported symptoms. </p...|$|R
