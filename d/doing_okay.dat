Mr Brumby reckoned Victoria’s system led the way and suggested a different model. A few states joined in, chanting “more money. ” Others joined Mr Rudd to paint Mr Brumby as a potential wrecker of policy unity. Mr Rudd didn’t want to take over public hospitals nationwide, but he wanted to put the Commonwealth in the driver’s seat. Now imagine you ran a loose but supposedly cooperative enterprise.
