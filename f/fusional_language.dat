5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and <b>fusional</b> <b>language,</b> and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese grammar, the {{morphology}} and syntax of the Portuguese language, {{is similar}} to the grammar of most other Romance languages — especially that of Spanish, and even more so to that of Galician. It is a relatively synthetic, <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{not being}} a <b>fusional</b> <b>language,</b> Tlingit is still highly {{synthetic}} as an agglutinating language, and is even polysynthetic to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically incorporating. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.|$|E
50|$|These {{categories}} {{give rise}} to highly non-traditional distributions of typological traits. For example, high exponence for nouns (e.g. case + number) is typically {{thought of as a}} trait of <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b> However, it is absent in many traditionally <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> like French, Spanish, and Arabic but present in many traditionally agglutinative languages like Finnish, Yaqui, and Cree.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, English is {{moderately}} analytic, and it and Afrikaans can {{be considered}} as some of the most analytic of all Indo-European languages. However, they are traditionally analyzed as <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{three models}} of {{morphology}} stem from attempts to analyze languages that {{more or less}} match different categories in this typology. The item-and-arrangement approach fits very naturally with agglutinative languages. The item-and-process and word-and-paradigm approaches usually address <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
25|$|Navajo is {{difficult}} to classify in terms of broad morphological typology: it relies heavily on affixes—mainly prefixes—like agglutinative languages, but these affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult to segment, a trait of fusional languages. In general, Navajo verbs contain more morphemes than do nouns (on average, 11 for verbs compared to 4–5 for nouns), but noun morphology is less transparent. Navajo is sometimes classified as a <b>fusional</b> <b>language</b> and sometimes as agglutinative or even polysynthetic.|$|E
25|$|Skolt Sami is a synthetic, highly inflected {{language}} that shares many grammatical features {{with the other}} Uralic languages. However, Skolt Sami is not a typical agglutinative language {{like many of the}} other Uralic languages are, as it has developed considerably into the direction of a <b>fusional</b> <b>language,</b> much like Estonian. Therefore, cases and other grammatical features are also marked by modifications to the root and not just marked with suffixes. Many of the suffixes in Skolt Sami are portmanteau morphemes that express several grammatical features at a time.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the largely}} agglutinative Quenya, Sindarin is mainly a <b>fusional</b> <b>language</b> with some {{analytic}} tendencies. It {{can be distinguished}} from Quenya by the rarity of vowel endings, {{and the use of}} voiced plosives b d g, absent from Quenya (except in intervocalic clusters mb, nd, ng, ld, rd). [...] Early Sindarin formed plurals by the addition of -ī, which vanished but affected the preceding vowels (as in Welsh and Old English): S. Adan, pl. Edain, S. Orch, pl. Yrch.|$|E
5000|$|Morphological {{typology}} {{is a way}} of classifying {{the languages}} of the world (see linguistic typology) that groups languages according to their common morphological structures. The field organizes languages on the basis of how those languages form words by combining morphemes. Analytic languages contain very little inflection, instead relying on features like word order and auxiliary words to convey meaning. Synthetic languages, ones that are not analytic, are divided into two categories: agglutinative and <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b> Agglutinative languages rely primarily on discrete particles (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes) for inflection, while <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> [...] "fuse" [...] inflectional categories together, often allowing one word ending to contain several categories, such that the original root can be difficult to extract. A further subcategory of agglutinative languages are polysynthetic languages, which take agglutination to a higher level by constructing entire sentences, including nouns, as one word.|$|R
50|$|Typologically, Tlinchon is an agglutinating, polysynthetic head-marking language, {{but many}} of its affixes combine into contractions more like <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b> The {{canonical}} word order of Tlinchon is SOV. Tlinchon words are modified primarily by prefixes, which is unusual for an SOV language (suffixes are expected).|$|R
5000|$|An agglutinative {{language}} {{is a type of}} synthetic language with morphology that primarily uses agglutination: words may contain different morphemes to determine their meaning, but each of these morphemes (including stems and affixes) remains in every aspect unchanged after their union, thus resulting in generally more easily deducible word meanings if compared to <b>fusional</b> <b>languages,</b> which allow modifications in either or both the phonetics or spelling of one or more morphemes within a word, usually shortening the word or providing easier pronunciation. Agglutinative languages have generally one grammatical category per affix while <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> have multiple. The term was introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt to classify languages from a morphological point of view. It is derived from the Latin verb agglutinare, which means [...] "to glue together".|$|R
2500|$|Latin is a synthetic, <b>fusional</b> <b>language</b> in the {{terminology}} of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, {{it is an}} inflected language, but typologists are apt to say [...] "inflecting". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: amō, [...] "I love," [...] is produced from a semantic element, ama-, [...] "love," [...] to which -ō, a first person singular marker, is suffixed.|$|E
50|$|Ayoreo is a <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
50|$|Western Lombard is a {{synthetic}} <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the challenges of}} resource creation for a resource-light system for morphological tagging of <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> (Feldman and Hana, 2010). The constraints on resources (time, expertise, and money) introduce challenges that are not present in development of morphological tools and corpora in the usual, resource intensive way. ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} {{is to not}} understand the name of Vinland as fixed to one defined location, but as merely referring to every location where vínber could be found, i.e. to understand it as a common noun, vinland, {{rather than as a}} toponym, Vinland. The Old Norse and Icelandic languages were, and are, <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Morphemes in <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> are {{not readily}} {{distinguishable}} from the root or among themselves. Several grammatical bits of meaning may be fused into one affix. Morphemes {{may also be}} expressed by internal phonological changes in the root (i.e. morphophonology), such as consonant gradation and vowel gradation, or by suprasegmental features such as stress or tone, which are of course inseparable from the root.|$|R
50|$|Colognian is a {{predominantly}} <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b> It marks its articles, adjectives, nouns, pronouns, {{and more to}} distinguish gender, case, and number.|$|E
50|$|Ho-Chunk is an agglutinating and {{somewhat}} <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b> Verbs contain several affixes to indicate things like person, number, tense, and mood.|$|E
50|$|Typologically, Estonian {{represents}} a transitional form from an agglutinating language to a <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b> The canonical word order is SVO (subject-verb-object).|$|E
5000|$|Non-agglutinative {{synthetic}} <b>languages</b> are <b>fusional</b> languages; morphologically, they combine affixes by [...] "squeezing" [...] them together, drastically changing {{them in the}} process, {{and joining}} several meanings in a single affix (for example, in the Spanish word comí [...] "I ate", the suffix -í carries the meanings of first person, singular number, past tense, indicative mode, active voice.) The term agglutinative is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for synthetic. Used in this way, the term embraces both <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> and inflected languages. The agglutinative and <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> are two ends of a continuum, with various languages falling more toward {{one or the other}} end. For example, Japanese is generally agglutinative, but displays fusion in otōto (younger brother), from oto+hito (originally woto+pito), and in its non-affixing verb conjugations. A synthetic language may use morphological agglutination combined with partial usage of fusional features, for example in its case system (e.g., German, Dutch, and Persian).|$|R
50|$|Agglutinative {{languages}} are often contrasted both with languages in which syntactic structure is expressed solely {{by means of}} word order and auxiliary words (isolating languages) and with languages in which a single affix typically expresses several syntactic categories and a single category may be expressed by several different affixes (as {{is the case in}} inflectional (<b>fusional)</b> <b>languages).</b> However, both <b>fusional</b> and isolating <b>languages</b> may use agglutination in the most-often-used constructs, and use agglutination heavily in certain contexts, such as word derivation. This is the case in English, which has an agglutinated plural marker -(e)s and derived words such as shame·less·ness.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fusional</b> <b>languages</b> {{generally}} tend to {{lose their}} inflection over the centuriessome languages {{much more quickly than}} others. While Proto-Indo-European was fusional, some of its descendants have shifted to a more analytic structure, such as Modern English, Danish and Afrikaans, or agglutinative, such as Persian and Armenian. Other descendants are fusional, including Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Lithuanian, Latvian, Slavic languages, as well as Latin and the Romance languages and certain Germanic languages.|$|R
50|$|Catalan grammar, the {{morphology}} and syntax of the Catalan language, {{is similar}} to the grammar of most other Romance languages. Catalan is a relatively synthetic, <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plains Cree is {{classified}} as a polysynthetic <b>fusional</b> <b>language</b> {{as a result of}} the complexity of its affix combinations. Apart from four personal prefixes, Plains Cree utilizes suffixes exclusively.|$|E
50|$|German is a <b>fusional</b> <b>language</b> with a {{moderate}} degree of inflection, with three grammatical genders; as such, {{there can be}} a large number of words derived from the same root.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusional</b> <b>{{languages}}</b> or inflected {{languages are}} {{a type of}} synthetic languages, distinguished from agglutinative languages by their tendency to use a single inflectional morpheme to denote multiple grammatical, syntactic, or semantic features. For example, the Spanish verb comer ("to eat") has the first-person singular preterite tense form comí ('I ate'); the single suffix -í represents both the features of first-person singular agreement and preterite tense, instead of having a separate affix for each feature.|$|R
50|$|Examples of <b>fusional</b> Indo-European <b>{{languages}}</b> are: Sanskrit, Pashto, Punjabi, Hindustani, Greek (classical and modern), Latin, Italian, French and the Iberian Romance dialect continuum, Irish, Lithuanian, Latvian, German, Faroese, Icelandic, Russian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Albanian {{and many}} Caucasian languages. Another notable group of <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> is the Semitic languages group; however, modern Hebrew {{is much more}} analytic than its classic versions, as are colloquial varieties of Arabic than the standard language, having lost all noun declensions, {{and in many cases}} also featuring simplified conjugation. A high degree of fusion is also found in many Finno-Ugric, Uralic, and Samoyedic languages, like Hungarian, Estonian, Finnish, and the Sami languages, such as Skolt Sami. Unusually for a natively North American language, Navajo is sometimes described as fusional due to its complex and inseparable verb morphology.|$|R
50|$|Analytic, <b>fusional,</b> and agglutinative <b>languages</b> can all {{be found}} in many regions of the world. However, each {{category}} is dominant in some families and regions and essentially nonexistent in others. Analytic languages encompass the Sino-Tibetan family, including Chinese, many languages in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and West Africa, {{and a few of}} the Germanic <b>languages.</b> <b>Fusional</b> <b>languages</b> encompass most of the Indo-European family—for example, French, Russian, and Hindi—as well as the Semitic family and a few members of the Uralic family. Most of the world's languages, however, are agglutinative, including the Turkic, Japonic, and Bantu languages and most families in the Americas, Australia, the Caucasus, and non-Slavic Russia. Constructed languages take a variety of morphological alignments.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese grammar, the {{morphology}} and syntax of the Portuguese language, {{is similar}} to the grammar of most other Romance languages—especially that of Spanish, and even more so to that of Galician. It is a relatively synthetic, <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{not being}} a <b>fusional</b> <b>language,</b> Tlingit is still highly {{synthetic}} as an agglutinating language, and is even polysynthetic to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically incorporating. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.|$|E
50|$|Some {{languages}} shift {{over time}} from agglutinative to fusional. For example, while most Uralic languages are predominantly agglutinative, Estonian is markedly evolving {{in the direction}} of a <b>fusional</b> <b>language.</b> On the other hand, Finnish, its close relative, exhibits fewer fusional traits, thereby keeping closer to the mainstream Uralic type.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, philologists {{devised a}} now classic {{classification}} of languages {{according to their}} morphology. Some languages are isolating, and have little to no morphology; others are agglutinative whose words tend {{to have lots of}} easily separable morphemes; others yet are inflectional or fusional because their inflectional morphemes are [...] "fused" [...] together. That leads to one bound morpheme conveying multiple pieces of information. A standard example of an isolating language is Chinese. An agglutinative language is Turkish. Latin and Greek are prototypical inflectional or <b>fusional</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The theory takes {{paradigms}} as {{a central}} notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word-forms, or to generate word-forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind {{this approach is that}} many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. The examples are usually drawn from <b>fusional</b> <b>languages,</b> where a given [...] "piece" [...] of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, [...] "third person plural." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{different}} languages, word lengths can differ dramatically. Picking up on {{the above}} example, a soccer player in German is translated as a [...] "Fussballspieler", with a length of 15 characters. This example illustrates that English {{is not the most}} efficient language for WC; this study shows an average length for English words in a corpus of over 100,000 words to be 8.93, for Czech to be 10.55 and for German to be 13.24. In addition, in some languages like German called <b>fusional</b> <b>languages</b> as well as agglutinative languages, words can be combined, creating even longer words.|$|R
