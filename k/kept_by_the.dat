5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Austria-Hungary {{established}} a geodetic network, {{for which the}} elevation benchmark {{was determined by the}} Adriatic Sea's average level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste.

5|$|The Pipe rolls {{from the}} 13th century onwards are less {{important}} for historical study {{because there are}} other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.|$|E

According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance}} of bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Alpine spaniels were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{canons of}} the monasteries in the Alps {{in order to}} search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E

5|$|Controversies over shoeing rules, {{concerns}} about soring and the breed industry's {{compliance with the}} Horse Protection Act {{has resulted in the}} development of multiple governing organizations.

The USEF does not currently recognize or sanction any Tennessee Walking Horse shows. In 2013 it also banned the use of action devices and stacks at any time in any class.|$|E

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Official {{attendance}} {{figures for}} league games were not <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> <b>The</b> Football League until 1925. City's official highest average attendance at Valley Parade since then is 18,551 for the 1928–29 promotion season from Division Three (North), although the club reported {{an average of}} 22,585 in 1920–21. It was not until City were promoted to the Premier League in 1999 that the club again recorded average attendances of higher than 18,000. City recorded an average of 18,030 in 1999–2000, and 18,511 the following season.|$|E

In this area today we get the street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting {{the history of the}} land use.|$|E
