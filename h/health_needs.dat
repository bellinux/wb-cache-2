5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual <b>health</b> <b>needs,</b> they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the distribution of healthcare services is according to <b>health</b> <b>need</b> can be achieved under a rather open access system. Methods The 2001 National Health Interview Survey of Taiwan and National Health Insurance claims data were linked in the study. <b>Health</b> <b>need</b> was defined by self-perceived health status. We used Concentration index to measure need-related inequality in healthcare utilization and expenditure. Results People with greater <b>health</b> <b>need</b> received more healthcare services, indicating a pro-need character of healthcare distribution, conforming to the meaning of vertical equity. For outpatient service, subjects with the highest <b>health</b> <b>need</b> had higher proportion of ever use in a year than those who had the least <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and consumed more outpatient visits and expenditures per person per year. Similar patterns were observed for emergency services and hospitalization. The concentration indices of utilization for outpatient, emergency services, and hospitalization suggest that the distribution of utilization was related to <b>health</b> <b>need,</b> whereas the preventive service was less related to need. Conclusions The universal coverage plus healthcare networking system makes it possible for healthcare to be utilized according to need. Taiwan’s experience can serve as a reference for health reform. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Multiple connotations and {{conceptions of}} <b>health</b> <b>need</b> are {{currently}} in use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to specify some important distinctions regarding this confusing multiplicity in a taxonomic fashion relevant to the economic problems that arise in addressing <b>health</b> <b>need.</b> Classification is possible with the relevant concepts in conventional economic theory. The classification applies wherever economic considerations bear upon <b>health</b> <b>need.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Initially, some seminal economic ideas about need are presented from Marshall, Pauly, Banfield, Jevons, Deaton and Meullbauer, and Georgescu-Roegen. Recent discussions of basic needs by Sen and Nussbaum concerning "capabilities" and human flourishing are also considered. Ruger's subsequent developments of these concepts specifically for health are noted. The paper then specifies and classifies the current economic connotations of "health need" by applying positive economic analysis and the framework of economic theory. In particular, the conventional theories of consumer demand and production supply are useful. Geometric tools of analysis along with illustrations from the health sector specify various distinctions and classifications. Findings - The uses of the generic term "need" relate to quite different economic problems. The findings show how diverse interpretations of need can be specified. Originality/value - Distinctions over <b>health</b> <b>need</b> are important since, in many Western countries, need is one of the "pillars" of the Welfare State. Effective policy requires sound conceptions and measurements of need. Given the relevance of economics for approaching competing resource uses in the face of <b>health</b> <b>need,</b> measurement of need is improved with taxonomy, and confusion reduced.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a worksite mindfulness-related multi-component health promotion intervention on work engagement, mental <b>health,</b> <b>need</b> for recovery and mindfulness. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial design, 257 workers of two research institutes participated. The intervention group (n = 129) received a targeted mindfulness-related training, followed by e-coaching. The total duration of the intervention was 6 months. Data on work engagement, mental <b>health,</b> <b>need</b> for recovery and mindfulness were collected using questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 months follow-up. Effects were analyzed using linear mixed effect models.

40|$|As California {{implements}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, it {{is important}} to examine the various types of insurance coverage and their association with mental <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service utilization. Using data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2011 - 2012, this current study compared the mental <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service use of California adults with various insurance types. The findings revealed that respondents' various insurance types were differentially associated with their mental <b>health</b> <b>need</b> and service use. In citing reasons for not seeking treatment, the uninsured {{were more likely to be}} concerned about cost, and the Medicare & Others group was less likely to be concerned about cost than those with Privately Purchased insurance. The Employment-Based insurance group was significantly more likely than the Privately Purchased group to be "concerned about what would happen if someone found out". Further, both the uninsured and the Medicare & Others group were more likely to discontinue treatment compared to their Privately Purchased counterparts. The reasons for discontinuing treatment varied among the different insurance groups. The results suggest that the ACA will improve mental health by reducing concerns about cost reported by the uninsured. However, there is still a need for programs to address other barriers to treatment...|$|R
