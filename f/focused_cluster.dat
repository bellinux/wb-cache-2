This study was an investigation of the vocational rehabilitation case service variables provided through the federal-state vocational rehabilitation system to transition-age consumers with psychiatric disabilities. The identified variables were then studied to determine relationships that exist as they pertain to employment outcomes. The population of vocational rehabilitation consumers was accessed using the Rehabilitation Services Administration 911 database for fiscal year 2007. The database was analyzed using a series of cluster analyses to determine patterns of services associated with competitively employed or unemployment outcomes for this population. A total of 5744 cases were analyzed in this study.

Administration of anti-Thy 1 antibody results in phases of acute mesangial injury (day 2), cell proliferation (day 5), matrix expansion (days 5 and 7), and subsequent healing (day 14). MethodsUsing Affymetrix (RAE 230 A) microarrays coupled with sequential primary biologic function-focused and secondary “baited” global cluster analysis, a cohort of established and putative novel modulators of mesangial cell turnover was identified. ResultsCluster analysis of proliferative genes identified a number of gene expression profiles.

40|$|Abstract The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) remain elusive. Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) {{is a key}} effector cytokine {{in the development of}} lung fibrosis. We used microarray and computational biology strategies to identify genes whose expression is significantly altered in alveolar epithelial cells (A 549) in response to TGF-β 1, IL- 4 and IL- 13 and Epstein Barr virus. A 549 cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml TGF-β 1, IL- 4 and IL- 13 at serial time points. Total RNA was used for hybridisation to Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 A microarrays. Each in vitro time-point was studied in duplicate and an average RMA value computed. Expression data for each time point was compared to control and a signal log ratio of 0. 6 or greater taken to identify significant differential regulation. Using normalised RMA values and unsupervised Average Linkage Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, a list of 312 extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or modulators of matrix turnover was curated via Onto-Compare and Gene-Ontology (GO) databases for baited cluster analysis of ECM associated genes. Interrogation of the dataset using ontological classification <b>focused</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis revealed coordinate differential expression of a large cohort of extracellular matrix associated genes. Of this grouping members of the ADAM (A disintegrin and Metalloproteinase domain containing) family of genes were differentially expressed. ADAM gene expression was also identified in EBV infected A 549 cells as well as IL- 13 and IL- 4 stimulated cells. We probed pathologenomic activities (activation and functional activity) of ADAM 19 and ADAMTS 9 using siRNA and collagen assays. Knockdown of these genes resulted in diminished production of collagen in A 549 cells exposed to TGF-β 1, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in ECM accumulation in IPF. </p...|$|E

Design To attain this objective (1) a geographic information aystem (GIS) is utilized to evaluate the relationships between rates of emergency department (ED) admissions for asthma, race, and socio-economic status at the neighborhood block group level of analysis; (2) cluster statistical analyses are performed using Geomed software; and (3) the asthma risk from industrial air pollution was evaluated with windrose data and Screen 3 air pollution model. Sample Data from five major hospitals with ED admissions of asthma patients (code 493), aged 0 – 15 years, are used to select a region of analysis with good geographical representation based on the catchment areas of hospitals in the study. A total of 2067 of the reported cases between 1 January 1993 and 30 June 1998, are successfully geocoded to a map, generating a no-match rate of 8. 4 %. Data on racial characteristics, population density, and household income levels are obtained from neighborhood block groups in the 1990 census report. Locations of major polluting industries within the study area are obtained from the Toxics Release Inventory. Results Spatial analysis identified a local asthma cluster roughly 2 km east (the predominant downwind direction) of {{the second and third}} largest air polluters (in terms of tonnage) in Wayne County. Evaluation of the industrial pollution with a <b>focused</b> <b>cluster</b> test, Screen 3 air pollution model, and windrose figures, displayed weak association between ED asthma admissions and estimated levels of outdoor air pollution from these two facilities. The neighborhood block groups in the local asthma cluster are more closely correlated with high proportions of African Americans and low median household income. Implications for practice This study illustrates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} GIS in the public health arena. It highlights the difficulty of disentangling the effects of exposure to outdoor air pollutants and socio-economic factors on ED asthmatics (reflecting asthma severity) among an urban population. This study also illustrates the need for population-based, as opposed to hospital-based, asthma data, and the need for block-groups, as opposed to zip codes, as a spatial unit of analysis in the evaluation and analysis of asthma-related risk factors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{literature}} on innovation policy and innovation suggests that cities are becoming {{an increasingly important}} site for innovation. Yet despite this claim, there is relatively little focused academic {{literature on}} local government per se {{and its role in}} developing cluster-related innovation policy. The purpose of this dissertation is to help fill that gap by undertaking an analysis of how cluster-related innovation policy development occurs in the City of Toronto. The analysis focuses as much as possible on cluster-related innovation policy in order to differentiate it from other broader and earlier conceptions of innovation policy. This dissertation makes two main research contributions. First, it offers a more focused critical empirical examination of cluster-related innovation policy development at the municipal government level in Canada through two Toronto cluster case studies, the Toronto Aerospace Cluster and the Toronto Fashion Cluster. The second contribution is the local government-relevant analytical framework that is developed which draws needed analytical attention to the particular interwoven dynamics of three variables involved, as a way of understanding cluster-related innovation policy development within two different kinds of clusters. The primary research question explored is: How have the concepts and practices of cluster-related innovation policy at the local level changed in the City of Toronto roughly in the last twelve years? In order to answer this question three main arguments are advanced and examined. The first argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local government level, though it has the potential for eventual success, and though it is often touted as providing a very effective mechanism for leveraging a cityâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s limited amount of fiscal resources, suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity because it is embedded in a range of other related policies described and promoted in other ways including economic development policy, prosperity policy, competitiveness, and industrial sector policies. The second argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local government level is likely to have only limited efficacy and impacts unless there are explicit sources of multi-level governance financial support and strong multi-level governance coordination. The third argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local level cannot be based on a one size fits all approach given that mega-cities such as Toronto face different challenges of scale and coordination, and given that clusters such as aerospace and fashion exhibit diverse innovation characteristics and coordination and cluster formation challenges. A qualitative research methodology is employed which is built around the analysis of two case studies using both documentary evidence and sources and also confidential interviews. The first technique consists of a systematic exploration of existing documentation from the City of Toronto on their clusters. Federal and provincial documents are also utilized in the case study analysis. The second complementary technique employed consists of semi-structured confidential interviews. These interviews are used for a detailed investigation of participant views of cluster-related innovation policy, and policy processes, during the twelve-year period in the two case studies. The analysis is also placed within historical context through the development of two historical chapters. Two chapters showcase the development of these industries under earlier kinds of industrial, trade and social public policy prior to the case study analysis of each cluster. When the evidence for this first argument is examined, it seems to indicate that cluster-related innovation policy could have provided a very effective mechanism for leveraging the Cityâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s limited amount of fiscal resources but fell well short of doing so, and thus this first argument is borne out empirically. The evidence for the second argument suggests overall {{that the federal government is}} not a <b>focused</b> <b>cluster</b> development player. Moreover, it is not engaged in terms of policy development, or coordinating policy development, among the three levels of government. Instead, the federal government tended to take a business climate approach rather than a <b>focused</b> <b>cluster</b> development approach, which does not help the city or municipality per se. The evidence for the third argument suggests that this argument is borne out broadly speaking. Several of the interviewees indicated that Toronto has to be treated differently when it comes to the development of such cluster policy, given the fact that it has to deal with issues of scale and coordination. And this does not mean just the City of Toronto proper, but also the Greater Toronto Area, the GTA. This is the case because arguably it is only in the major cities that one truly finds all of the necessary critical ingredients that can come together to produce a cluster-related innovation policy. Thus the results of our empirical research clearly indicates that Canadaâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s innovation and related cluster policy architecture is going to have to change if Canada is to live up to its innovation policy and cluster development potential in the 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{a number}} of {{different}} methods for generation of trees and algorithms for phylogenetic analysis in the study of bacterial taxonomy. Genotypic information, such as SSU rRNA gene sequences, now plays a more prominent role in microbial systematics than does phenotypic information. However, the integration of genotypic and phenotypic information for polyphasic studies is necessary for the classification and identification of microbes. Thus, we devised an algorithm that objectively identifies discriminative characteristics for <b>focused</b> <b>clusters</b> on generated trees from a dataset composed of coded data, such as phenotypic information. Moreover, this algorithm has been integrated into the polyphasic analysis software, InforBIO. Results We developed a differential-character-finding algorithm based on information measures and used this algorithm to identify the characteristic that best discriminates operational taxonomic unit clusters. For all characteristics in a dataset, the algorithm estimates commonality in <b>focused</b> <b>clusters</b> and diversity among clusters by scoring based on Shannon's and relative entropies. All the characteristics selected for scoring are equally weighted. Thresholds for the scores are defined to identify discriminative characteristics for clusters efficiently from a database. The unique feature of the algorithm, which is implemented in the InforBIO software, is that it can identify the phenotypic characteristics that discriminate and are associated with the clusters of a phylogenetic tree. We successfully applied this algorithm to the study of phylogenetic clusters of Pseudomonas species. Conclusion The algorithm in the InforBIO software is a novel and useful approach for microbial polyphasic studies. The algorithm can also be applied to diverse cluster analyses. The InforBIO software is available from the download site [URL]. This software is free for personal but not commercial use. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Methods for {{analyzing}} space-time variation in risk in case-control studies typically ignore residential mobility. We develop an approach {{for analyzing}} case-control data for mobile individuals {{and apply it}} to study bladder cancer in 11 counties in southeastern Michigan. At this time data collection is incomplete and no inferences should be drawn – we analyze these data to demonstrate the novel methods. Global, local and <b>focused</b> <b>clustering</b> of residential histories for 219 cases and 437 controls is quantified using time-dependent nearest neighbor relationships. Business address histories for 268 industries that release known or suspected bladder cancer carcinogens are analyzed. A logistic model accounting for smoking, gender, age, race and education specifies the probability of being a case, and is incorporated into the cluster randomization procedures. Sensitivity of clustering to definition of the proximity metric is assessed for 1 to 75 k nearest neighbors. Results Global clustering is partly explained by the covariates but remains statistically significant at 12 of the 14 levels of k considered. After accounting for the covariates 26 Local clusters are found in Lapeer, Ingham, Oakland and Jackson counties, with the clusters in Ingham and Oakland counties appearing in 1950 and persisting to the present. Statistically significant <b>focused</b> <b>clusters</b> are found about the business address histories of 22 industries located in Oakland (19 clusters), Ingham (2) and Jackson (1) counties. Clusters in central and southeastern Oakland County appear in the 1930 's and persist to the present day. Conclusion These methods provide a systematic approach for evaluating a series of increasingly realistic alternative hypotheses regarding the sources of excess risk. So long as selection of cases and controls is population-based and not geographically biased, these tools can provide insights into geographic risk factors that were not specifically assessed in the case-control study design. </p...|$|R
