Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali {{and less likely to}} contain contaminants from the sample's environment.

5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
40|$|Summary. This article {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of natural and artificial <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> on zinc and cadmium toxicity for pea plants (Pisum sativum L.). The research was carried out in water cul-tures on the modified Knopp substrate. Toxic quantities of Zn and Cd were added to the substrate in the form of soluble nitrogen salts. Two natural <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> were prepared from Luvisol and de-graded chernozems. Artificial <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> came from Aldrich company. Different influence of both natural and artificial <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> point out to three mechanisms: (i) difference of cation ex-change capacity and amounts of carboxilic and phenolic groups of all amendments; (ii) chemical properties of zinc and cadmium ions; (iii) ratio between amount of three types of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> and metal contents. <b>Humic</b> <b>acids</b> from Aldrich company were a factor determining zinc and cadmium activity for pea plants. <b>Humic</b> <b>acids</b> from degraded chernozem caused a decrease of cadmium activity of investigated plans.

40|$|I {{analyzed}} Leg 57 sediments organogeochemically and spectroscopically. Organic {{carbon and}} extractable organic matter prevail from the Pliocene to the Miocene. <b>Humic</b> <b>acids</b> occur widely from the Pleistocene {{to the lower}} Miocene and one portion of the Oligocene. The absence of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> in Oligocene and Cretaceous samples suggests that <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> had changed to kerogen. Visible spectroscopic data reveal that <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> in this study have a low degree of condensed aromatic-ring system, which is a feature of anaerobic conditions during deposition, and that chlorophyll derivatives that had at first combined with <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> moved to the solvent- soluble fraction during diagenesis. The elemental compositions of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> show high H/C and O/C ratios, which seem appropriate to a stage before transformation to kerogen. The relation between the linewidths and g-values on the electron spin resonance data indicates that the free radicals in <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> are quite different from those in kerogen. The low spin concentrations of kerogen and the yields of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> up to the lower Miocene demonstrate that organic matter in these sediments is immature.

25|$|A {{limited number}} of bogs have the correct {{conditions}} for preservation of mammalian tissue. Most of these are located in colder climates near bodies of salt water. For example, {{in the area of}} Denmark where the Haraldskær Woman was recovered, salt air from the North Sea blows across the Jutland wetlands and provides an ideal environment for the growth of peat. As new peat replaces the old peat, the older material underneath rots and releases <b>humic</b> <b>acid,</b> also known as bog acid. The bog acids, with pH levels similar to vinegar, conserve the human bodies {{in the same way as}} fruit is preserved by pickling. In addition, peat bogs form in areas lacking drainage and hence are characterized by almost completely anaerobic conditions. This environment, highly acidic and devoid of oxygen, denies the prevalent subsurface aerobic organisms any opportunity to initiate decomposition. Researchers discovered that conservation also required that they place the body in the bog during the winter or early spring when the water temperature is cold—i.e., less than 4°C (40°F). This allows bog acids to saturate the tissues before decay can begin. Bacteria are unable to grow rapidly enough for decomposition at temperatures under 4°C.|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> from soils is laborious and time consuming. Factors {{that affect the}} yield of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> isolated from soils include extraction, fractionation and purification periods.

Modified standard procedures using 0. 1 M KOH were used to isolate <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> from a tropical peat soil. Even though there was a quadratic relationship between extraction period and yield of <b>humic</b> <b>acids,</b> there was no relationship between fractionation period and yield of <b>humic</b> <b>acids.</b> There was negative correlation between the yields of extraction and fractionation periods. This finding enables the {{isolation of}} <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> of Hemists in less than 10 h instead of the existing average period of 48 h, therefore helping in facilitating the idea of producing for instance ammonium-humate or K-humate (N and K foliar organic fertilizers) from peat soils...|$|R

The principle of newly used spectrophotometry method is the preparation of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> solutions in three different media with different pH values. <b>Acid</b> groups of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> are practically completely dissociated in intensely basic environment and the measured absorbance is caused by anion of „humate“.
