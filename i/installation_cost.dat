5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased <b>installation</b> <b>cost</b> of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an <b>installation</b> <b>cost</b> of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

40|$|The uptake {{of solar}} power {{globally}} {{as an important}} alternative energy source to fossil fuels, together with a rapid fall {{in the cost of}} photovoltaic (PV) systems, has been phenomenal during the past decade. This trend is widely anticipated to continue for the years to come. The decline in PV <b>installation</b> <b>costs,</b> like many other new technologies through history, has been largely driven by the learning curve effect. However, it is suggested that other factors, such as costs of key production inputs and prices of competing technologies, also impact the costs of PV systems. In this study, we construct a hierarchical learning curve model to quantify the effects that various factors have on <b>installation</b> <b>costs</b> of PV systems based on empirical data from Taiwan. The results show that, in addition to the learning curve effect as underpinned by an increase of cumulative PV capacity, reductions to silicon price have significantly contributed to the decline of the final <b>installation</b> <b>costs</b> of PV systems in Taiwan. By quantifying the effects of critical cost factors, the learning curve effects on PV <b>installation</b> <b>costs</b> in Taiwan are defined which enable a more accurate projection of PV <b>installation</b> <b>costs</b> for governments, PV producers, operators and users...|$|R
500|$|In recent years, PV {{technology}} has improved its electricity generating efficiency, reduced the <b>installation</b> <b>cost</b> per watt {{as well as}} its energy payback time (EPBT), and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014. Photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power. However, prices for PV systems show strong regional variations, much more than solar cells and panels, which tend to be global commodities. In 2013, utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as China and Germany were significantly lower ($1.40/W) than in the United States ($3.30/W). The IEA explains these discrepancies due to differences in [...] "soft costs", which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and financing costs.|$|E

In addition, there is no competitive market for wind energy, as it does not cost money to get ahold of wind. The main cost of wind turbines are the installation process. The average cost is between $48,000 and $65,000 to install.

[...] An oyster-tecture project has been implemented at Withers Estuary, Withers Swash, South Carolina, by Neil Chambers-led volunteers, at a site where pollution was affecting beach tourism. Currently, for the <b>installation</b> <b>cost</b> of $3000, roughly 4.8 million liters of water are being filtered daily. In New Jersey, however, the Department of Environmental Protection refused to allow oysters as a filtering system in Sandy Hook Bay and the Raritan Bay, citing worries that commercial shellfish growers would be at risk and {{that members of the}} public might disregard warnings and consume tainted oysters. New Jersey Baykeepers responded by changing their strategy for utilizing oysters to clean up the waterway, by partnering with Naval Weapons Station Earle. The Navy station is under 24/7 security and therefore eliminates any poaching and associated human health risk. Oyster-tecture projects have been proposed to protect coastal cities, such as New York, from the threat of rising sea levels due to climate change.|$|E
2500|$|Externally, Columbia was {{the first}} orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High & Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI/LRSI) tiles as its main thermal {{protection}} system (TPS), with white silicone rubber-painted Nomex – known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets – in some areas on the wings, fuselage and payload bay doors. FRSI once covered almost 25% of the orbiter; the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas, and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces. The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) blankets (also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets, or FIBs) {{that had been used}} on Discovery and Atlantis. Originally, Columbia had 32,000 tiles – the upgrade reduced this to 24,300. The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S-Glass fabric on the inside, stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid, then coated with a high-purity silica coating. The blankets were semi-rigid and could be made as large as 30" [...] by 30". Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter. The direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction, improved durability, reduced fabrication and <b>installation</b> <b>cost,</b> and reduced installation schedule time. All of this work was performed during Columbia's first retrofitting and the post-Challenger stand-down.|$|E

40|$|Many {{potential}} {{young farmers}} face the difficult choice between farming or a city career. An important criterion in this decision is the financial distress {{that goes with}} farming. Using data for the 1990 s, the present study compared the financial distress after take-over of family farms by the next generation, in six European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The principles of inheritance and succession and the fiscally appraised value of the farm have a large impact on the transfer price, and therefore on the <b>installation</b> <b>costs.</b> A transfer price below the fiscally appraised value results in gift taxes. The financial distress ratio is a ratio of the yearly interest and rent burden of the <b>installation</b> <b>costs</b> to agricultural income. Besides the <b>installation</b> <b>costs,</b> rent prices and the average interest rate determine {{the differences in the}} ratio among countries. The combination of high transfer prices with a high interest rate, together with the lowest agricultural income of the six countries, resulted in the hardest situation for Danish successors.
