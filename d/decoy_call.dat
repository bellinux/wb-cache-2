40|$|Abstract Background Ab initio protein {{structure}} prediction methods generate numerous structural candidates, which {{are referred to}} as decoys. The decoy with the most number of neighbors of up to a threshold distance is typically identified as the most representative decoy. However, the clustering of decoys needed for this criterion involves computations with runtimes that are at best quadratic in the number of decoys. As a result currently there is no tool that is designed to exactly cluster very large numbers of decoys, thus creating a bottleneck in the analysis. Results Using three strategies aimed at enhancing performance (proximate decoys organization, preliminary screening via lower and upper bounds, outliers filtering) we designed and implemented a software tool for clustering <b>decoys</b> <b>called</b> Calibur. We show empirical results indicating the effectiveness of each of the strategies employed. The strategies are further fine-tuned according to their effectiveness. Calibur demonstrated the ability to scale well with respect to increases in the number of decoys. For a sample size of approximately 30 thousand decoys, Calibur completed the analysis in one third of the time required when the strategies are not used. For practical use Calibur is able to automatically discover from the input decoys a suitable threshold distance for clustering. Several methods for this discovery are implemented in Calibur, where by default a very fast one is used. Using the default method Calibur reported relatively good decoys in our tests. Conclusions Calibur's ability to handle very large protein decoy sets makes it a useful tool for clustering decoys in ab initio {{protein structure}} prediction. As the number of decoys generated in these methods increases, we believe Calibur will come in important for progress in the field. </p...|$|R

Recent research suggests that these additional domains act as integrated decoys recognizing effectors from pathogens. Proteins homologous to integrated decoys are suspected to be effector targets and involved in disease or resistance. Here, we scrutinized 31 entire plant genomes to identify putative integrated decoy domains in NLR proteins using the Interpro search. The involvement of the Zinc Finger-BED type (ZBED) protein containing a putative <b>decoy</b> domain, <b>called</b> BED, in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance was investigated by evaluating susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice over-expression and knock-out mutants. This analysis showed that all plants tested had integrated various atypical protein domains into their NLR proteins (on average 3. 5 % of all NLR proteins). We also demonstrated that modifying the expression of the ZBED gene modified disease susceptibility. This study suggests that integration of decoy domains in NLR immune receptors is widespread and frequent in plants. The integrated decoy model is therefore a powerful concept to identify new proteins involved in disease resistance. Further in-depth examination of additional domains in NLR proteins promises to unravel many new proteins of the plant immune system...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAtypical 7 -transmembrane receptors, often <b>called</b> <b>decoy</b> receptors, act promiscuously as {{molecular}} sinks {{to regulate}} ligand bioavailability and consequently temper the signaling of canonical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways. Loss of mammalian CXCR 7, the most recently described decoy receptor, results in postnatal lethality due to aberrant cardiac development and myocyte hyperplasia. Here, we provide the molecular underpinning for this proliferative phenotype by demonstrating that the dosage and signaling of adrenomedullin (Adm, gene; AM, protein) ‚Äîa mitogenic peptide hormone required for normal cardiovascular development‚Äîis tightly controlled by CXCR 7. To this end, Cxcr 7 ‚àí/‚àí mice exhibit gain-of-function cardiac and lymphatic vascular phenotypes {{that can be}} reversed upon genetic depletion of adrenomedullin ligand.

Lethal techniques have been used for the control of birds considered as pests or can be used in the capture of birds for food.

At the decision phase, choosing the targets versus the competitors elicited stronger anterior insula activation, suggesting that perceptual salience drives heuristic decision making in the decoy effect. Moreover, across participants, activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) predicted a reduced susceptibility to the decoy effect, indicating that resisting the tendency to make heuristic decisions is taxing. Our findings highlight the power of the decoy effect in laboratory settings and document the neural mechanisms underlying the decoy effect...|$|R

Using a good spread of <b>decoys</b> and <b>calling,</b> an experienced waterfowl hunter can successfully bag ducks or geese if waterfowl are flying that day. The first waterfowl decoys were made from vegetation such as cattails by Native Americans. In the 18th century, duck decoys were carved from soft wood such as pine. Many decoys were not painted. Live birds were also used as decoys. They were placed in the water and had a rope and a weight {{at the end of the}} rope so the duck could not swim or fly away. This method of hunting became illegal in the 1930s. By end of the 20th century, collectors started to search for high quality wooden duck decoys that were used by market hunters in the late 19th century or early 20th century. Decoys used in Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Barnegat Bay, and North Carolina's Core Sound, and the famous Outerbanks (OBX) are highly sought after. Most decoys were carved from various types of wood that would withstand the rigors of many seasons of hunting. Highly detailed paint and decoy carvings that even included the outlines of tail or wing feathers turned the duck decoy into a work of art. Today, many collectors search estate sales, auctions, trade shows, or other venues for vintage duck decoys. In the historic Atlantic Flyway, North Carolina's [...] "Core Sound Decoy Festival" [...] draws in excess of 40,000 visitors to the little community of Harker's Island, NC the first weekend in December each year, and Easton, MD with their Wildfowl Festival in the month of November draws a great many people to that old goose hunting community on the Eastern Shore.|$|R

Eastern Egg Rock Island in Muscongus Bay, about [...] away from Pemaquid Point, had been occupied by nesting puffins until 1885, when the birds disappeared because of overhunting. Counting on the fact young puffins usually return to breed on the same island where they fledged, a team of biologists and volunteers translocated 10‚Äì14 days old nestlings from Great Island in Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock. The young were placed into artificial sod burrows, and fed with vitamin-fortified fish daily for about one month. Such yearly translocations took place until 1986, with 954 young puffins being moved in total. Each year before fledging, the young were individually tagged. The first adults returned to the island by 1977. [...] Puffin decoys had been installed on the island to fool the puffins into thinking {{they were part of}} an established colony.

Protein Structure Selection (PSS), instead of reconstructing a 3 D model for the given chain, aims to select among a given, possibly large, number of 3 D structures (<b>called</b> <b>decoys)</b> those that are closer (according to a given notion of distance) to the original (unknown) one.

In this paper we present a completely different approach to PSS which does not take advantage at all of the knowledge of the primary structure of the protein but only relies on the graph theoretic properties of the decoys graphs (vertices represent amino acids and edges represent pairs of amino acids whose euclidean distance is less than or equal to a fixed threshold). Even if our methods only rely on approximate geometric information, experimental results show that some of the graph properties we adopt score similarly to energy-based filtering functions in selecting the best decoys.

40|$|Apoptosis, a {{controlled}} form of cell death, plays {{a central role}} in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Apoptosis induction can occur via intracellular mechanisms, for example after intensive DNA damage, or via triggering of death receptors. Death receptors belong to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Amongst the death receptors, the TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) and its five receptors stand out due to its complexity and tumour-specific killing activity. TRAIL can bind two apoptosis-inducing receptors, TRAIL-R 1 (DR 4) and TRAIL-R 2 (DR 5), two additional cell-bound receptors incapable of transmitting an apoptotic signal, TRAIL-R 3 (LIT, DcR 1) and TRAIL-R 4 (TRUNDD, DcR 2), sometimes also <b>called</b> <b>decoy</b> receptors, and lastly, a soluble receptor called osteoprotegerin (OPG). TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vivo without causing toxicity. On the basis of these findings, specific activation of TRAIL-R 1 and TRAILR 2 is currently evaluated for tumour therapy in early clinical trials. Yet, primary tumours are mostly resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Interestingly however, chemo- and radiotherapy can sensitise primary tumour cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis whereas normal cells remain resistant also to such combinations. To understand the molecular mechanisms of tumour-cell-specific sensitisation to TRAIL, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) was used in an unbiased approach with the aim to identify novel factors involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its inhibition. By screening the TRAIL-sensitive human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa novel modulators of TRAIL signalling were identified. The studies presented in this thesis focus on the identification and validation of factors that are required for TRAIL apoptosis signalling, the molecular characterisation and the determination of their biochemical mechanism of action.

40|$|The {{function}} of a protein {{is closely related to}} the structure it attains. The sequence of a protein is of limited biological relevance without some knowledge of both its structure and its function; protein structures provide a wealth of information that cannot be deduced from their primary sequence alone; therefore, we can get a complete understanding of protein roles by analyzing them in structural terms. Structure-based methodologies are consequently regarded as more robust than sequence-based ones. The limiting step for these structure-based methodologies is actually having the structure of a protein at hand. Due to the ever-increasing gap between known protein sequences and structures and the ever-growing number of protein structure prediction methods available, which {{are becoming more and more}} accurate over time, the use of protein structure models is mandatory. However, and in spite of progress in the field of protein structure prediction, computed models often contain structural inaccuracies in both backbone and side-chain spatial coordinates; instead of being discarded, these models can provide important insights into the {{function of}} the native counterpart; this, in turn, demands the existence of robust methods that can effectively make use of computed models in the midrange and low range of accuracy, routinely produced by proteome-scale protein structure modeling projects. Any structure-based algorithm that does not require high-resolution structures will prove to have a big advantage and an inestimable practical value. ModelDB, the tool introduced here, strives to serve as a resource to test any structure-based method (such as an active site or ligand-binding site predictor) on protein structure models of different quality. This has the final goal of benchmarking the applicability of protein structure models for a given novel algorithm. ModelDB builds sets of models of decreasing quality, which we <b>call</b> <b>decoys,</b> given the sequences experimentally determined proteins. A decoy is a computergenerated protein structure that possesses some characteristics of native proteins, but is not biologically real. Our system is implemented in such a way that any structure-based existing method can be tested on the real structure and on the decoy models. The next step is to automatically assess at which level of quality the results of the tested method differ from those obtained with the native structure. Each decoy model is directly compared to its corresponding native structure and precise quality scores are computed. For a visual insight on how models of different qualities look like and differ from the native counterpart in a spatial context, they are "colored" following different colorschemes defined by the following spatial descriptors: Solvent accessibilities, secondary structures, cavity occurrences, average depths, protrusion indexes or burial indexes. This, in turn, allows an easy visualization and understanding of these parameters' variations in the protein structural context. Besides, functional annotation is provided when available, in terms of catalytic sites, ligand-binding sites and other sites of relevance like glycosylation sites. The tool is publicly available either as an on-line tool or a local application for larger calculations; it makes use of other in-house tools that also exists independently on-line and for local use. One of these tools, mappON, colors input structures according to diverse descriptors and outputs a table with the descriptors of selected residues (and those surrounding them); thus, it serves to analyze properties of key residues in the protein structural context and visually examine the results. The other, MAP, has some features intended to deal with the common problem in bioinformatics of mapping sequence residues onto structures, or structure residues onto another structure. Very few other public resources exist for readily retrieving decoy sets of protein structures, and we indeed have no record of any other automated pipeline for producing such decoys in an easy and user-friendly fashion. Our tool, apart from allowing to build new decoy sets for a given protein a scientist is interested in, covers many more different proteins representing a bigger portion of the protein structural space than any other resource. Furthermore, the on-line version has the advantage to let the user visually inspect and compare all the models of ranging quality for a given protein in the same spatial frame. The decoy sets are conceived to test structure-based methods and define to which extent they can make use of predicted protein structure models. However, the functional documentation, the model quality estimates and the different color schemes allow many large-scale analyses to be performed as well.

40|$|Funding Source: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Total Budget: $ 1000 - $ 5000 per project Project Period: Ongoing Since 1995 In Montana, {{across the}} nation, {{and around the}} world, highway {{construction}} activities often come into direct conflict with migratory and other nesting bird species, frequently resulting in habitat loss, the interruption of breeding and rearing activities, or even mortality. The Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) has considered this issue under the permitting and regulatory guidance {{of state and federal}} authorities, and laws such as the Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. MDT has decidedly taken a proactive approach to avoid or minimize construction related impacts to actively breeding and nesting avian fauna in a conscientious attempt to conserve these feathered species. This paper discusses four case studies in which efforts were made during the design of highway projects to avoid or minimize potential negative effects on avian species by construction activities. Nest relocations, roosting deterrents, temporal and/or spatial restrictions on construction activities, and best management practices have successfully been used in various highway projects in attempts to reconcile human modifications with the natural environment and the avian species that thrive there. An active osprey (Pandion haliaetus) nest atop a through truss bridge located on the Clark Fork River near Alberton in Mineral County of northwestern Montana would have been directly disturbed by proposed bridge rehabilitation activities including, but not limited to, painting of the overhead truss members. Osprey ‚Äúpairbond‚Äù and often return, as adults to breed, to the area in which they were first hatched and fledged as youngsters. Once they construct a nest as a breeding pair, they often return to this same nest site and usually build upon the existing nest structure in successive years. With the concurrence of several state and federal biologists, Mark Traxler, formerly the MDT Missoula District Biologist and currently with Land & Water Consulting, relocated this particular nest in late fall, to an artificial nesting platform erected atop a telephone pole approximately 300 meters downstream from the bridge. The existing native nesting material consisting mainly of sticks, bark, and other detritus, was salvaged and replaced upon the artificial nesting platform. An owl decoy was placed on the bridge truss in order to deter the osprey from returning to the bridge structure to renest the following spring. Upon their return, the nesting pair eagerly took up residency on the new platform and appeared virtually uninterrupted by the rehabilitation activities taking place on the nearby bridge. To date, this nest has been active and has successfully fledged one or more young each season since its relocation in 1997. Temporary measures to deter cliff swallows (Hirundo pyrrhonota) from nesting on a three-span concrete bridge structure have recently been undertaken on the Yellowstone River near Livingston in Park County located in southwest Montana. The scope of this project consisted of bridge rehabilitation including joint work, minor repairs to superstructure, superficial cleaning, and epoxy and concrete sealant applications. Colonies of cliff swallows were observed nesting throughout the entire span of the structure on the outer surface of the bridge beneath the deck along the corbels. After exhaustive contemplation of innovative deterrents such as mesh netting, ribbons, noisemakers and predatory <b>decoys,</b> a product <b>called</b> Bird-X ([URL] com/products/bproof. html) nesting/roosting deterrent (poly-butane) was finally chosen for its ease of application, cost-effectiveness, and potential for removal. This spring, prior to the return of the migratory swallows, MDT personnel scraped off the empty nests and applied this petroleum-based non-toxic caulk. The ICOET 2001 Proceedings 547 A Time for Action gel feels sticky and somewhat greasy to the birds feet, thereby deterring them from colonizing the area. For this application, the product was applied with a pneumatic caulk-gun in the areas from which the nests were scraped off. Bird-X removal solvent was also utilized so that the bird-proofing substance could be removed in the areas of rehabilitation activities, and ultimately removed from the structure altogether {{at the end of the}} construction work. This application proved successful, as the swallows did not attempt to rebuild their nest structures in the areas of application. A few swallows did manage to build nests where the product was not readily applied, but these nests were not in direct conflict with the rehabilitation activities and their nesting appeared uninterrupted throughout construction. After the task was completed, the caulk was completely removed using the solvent, scraping and power washing. The swallows that return here next season will be able to once again colonize the structure. This application accomplished the task of allowing construction activities to go on as scheduled without directly affecting the birds nesting activities during their breeding season. In the future, we look forward to trying the liquid form of Bird-X deterrent for a more even and consistent application and potentially easier removal. A bridge over the Flathead River near Kalispell in Flathead County located in north-central Montana was scheduled for demolition by explosives in early spring of 1995. Discussion between the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and MDT over a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest located approximately one mile from the structure generated a few restrictions on demolition activity and ended in a monitoring agreement. The initial debate centered on the issues of distance from the demolition and whether the noise of the blast would be so disturbing to the adult birds that they would abandon the nest or leave the nest long enough to "freeze" the eggs. Mark Traxler, formerly the MDT Missoula District Biologist, researched the situation and conducted the monitoring of the nest site during and after the demolition. Factors he considered to determine the potential impacts to the birds resulting from the proposed blasting activities were: 1) distance from the disturbance, 2) the topography of the surrounding landscape, 3) buffering from the disturbance by riparian vegetation, 4) duration and severity of the disturbance, and 5) the timing of the disturbance. At approximately one mile, it was determined that the nest was probably far enough away from the structure that relocation would be more disturbing than the blast itself, especially with a nest full of eggs. The landscape is basically flat between the nest and the bridge; the river has a healthy riparian community; the duration of three blasts would last only a matter of seconds, and the severity of the disturbance would decrease as the distance from the structure increased. The USFWS recommended that the blasting only occur on clear (no clouds) days, that the blasting occur between the hours of 1100 and 1600, and that MDT monitor the noise/seismic levels at the nest site. Noise was initially suspected to be the most likely disturbance to the birds. In combination with cloud cover issues and a low ambient temperature, monitoring the situation and the birds' reaction to the blast was critical for the threatened species and for future application in similar situations. In fact, to everyone's surprise, the light-flash of the explosion raised the bird off the nest prior to the "bang" which reached the nest site about seven seconds later. The adult bird circled the nest only once and returned in less than 30 seconds to incubate the eggs. The eaglets successfully fledged the nest that year, and nesting has occurred each year since. In the summer of 1995, during a wildlife survey for the proposed White Sulphur Springs - South project located in Meagher County in central Montana, Kirk Eakin, formerly MDT Butte District Biologist and currently with URS/BRW Incorporated, identified an active ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) nest located approximately 400 feet from the highway and less than 150 feet from the proposed gravel pit and staging area to be used for the construction project. The ferruginous hawk is considered a state species of special concern in Montana and has demonstrated heightened sensitivity to human disturbances. In cooperation with the USFWS and Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (MFWP), temporal and/or spatial timing restrictions on construction activity were avoided through the relocation of the nest site. In the spring of 1996, two alternative nest sites were chosen about one mile away from the highway, but still in the nesting territory of the breeding pair. The original nest material, consisting primarily of sagebrush sticks, was salvaged and used to construct nests on the two artificial nest platforms in an attempt to attract the breeding pair. Mr. Eakin was responsible for monitoring the nesting success of the pair for three seasons following the nest relocation. In 1996, the pair did return to occupy the nesting territory, but no nesting was observed. In the summer of 1997, Mr. Eakin observed the pair incubating eggs in one of the nesting platforms, and two nestlings successfully fledged from the nest during the year of highway construction. Mr. Eakin has continued private monitoring endeavors in the years following his employment with MDT, beginning in 1998 and continuing to date. Between 1998 and 2001, 15 nestlings from this same nest structure have been banded with USFWS leg bands. A ferruginous hawk, banded from this nest site in 1999, was recovered in Lubbock, Texas in January of 2000. Mr. Eakin plans to publish his monitoring results at a later date. While this mitigation allowed proposed construction activities to commence without costly temporal or spatial restrictions, it ultimately provided adequate nesting alternatives for the hawks. When nest relocation or colonization deterrents are not practicable, or the species is too sensitive to human disturbances to risk direct interference, timing and/or spatial restrictions that limit construction activities within a designated radius from the nest site are often recommended. Above-ground utility lines existing within MDT right-of-way and within 300 feet of a waterway are "raptor-proofed" in a variety of ways to prevent raptor perching and nesting activities. Known as MDT Right-of-Way Procedure Memorandum 208, this procedure requires the non-intrusive relocation of an existing nest and the subsequent installation of phalanges, metal rods, or another physical barrier to future perching, nesting, or roosting. These efforts have recently been made standard MDT policy in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations pertaining to endangered species and migratory birds and have already had a positive effect on Montana's raptor population and served to foster cooperative efforts between MDT, USFWS, MFWP, and other resource agencies. In recent years, the Montana Department of Transportation has taken great strides in the implementation of a proactive approach to the conservation of avian species, and other wildlife species that may otherwise be directly affected by highway construction projects. We will continue to experiment with different approaches to avoid and/or minimize negative effects on migratory birds, as well as other wildlife species that share our roadsides. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of these efforts, and embracing the challenges of reconciling human development with the natural environment is part of the ongoing commitment that MDT has to serve the public by providing a transportation system and services that emphasize quality, safety, cost effectiveness, economic vitality and sensitivity to the environment.
