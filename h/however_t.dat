25|$|Buddhist {{practitioners}} in the West are catered {{for by a}} minor industry providing such items as charm boxes, meditation cushions, and ritual implements. This is akin to the various industries providing ritual items and publishing scripture historically, <b>however</b> <b>T.</b> Shakya has criticized this industry as the publication of Buddhist books uproots small forests and consequently kills thousands of insects.|$|E
25|$|Mesrobian {{was then}} {{transferred}} to the Russian front during the winter. The journey to the front was delayed by heavy snow. Thereafter, Mesrobian's battalion {{was transferred to the}} Palestinian and Syrian front to combat Arab forces. In the fall of 1918, during an offensive spearheaded by British forces who were assisted by the Arabs, most members of the 4th Army Corps to which Mesrobian was attached were captured by the Arabs. But Mesrobian managed to flee and was left wandering for several days. While in Palestine, he was ultimately captured by the Arabs and Mesrobian and his unit were then sentenced to death by their Arab hostage-takers. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> E. Lawrence, who is better known as Lawrence of Arabia, {{happened to be in the}} area and was able to intervene and save their lives. Mesrobian was {{then transferred to}} a British encampment in Zagazig, Egypt and was held there as a prisoner of war (POW) from late fall 1918 until his release in May 1919.|$|E
500|$|As minister, Sifton had to {{cope with}} {{increasing}} expenses and with grants from the federal government that did not keep pace. [...] He dealt with this through support for territorial autonomy—the creation of one or more new provinces from the Northwest Territories. [...] Campaigning on this position, he was re-elected in the 1902 territorial election. [...] Months later, <b>however,</b> <b>T.</b> H. Maguire retired as territorial chief justice, and this time Sifton accepted his brother's offer of the position. [...] He resigned his political offices in January 1903.|$|E

5000|$|<b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> Grant of Playlouder {{said the}} song, along with album track [...] "Brainy," [...] {{features}} [...] "some especially overbearing stickwork and neo-sing-a-long choruses that dont really suit" [...] the band.|$|R
50|$|Many long-running CBS {{shows were}} {{canceled}} in 1970-71 because they attracted viewers of an advanced age. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> Mack beat CBS {{to the punch}} and terminated the Original Amateur Hour of his own volition. The final show was broadcast on September 27, 1970.|$|R
500|$|Poe {{describes}} his method in writing [...] "The Raven" [...] {{in the essay}} [...] "The Philosophy of Composition", and {{he claims to have}} strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, <b>however.</b> <b>T.</b> S. Eliot said: [...] "It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method." [...] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as [...] "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".|$|E
2500|$|Wells {{wrote the}} roman à clef, Ann Veronica {{based on his}} {{relationship}} with Reeves. [...] The novel was rejected by his publisher, Frederick Macmillan, because of the possible damage it would do; <b>however,</b> <b>T.</b> Fisher Unwin published it {{in the autumn of}} 1909, when gossip concerning Wells was rampant. Wells later wrote that while the character of Ann Veronica was based on Amber, the character he believed came closest to her was Amanda in his novel The Research Magnificent. On 31 December 1909, she bore a daughter, Anna-Jane, who did not learn that her real father was H. G. Wells until she was 18.|$|E
2500|$|All groups talk a {{particular}} language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It {{is the natural}} way {{of things that you}} say something one way which the lawyer says another way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, to what he calls the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of “the best society,” of “the fashionable”, of “the chic”, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity — T-manners and T-customs etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning [...] "U", he ends the article with [...] "T" [...] stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. <b>However,</b> <b>T</b> and non-T do not seem to have become popular though.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 {{the last}} Bishop of Chekiang, K. H. Ting, lost his diocese when all Anglican and Protestant Christian {{denominations}} were compulsorily merged into the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. <b>However,</b> <b>Ting</b> remained President {{emeritus of the}} China Christian Council {{until his death in}} 2012.|$|R
2500|$|Td is the booster shot {{given to}} {{people over the}} age of seven and {{includes}} the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. <b>However,</b> <b>Td</b> has less of the diphtheria which is why the [...] "d" [...] is lower case and the [...] "T" [...] is capitalized.|$|R
5000|$|Goodbye, My Love - Ted Hollander is in Naples, ostensibly {{looking for}} his niece Sasha, who {{disappeared}} two years before. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> is using the all-expenses-paid trip {{as an excuse to}} visit museums and see art. Set about {{a decade and a half}} in the past, told in the third person from Ted's point of view.|$|R
50|$|Freeze {{allegedly}} chided T. B. Joshua for {{his failure}} to predict the Synagogue Church building collapse. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> B. Joshua has claimed that he foresaw the tragedy which befell his ministry.|$|E
50|$|T. caerulescens is {{very closely}} related to Taphrina deformans, which causes Peach Leaf Curl. These two {{pathogens}} have indistinguishable asci. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> deformans infects peach tree species while T. caerulescens infects Oak tree species only.|$|E
50|$|Tupaia minor is omnivorous; its diet {{includes}} {{insects and}} fruit. Scandentia has little economic significance {{because they do}} little damage to crops or plantations. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> minor may be a seed disperser for several Ficus species.|$|E
50|$|Ted and {{the others}} realize how much he and Zoey argue, a polar {{opposite}} of Lily and Marshall’s relationship, where the two {{always seem to be}} in support of each other. Ted and Lily argue throughout the episode about whose relationship is better. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> begins to feel Lily is right and is growing tired of his constant feuding with Zoey; he is also especially annoyed that Zoey had requested the Arcadian be listed as a landmark, which could scrap his entire project if accepted. When Ted argues again with Zoey about his dream to build a skyscraper in New York, he begins thinking he needs to break up with her. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> realizes he has grown fond of their arguing ("graduation goggles"), and instead kisses her. Future Ted muses on which type of relationship is better, but promptly decides a supportive one is best, a fact his younger self would have to learn the hard way.|$|R
50|$|When Ted gets to {{the museum}} he prepares reasons {{as to why he}} would be a good {{candidate}} to take over the museum for Mr. Bloomsberry who is retiring. Mr. Bloomsberry <b>however,</b> says that <b>Ted</b> is the only candidate because he couldn't imagine leaving not even Junior (the main antagonist from the first film) to own the museum (he is now a cashier at a parking lot). The only stipulation is Ted has to write a presentation on what his vision of what the museum would look like; to be delivered in one week, to the Board of Directors. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> is scared of the Board of Directors.|$|R
500|$|<b>However,</b> <b>Test</b> cricket {{had always}} been fought fiercely, and the {{ruthless}} Bradman {{was not about to}} change this. The Australian skipper repeatedly shut England out of the game with massive totals, relentlessly snuffing out any prospects of an opposition win rather than maximising the chances of an Australian victory with enterprising declarations. On reflection, Miller said [...] "It was inevitable that The Don and I should have clashed. Our temperaments are so different." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> r. nigronuchalis is now {{commonly}} held as full species, i.e., Thamnophis nigronuchalis, whereas {{the status of}} T. r. unilabialis is more ambiguous; most recent molecular evidence suggests it is a full species as well (Thamnophis unilabialis).|$|E
50|$|Trigona fulviventris {{individuals}} {{have been observed}} to abstain from engaging in aggressive behaviors with individuals of other species, particularly larger species like humans. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> fulviventris engages in aggressive behavior with smaller arthropods {{as well as other}} T. fulviventris individuals, particularly those of other colonies, especially during nest initiation.|$|E
50|$|Tynanthus guatemalensis, {{commonly}} known as chib' iyal (Q'eqchi Maya) or ch'ajá xuu' (Yucatec Maya), is a flowering plant species in the genus Tynanthus. It contains the chemical eugenol, the chemical responsible for the cinnamon aroma in the cinnamon plant. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> guatemalensis is not {{closely related to the}} cinnamon plant.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Lily {{tries to}} set up Ted with Shelly, a fellow teacher. When she had {{originally}} tried {{to get them to}} meet, Lily found Ted and Marshall {{in the middle of a}} chicken-finger mouth-stuffing attempt, so she convinced her coworker that <b>Ted</b> wasn't there. <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> is stood up by Shelly; when Lily confronts her, she discovers that Shelly was seduced by an exotic man at MacLaren's. Lily realizes it was Barney and angrily confronts him.|$|R
5000|$|T. celer {{is related}} to Pyrococcus woesei, both {{belonging}} to the order Thermococcales. [...] Both are strictly anaerobic and sulphur reducing. T. celer also shares {{a close relationship with}} Thermococcus litoralis, both belonging to the same genus, <b>however</b> <b>T.</b> celer has shown to be much more sulphur dependent than T. littorals.|$|E
50|$|W. photogenicus {{is often}} {{confused}} with the similarly coloured mimic octopus, Thaumoctopus mimicus. Both T. mimicus and W. photogenicus can have variable activity patterns; <b>however,</b> <b>T.</b> mimicus is most often diurnal, while Wunderpus tends to emerge very slowly from dens in the sand at dusk and dawn and is a crepuscular hunter.|$|E

5000|$|<b>However,</b> <b>Ted,</b> {{who turned}} out to be no better than his morally {{bankrupt}} parents, felt that being married to a murderess wouldn't work in his plan. So, in the sequel, Return to Peyton Place, Selena lived her life as a single woman; continued to work at the Thrifty Corner (she was the store's manager), and did her best to singlehandedly take care of Joey. (Ted had married a snobby blueblood named Jennifer Burbank who eventually killed her mother in-law) ...|$|R
5000|$|The text of Kosovo's {{declaration}} of independence addressed this issue by stating [...] "...Observing that Kosovo is a special case arising from Yugoslavia's non-consensual breakup {{and is not a}} precedent for any other situation, Recalling the years of strife and violence in Kosovo, that disturbed the conscience of all civilized people..." [...] <b>However,</b> <b>Ted</b> Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute stated the view of Kosovo being sui generis and setting no precedent is [...] "extraordinarily naïve".|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with crash dummy {{professor}} Dr. Zub has {{creating a new}} [...] "uncrashable" [...] prototype armor called the Torso 9000 and is testing it {{with the help of}} crash dummy Ted. Unfortunately the initial trial run goes awry and Ted's head is severed from his body. The following night <b>however,</b> <b>Ted</b> is accidentally replaced {{with the head of the}} evil Junkman, who can now harness the power of the Torso 9000 and manages to break free from the Crash Test facility.|$|R
50|$|Some body {{builders}} use T. terrestris extract as a {{dietary supplement}} {{with the belief}} that it increases testosterone levels. The belief was popularized by the American bodybuilder Jeffrey Petermann in the early 1970s. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> terrestris has failed to increase testosterone levels in controlled studies. It has also failed to demonstrate strength-enhancing properties, a finding indicating that the purported anabolic steroid effects of Tribulus terrestris are untrue.|$|E
50|$|Thermonectus zimmermani is {{a species}} of diving beetle native to western Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Morelos. T. zimmermani reaches a total length of 9.5 to 11.3 mm and has {{variable}} bright yellow and black markings {{similar to that of}} T. marmoratus. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> marmoratus has a spotted pattern of yellow circles, T. zimmermani has an irregular, blotched pattern. T. zimmermani head has a V-shaped medial black marking that has been reduced.|$|E
50|$|In {{the normal}} {{life cycle of}} Taenia, {{cysticerci}} develop in {{the muscles of the}} intermediate hosts such as pigs, cows, and sheep. In these animals, they do not cause severe symptoms. They are transmitted to humans when their infected meats are eaten. <b>However,</b> <b>T.</b> solium is unusual because its cysticerci can develop in humans. Due to accidental consumption of the eggs from contaminated foodstuff, cycticerci in human produce clinical symptoms. Thus, humans are accidental intermediate hosts.|$|E
