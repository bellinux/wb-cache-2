50|$|After {{the exit}} <b>tooth</b> <b>locks,</b> the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers a clockwise impulse to the balance wheel's impulse pin via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left banking pin. The escape wheel drops again until the entrance <b>tooth</b> <b>locks</b> on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left banking pin via the lever. The balance wheel continues clockwise, again free from interference until it is pulled back by the balance spring to the center position. The cycle then starts again.|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{discoloration}} {{can cause}} {{social and psychological}} problems and lead to loss of self-confidence in children. Concerns of parents and children on appearance and esthetics increase the importance of dental esthetic treatments in children. <b>External</b> <b>tooth</b> discoloration in children {{can be seen in}} both the primary and the permanent teeth. Poor oral hygiene, use of iron preparations and chromogenic bacteria are among the etiology of <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> discoloration. Chromogenic bacteria can cause black/brown, green, orange or blue discolorations on the tooth surfaces of children. For clinicians, most interesting <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> discoloration in children has been the black discoloration, which is more frequently observed compared to the other types. Most of the studies also have focused on the chromogenic bacteria associated with black discolorations, and the data concerning other types of discoloration are limited. Our knowledge on the existing chromogenic bacterial mechanisms is increasing by the developing microbiological diagnostic procedures, and new species associated with discoloration are becoming recognized. Still, studies dealing with the mechanisms of the chromogenic bacteria leading to discoloration are insufficient in the accessible sources. The objective {{of this article is to}} emphasize the role of the chromogenic bacteria in <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> discoloration in children, to review precautions that can be taken to prevent discoloration, and current treatment methods, and to contribute to the current knowledge of the clinicians on this subject...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{spur gear}} teeth are {{normally}} stronger than pinion {{teeth of the}} same pitch and face width since <b>external</b> <b>teeth</b> are smaller at the base. However, ring gears which are narrower have an unequal addendum or are made of a material with a lower strength {{than that of the}} meshing pinion may be loaded more critically in bending. In this study, a model for the bending strength of an internal gear tooth {{as a function of the}} applied load pressure angle is presented which is based on the inscribed Lewis constant strength parabolic beam. The bending model includes a stress concentration factor and an axial compression term which are extensions of the model for an <b>external</b> gear <b>tooth.</b> The geometry of the Lewis factor determination is presented, the iteration to determine the factor is described, and the bending strength J factor is compared to that of an <b>external</b> gear <b>tooth.</b> This strength model will assist optimal design efforts for unequal addendum gears and gears of mixed materials...|$|R

40|$|The axial {{forming process}} is a method of cold metal forming, which {{is used for the}} {{production}} of axially symmetric profiles and retractions at full and hollow components. Furthermore, the method-sided retractions, material accumulations together with external and internal profiles are produced by incremental forming technology. As an example for <b>external</b> <b>teeth,</b> a strip wounded forming cavity (die) with an alternating kinematic is driven through the work piece and thereby generating the teeth. This specific feature of axial forming is realized by an oscillating tool feed movement. There is no material loss, e. g. gearings can be generated in net-shape-quality by forming operations. In consequence of parallel force reduction, it is also possible to handle thin or slim structures and for instance to equip with an internal or <b>external</b> <b>teeth</b> without causing bending or buckling. A special challenge of the simulative illustration of the process is the connection of the recursive tool kinematic with the friction model.

40|$|The Offset Compound Gear Drive is an in-line, discrete, {{two-speed}} device {{utilizing a}} special offset compound gear that has both an internal tooth configuration on the input end and <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> configuration on the output end, thus {{allowing it to}} mesh in series, simultaneously, with both a smaller <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> input gear and a larger internal tooth output gear. This unique geometry and offset axis permits the compound gear to mesh with the smaller diameter input gear and the larger diameter output gear, {{both of which are}} on the same central, or primary, centerline. This configuration results in a compact in-line reduction gear set consisting of fewer gears and bearings than a conventional planetary gear train. Switching between the two output ratios is accomplished through a main control clutch and sprag. Power flow to the above is transmitted through concentric power paths. Low-speed operation is accomplished in two meshes. For the purpose of illustrating the low-speed output operation, the following example pitch diameters are given. A 5. 0 pitch diameter (PD) input gear to 7. 50 PD (internal tooth) intermediate gear (0. 667 reduction mesh), and a 7. 50 PD (<b>external</b> <b>tooth)</b> intermediate gear to a 10. 00 PD output gear (0. 750 reduction mesh). Note that it is not required that the intermediate gears on the offset axis be of the same diameter. For this example, the resultant low-speed ratio is 2 : 1 (output speed = 0. 500; product of stage one 0. 667 reduction and stage two 0. 750 stage reduction). The design is not restricted to the example pitch diameters, or output ratio. From the output gear, power is transmitted through a hollow drive shaft, which, in turn, drives a sprag during which time the main clutch is disengaged...|$|R

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} <b>external</b> <b>teeth</b> machined into that ring gear. From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same ring gear in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the <b>external</b> <b>teeth</b> if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit ring gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper aims at {{exposing the}} {{foundations}} or reasons why, {{in cases of}} <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> resorption, including those of orthodontic origin, one should not perform a root canal to treat it. That should be done only to teeth with contamination or pulp necrosis, to remove the periapical inflammation induced by microbial products. When facing cases of <b>external</b> <b>tooth</b> resorption, one's conduct must always respect the following sequence of steps: first of all, identifying the cause accurately; then, planning the therapeutic approach and, finally, adopting the conducts in a very well-founded way. The situations in which endodontic treatment is recommended for tooth resorptions are those when there are: a) pulp necrosis with microbial contamination, b) aseptic pulp necrosis, c) developing calcific metamorphosis of the pulp and d) diagnosis of internal resorption. It is not possible, through the pulp, to control the resorption process that {{is taking place in}} the external part, after all, the causes are acting in the periodontal ligament. There is no evidence that justifies applying endodontic treatment, by means of root canal, to control external resorption processes, when the pulp shows vitality...|$|R
