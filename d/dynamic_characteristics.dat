40|$|AbstractA cyclic {{symmetry}} {{analysis method}} is proposed for analyzing the <b>dynamic</b> <b>characteristic</b> problems of thin walled integral impeller. Reliability and feasibility {{of the present}} method are investigated by means of simulation and experiment. The fundamental cyclic symmetry equations and the solutions of these equations are derived for the cyclic symmetry structure. The computational efficiency analysis between whole and part is performed. Comparison of results obtained by the finite element analysis (FEA) and experiment shows that the local <b>dynamic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of integral impeller has consistency with the single cyclic symmetry blade. When the integral impeller is constrained and the thin walled blade becomes a concerned object in analysis, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of integral impeller can {{be replaced by the}} cyclic symmetry blade approximately. Hence, a cyclic symmetry analysis method is effectively used to improve efficiency and obtain more information of parameters for <b>dynamic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of integral impellers...|$|R

Shear wave velocity measurement and standard penetration test are generally expensive and are not feasible to be carried out at large number of sites for the purpose of microzonation.

Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for microzonation.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure {{if it is to}} be a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code.
