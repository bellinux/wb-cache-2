40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess changes in the {{anaerobic}} threshold of young soccer players in an annual training cycle. A group of highly trained 15 - 18 year old players of KKS Lech Poznań were tested. The tests included an annual training macrocycle, and its individual stages resulted from the time structure of the sports training. In order to assess the level of exercise capacities of the players, a field exercise <b>test</b> <b>of</b> increasing intensity was carried out on a soccer pitch. The test made it possible to determine the 4 millimolar lactate threshold (T LA 4 mmol[*]·[*]l- 1) on the basis of the lactate concentration in blood [LA], to establish the threshold running speed and the threshold heart rate [HR]. The threshold running speed at the level of the 4 millimolar lactate threshold was established using the two-point form of the equation of a straight line. The obtained indicators of the threshold running speed allowed for precise establishment of effort intensity used in individual training in developing aerobic endurance. In order to <b>test</b> the significance <b>of</b> differences in mean values between four <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> a non-parametric Friedman ANOVA test was used. The significance of differences between consecutive <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> was determined using a post-hoc Friedman ANOVA test.

30|$|A {{total of}} 1000 young male rugby players {{involved}} in playing 15 -a-side rugby from {{a population of}} 4442 (age 9 – 14  years) located in the Provence-Côte d’Azur rugby county (France) were included in a cross-sectional study conducted between September 2012 and May 2013. From these children, 738 volunteered {{to participate in the}} study and all the players were attached to clubs. Informed consent was obtained from child and parent or legal guardian prior to each child’s participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Toulon and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The young rugby players were divided into three groups according to age categories set by the French Rugby Federation: under 11  years (U 11; 10.0 [*]±[*] 0.6  years, n[*]=[*] 247), under 13  years (U 13; 12.1 [*]±[*] 0.5  years, n[*]=[*] 261), and under 15  years (U 15; 14.0 [*]±[*] 0.5  years, n[*]=[*] 230).

40|$|Objectives: This study {{asked the}} {{following}} questions: 1) Does HIV testing in pregnancy identify women who previously were {{not known to}} be HIV positive? 2) When in pregnancy are women identified as HIV infected? 3) Does HIV seroconversion occur during the prenatal care period? Methods: Medical records of 97 women from two primarily indigent care hospitals in Houston, TX who {{were found to be}} HIV positive at delivery were reviewed to determine if they had tested positive during the prenatal care period. Demographics and time of gestation of the prenatal testing also were recorded. The outcome measures were: 1) number of women found positive during prenatal care; 2) week of gestation at discovery of HIV positivity; and 3) number of women seroconverting between the initiation of prenatal care and delivery. Results: Thirty women were known to be HIV positive prior to pregnancy. Fifty-six women were found to be positive during prenatal care and the seropositivity of 44 was discovered before the 34 th week of pregnancy. Ten women were found to be positive at their first prenatal visit, which occurred after the 34 th week. <b>Date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> was unknown for two women. Eleven women who received no prenatal care were found to be HIV positive at delivery. There were no seroconversions while women were under prenatal care. Conclusions: HIV testing at delivery did not find any HIV-positive women who had tested negative during prenatal care. Testing is very important for women who do not receive prenatal care.

40|$|According to {{analyses}} by the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), geothermal {{electric power}} capacity could nearly quadruple {{over the next}} 20 years, {{and there is a}} tremendous potential for growth in the direct uses of geothermal energy. However, for a high rate of development to occur in either of these applications, the identified resource base must be expanded. To this end, the Department is supporting R&D efforts to 1) share with industry the costs and risks of evaluating promising new resource prospects with power potential; 2) reduce the costs of exploration to enhance industry’s cost-competitive posture; and 3) assess the location and characteristics of low-temperature resources. This paper describes DOE’s new cost-shared industry-coupled exploratory drilling program to be initiated with a solicitation by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, field manager of DOE’s reservoir technology activities. Proposals will be requested for drilling either core holes or full-size wells on prospects from which some information had already been gathered, such as surface geophysics or shallow heat flow. The paper also discusses the status of the project designed to demonstrate whether a geothermal reservoir can be identified and adequately evaluated to meet investment requirements with slimholes rather than the much more costly production-size wells. Results to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> at the Far West 24 MWe plant site at Steam Boat Hills, Nevada, are reported, and plans for related technology development to make slimhole exploration accessible even to small developers are described. In addition, the paper describes the components of a Low-Temperature Assessment Program and its objectives and identifies the state resource assessment teams. It is concluded that the successful execution of each of these projects will help to ensure a secure future for geothermal energy in this country, thus enhancing the environment wherever geothermal energy substitutes for the combustion of fossil fuels...|$|E
40|$|A {{microcomputer}} {{program called}} CADENZA, which employs Bayes' theorem {{to analyze and}} report the results of various clinical descriptors and noninvasive tests relative to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, was evaluated in 1, 097 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction. With this program, each patient was characterized by a probability for coronary artery disease, based on Framingham risk factor analysis, symptom characterization, electrocardiographic stress testing, cardiokymography, cardiac fluoroscopy, thallium perfusion scintigraphy and technetium equilibrium-gated blood pool scintigraphy. A total of 11, 808 probability estimates derived from various combinations of the available observations were analyzed: 2, 180 in 170 patients undergoing coronary angiography and 9, 628 in 969 patients who completed a 1 year follow-up for coronary events. The predicted probability of disease correlated linearly with observed angiographic prevalence in the 170 patients who subsequently had coronary angiography (prevalence = [0. 001 ± 0. 011] + [0. 966 ± 0. 019] x probability). The difference between probability and prevalence averaged 3. 1 %, and {{the magnitude of this}} correlation was not affected by the type or amount of data analyzed. The prevalence of multivessel disease in these patients increased as a monotonic function of disease probability. Below a probability of 25 %, single vessel disease was slightly more common than multivessel disease. Above a probability of 75 %, multivessel disease predominated. In the 969 patients followed up for 1 year from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> the incidence of cardiac death and nonfatal infarction increased as a cubic function of disease probability (from approximately 0 to 8 % per year for each). Above a probability of 90 %, however, the standard deviation for predicting these events was wide. These data indicate that Bayes' theorem in general— and CADENZA in particular—is an accurate, clinically applicable means for quantifying the prevalence of angiographic coronary artery disease, the risk of multivessel disease and the incidence of morbid coronary events in the year after testing...|$|E
30|$|Measuring the {{prevalence}} of MRSA by the ratio of patient-hours by patients that has tested positive with MRSA at the unit to the total patient hours at the unit, we conclude {{that there was a}} weak tendency for heightened prevalence for units of intermediate centrality. We also noted that the various centrality measures gave qualitatively similar results. Even though in most network models and empirical networks various centrality measures are usually positively correlated, some types of regularities can cause them to be less so, our unit network did not show any such effects. In sum, even though the healthcare system is hierarchically organized, the patient flow in our dataset is rather random. This makes the unit network inefficient in predicting units of increased MRSA prevalence. Another reason for the weak correlations is that Sweden in general [24], and this data set in particular, has a low MRSA prevalence. This suggests that most cases are community acquired (Ref. [24] argues that most Swedish MRSA cases are infected abroad). On the other hand, {{around the time of the}} test, the MRSA carriers show a rather clear tendency to move to units that are more peripheral. Another trend we observed was that {{the prevalence}}s of the different types were correlated with the centrality of the unit where the patient tested positive. This correlation was strongest when the turnover of patients was used as a (dynamic) measure of centrality. We also found that patients have an exponentially increasing probability to be present in the healthcare before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> positive, and a decreasing probability afterwards. These probabilities are asymmetric in time with a larger chance of being present in the health care system after the test date. The increasing presence before the test date suggests most of the contagion has occurred within the healthcare system. The increasing presence after the test date indicates that the patients’ hospitalization is related to the MRSA infection.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the usefulness of the}} variables level of interpersonal maturity and personality style to predict response to treatment in a residential facility for adjudicated delinquent males. The study examined whether adolescent delinquent males would respond differently to an intervention model which employs a peer-normative culture as the core of its program. ^ Sixty adolescent adjudicated delinquent males ranging in age from 14 to 18 years were administered three questionnaires and the Metropolitan Achievement Test on admission to the program. These consisted of two personality inventories, the Jesness Inventory (Jesness 1969) and the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (Millon, Green, and Measher, 1977), and a measure of delinquent behavior, the Jesness Behavior Checklist (Jesness, 1970). Three of these instruments, the achievement tests, the Behavior Checklist, the Millon Personality Inventory were readministered in six months from the original <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> ^ T-tests were performed to determine whether there were any differences between subjects who completed six months of the program, and those who did not. Results of this analysis reveal that personality variables were unable to discriminate between these two groups. No other variables were identified which were able to account for which subjects who sustained participation in the program. ^ Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted on staff ratings of the residents 2 ̆ 7 behavior for the final four weeks of the six month period. Results of this analysis indicated that one variable, the Introversive Scale of the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory, was able to predict positive staff ratings. No other variables were significant for this measure of treatment outcome. ^ Two instruments were employed to measure the subjects 2 ̆ 7 perception of their delinquent behavior, the Behavior Checklist and the Millon Inventory. Regression analyses were performed to determine if the independent variables were able to predict change in delinquent behavior as measured by these instruments. A review of the regression analyses using the personality scales of the Millon and the Jesness as the predictive variables suggests that when subjects at I-Level III and IV are analyzed separately, the overall strength of the results increases markedly. I-Level alone did not prove to be a significant predictive variable for any of the outcome measures. It did enhance the strength personality style as a predictive variable. The Jesness was able to predict behavior change better for the higher level subjects. ^ The residential program appeared to be designed to treat the more conformist-oriented I-Level III subjects better than the more mature subjects. Future research should focus on testing differential treatment outcome in a different type of treatment program, and on long term follow-up studies. ...|$|E
40|$|In practice, {{concrete}} {{is initially}} tested for compressive strength by casting a cube/cylinder, which {{is left to}} cure in favourable conditions until the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> The results obtained from such tests can give a consultant guidance on the material's properties such as estimated porosity, density and compressive strength. These tests are known as control and conformity tests. Supplementary tests may be needed if the control test fails or further investigation {{must be done to}} the concrete. These tests are done by drilling core specimens out of the in-situ concrete and applying the necessary tests. These results are used to verify conformity with specifications set out by the engineer. The outcome of such a test is extremely important as it is often used as the basis to decide the integrity of the structure. Although important, in-situ compressive strength remains as one of the least understood concrete properties due to the difficulty in relating and interpreting the results. Furthermore, there is no reliable universal relationship between compressive strength of cores and; moulded cubes and cylinders. A comprehensive literature and experimental study was attempted to relate standard cube and core compressive strength, as well as, cylinder and core strengths to identify the factors that may affect the analysis and interpretation of results. An experimental program was set out to relate the compressive strength of cubes, cores and cylinders, with a length/diameter ratio of 1. 0. All specimens were cast, cured, prepared and tested in the University of Cape Town, New Engineering Building (NEB) laboratory according to South African National Standards. Twelve concrete mixes were designed using two concrete strengths (30 and 50 MPa), three maximum aggregate sizes (9. 2, 19. 2 and 26. 5 mm) and two aggregate types, namely greywacke and quartzitic sandstone. An additional two mixes of high strength concrete were created (60 and 75 MPa) using 19. 2 mm greywacke aggregate. The compressive tests involved a 100 mm cube, three diameter cylinders (70, 100 and 150 mm) and four core diameter sizes (50, 70, 100 and 150 mm). All core specimens were drilled from beams that were cast. A total of 520 specimens were tested during this study. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to all the results to identify if the compressive strengths were statistically significantly different. The compressive strength and statistical results indicate that 100 mm cubes and 100 mm diameter cores have statistically similar compressive strengths. The diameter of the core and cylinder influenced the compressive strength. It was found, as the diameter size decreased the strength increased for core specimens and the opposite was found for the cylinder. Both findings were inconsistent with literature. However, as the core and cylinder diameters increased to a size larger than 100 mm, the compressive strengths were statistically similar. With respect to the maximum aggregate size, the strength was influenced in correspondence with the diameter size. As the core diameter decreased and the maximum aggregate size increased, the compressive strength increased. Whereas, the opposite was found with the cylinders. The strength level further determined the influence that the coarse aggregate type had on the compressive strength. At the 30 MPa strength level, the aggregate types produced statistically similar strength. At the 50 MPa strength level, the sandstone produced a statistically higher compressive strength compared to the greywacke aggregate. Finally, as the strength level increased over 50 MPa {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean compressive strength of cubes and cores. It was concluded, owing to the controlled environment that the all specimens were cast, cured, prepared and tested; as well as the similarity in the geometric size, statistically comparable compressive strengths were obtained for cubes and cores...|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{measurements}} of skid resistance {{were made on}} 20 pavements in common use in Kentucky. Tests were conducted from November 1969 through 1973. Principal analysis involved relating changes in skid resistance to {{day of the year}} and relating skid resistance to temperature at the time <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> to average antecedent temperatures, and to average rainfall. Seasonal variations exhibited an annual sinusoidal cycle. The changes in sand-asphalt and bituminous concrete surfaces under higher volumes of traffic were about 12 skid numbers. The changes in portland cement concrete and bituminous concrete under lower volumes of traffic were about 5 skid numbers. The lowest skid numbers (SN's) occurred in early to mid-August for portland cement concrete and sand-asphalt pavements and in late August to early September for bituminous concrete. Correlations between changes in SN and temperature were best for ambient air temperature averaged over 4 - and 8 -week periods prior to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>test.</b> However, correlations between changes in SN and temperature were not as good as correlations between SN and day of the year. On the other hand, combining traffic volumes in the form of deviations from yearly average daily traffic with temperature yielded correlations with SN's which were as good as correlations between SN's and the day of the year.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess and compare the levels of aerobic {{performance}} of young football players in various periods of an annual training macrocycle. The study covered a group of fifteen 14 - 15 -year-old football players of KKS Lech Poznań S. A. The study was carried out on five dates in key moments of the time frame of the annual training cycle (the beginning and the end of the basic preparatory period, the end of the spring round of the starting period and the beginning and the end of the autumn round of the starting period). In order to establish the level of aerobic performance the subjects performed an exercise test with increasing intensity on a Woodway treadmill with a 5 % elevation. The initial speed of the treadmill belt was 8 km•h- 1 and was increased every three minutes by 2 km•h- 1 until exhaustion. During the exercise test the following physiological indicators were recorded on an ongoing basis using the Cardio Pulmonary Exercise computer system (Medical Graphics Corporation, USA) : •VO 2, •VO 2 •kg- 1, VE, •VO 2 •HR- 1, RQ, as well as the running speed (V) and the distance covered.
