50|$|Dunstall Castle was {{constructed}} in 1766-1767, and resembles a ruined castle. It was designed by either Sanderson Miller, or Robert Adam as an <b>eye</b> <b>catcher,</b> and it is located on Dunstall Common, Earls Croome. In 2009 the stonework was in bad condition, and essential repairs were under way. It is Grade II* listed. It was purchased by the National Trust in 2009, and restoration of it was funded {{by a grant from}} Natural England.|$|E

For the 5000th show the locomotive was again lent to the Starlight Express Theatre to stay there with an old coach for three years. However, the locomotive has not been transported back and is still displayed in front of the theater.|$|E

He thought that two [...] "Ks" [...] in Carl's name would be an <b>eye</b> <b>catcher.</b> In January and February 1964, he booked the group to play {{six days a week}} in [...] "Nights at the Comedy", a variety show which he devised and staged at The Comedy Theatre in London's West End. Around early 1964 they recorded two singles for Decca Records which were never released.|$|E
40|$|In ball games, one cannot direct ones gaze at {{the ball}} {{all the time because}} one must also judge other aspects of the game, such as other players' positions. We wanted to know whether there are times at which obtaining {{information}} about the ball is particularly beneficial for catching it. We recently found that people could catch successfully if they saw any part of the ball's flight except the very end, when sensory-motor delays make it impossible to use new information. Nevertheless, there may be a preferred time to see the ball. We examined when six catchers would choose to look at the ball if they had to both catch the ball and find {{out what to do with}} it while the ball was approaching. A catcher and a thrower continuously threw a ball back and forth. We recorded their hand movements, the <b>catcher's</b> <b>eye</b> movements, and the ball's path. While the ball was approaching the catcher, information was provided on a screen about how the catcher should throw the ball back to the thrower (its peak height). This information disappeared just before the catcher caught the ball. Initially there was a slight tendency to look at the ball before looking at the screen but, later, most catchers tended to look at the screen before looking at the ball. Rather than being particularly eager to see the ball at a certain time, people appear to adjust their eye movements to the combined requirements of the task...|$|R
50|$|The building's {{prominent}} {{location on}} the river front also served as an attraction of new customers. It was seen from long distances, even from across the East River. As the Sohmers were producing product for popular consumption {{it was important that}} his factory was seen by as many people as possible, thus this location served not only as a display for inhabitants of Manhattan, but also those who passed by on the boats. The building served excellent as an <b>eye</b> <b>catcher</b> because of its scale and proportions. But the most focal point of the building of course remained the clock tower elevating above the 2 wings of the factory. This clock tower remains the most significant feature of the building. It is also most elaborately decorated part of the building. Mansard roof with curved dome is covered with decorations expressing this as the most focal part of the building. From the corner side the building was seen the best thus architects have chosen to express this part of it the most. For factories usually most decorated parts were entrances and clock towers.|$|E

Many values identified during the [...] "Cultural Heritage" [...] State Program constitute the invaluable fund of the National Museum of Kazakhstan.The museum building is an <b>eye</b> <b>catcher</b> with its unusual external form. The largest unique museum complex has an area of 74,000 sq.m. and consists of seven blocks with a variable number of storeys to the ninth floor. Exhibit space occupies 14 rooms with a total area of over 14,000 sq.m.The National Museum of Kazakhstan is composed of the following halls: Hall of Astana, Hall of Independent Kazakhstan, Hall of Gold, Hall of Ancient and Medieval History, the Hall of History, Ethnography Hall, Halls of Modern Art. The structure of the museum on studying the national heritage is represented by the Research Institute. There are also facilities for a children's museum, children's art centre, two showrooms, restoration workshops, laboratories, professional depositories, a scientific library with a reading room, a conference hall and souvenir stalls.The museum is fitted out with equipment of international standard, one uses modern exhibition technology for expositions: a unique curved screen with a special content, working for two halls, a media floor, a dynamic layout of the central part of modern Astana, numerous media outlets, holograms, LED-technology, touch-sensitive kiosks, and a multimedia guide providing information in three languages.|$|E
40|$|Beads {{were often}} {{neglected}} in archeological considerations, investigated in an unsatisfactory way, used as <b>eye</b> <b>catcher</b> for publications and reduced to their esthetic value. In fact {{they are an}} essential and inseparable part of Neolithic life, requiring complex concepts. They are linked to technology, exchange, ritual and esthetic. Tell Sabi Ayad yielded beads from the Late Neolithic only, which facilitates a case study focused on this restricted period. A {{large part of the}} beads is not directly datable, as many bead types and materials are diachronic, used in the Late Neolithic and Late Bronze Age. So the beads are dated according the levels where they were found. The excavations on Tell Sabi Ayad were subdivided in 5 operations, all with an own stratigraphy. Operation III was excavated over the largest surface area and most levels could be C 14 dated. Only this operation allowed statistical considerations. It turned out that bead rates, diversity of types and colors did not increase with time, but in certain periods only. Raw materials, unfinished and reused beads in association with possible tools are rare on the tell. However this evidence and the amount of local stones suggest production on household level on the tell. Partly beads are fractured, but there are no indications for intentional fragmentation. On the contrary it seems that in grave context only pristine pieces of jewelry were deposited, but jewelry is not mandatory in burials. There are large differences regarding amount and quality of beads in the graves. These differences might indicate some kind of stratification within the society. The major portions of beads are single, complete beads. Necklaces, bracelets and anklets were found in much lesser quantities and mainly in grave context. The beads are all stored in depots in Syria and could not be studied directly. Therefore my study is based on the documentations produced in the field, and Neolithic bead technology is discussed in general. Generally investigations on beads are focused on technological or social aspects but do not work out the variations between Early and Late Neolithic stone beads. It remains challenging to investigate how beads changed with the onset of the Late Neolithic in a semi sedentary society. ...|$|E
