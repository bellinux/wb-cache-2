2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> {{a large group of}} people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy?" [...] said Rose; [...] "she {{will come}} in a moment. She is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the dish you {{especially}} ordered, and which Deborah wonders at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'd better sit up {{and keep}} the fire going," [...] he replied, heroically. [...] "There's a big log out there that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> to roll up on the {{windward}} side." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked up}} at him eagerly. [...] "Now tell me," [...] she asked, [...] "would he have written that if he hadn't {{something}}--jewels, or estate, or something of that sort, which he knew was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>in</b> money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} about that, but I {{certainly}} mean to try. There will be lots of opportunities about the new Reform Bill. Of course you know that Mr. Mildmay is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>in</b> at once. You hear all that from Mr. Kennedy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you think?" [...] said Cherry, who had {{received}} her note {{in the midst of}} one of the family conferences; [...] "Augusta said that Mrs. Butler Cornbury would not like to meet Rachel Ray; but she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her <b>in</b> her own carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dare say; but I shouldn't {{have wanted}} them if I {{thought it was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> all this bother and trouble, and make me have to look over old accounts, and all such things. I'd rather never have had any thing!" [...] And here Lillie began to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Scenery's not my department; I {{always need}} a human interest. You know I'm deeply human, Isabel; I always was," [...] Miss Stackpole rejoined. [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> your cousin--the alienated American. There's a great demand just {{now for the}} alienated American, and your cousin's a {{beautiful}} specimen. I should have handled him severely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Wyandots and the Ottawas {{are very}} {{angry at the}} Wanderers," [...] said the hunter who {{furnished}} the news. [...] "They say the Wanderers must hereafter keep to the hunting grounds in the far west. The Wyandots say there was some mistake made about Dave, and they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in,</b> next spring, the goods they got away from Bevoir, and which were stolen from the pack-train." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Baltimore Sun {{reported}} that former Battalion 3-16 member Jose Barrera {{said he was}} taught interrogation methods by U.S. instructors in 1983: [...] "The first thing we would say is that we know your mother, your younger brother. And better you cooperate, because if you don't, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them <b>in</b> and rape them and torture them and kill them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{wait till}} we {{get down to}} business. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down {{everything}} <b>in</b> sight," [...] went on Ham Spink. He could hardly talk without [...] "blowing his own horn," [...] {{as some of the}} boys put it.|$|R
5000|$|On September 3, 2008, Mellencamp made {{available}} on his website a home-video recording of his solo acoustic cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "The Times They Are A-Changin'" [...] {{as a sign}} that the 2008 Presidential Election was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about change <b>in</b> America.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious!" [...] she said, [...] "I'm {{a perfect}} fright! You must excuse me," [...] she added, looking round toward me, [...] "for {{being in this}} state. I'd just slipped on this old fur blouse and run around to a neighbour's and I'd no {{idea that he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> company. Just like him! I'm afraid we've nothing but a plain {{alligator}} stew to offer you, but I'm sure if you'll stay to dinner--" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{everyone}} was asleep, Mohammed said softly to his wife: 'Maiden, I have {{got such a}} clever plan! I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the mare and put it at your feet, and I will cut you, just a few little flesh wounds, so {{that you may be}} covered with blood, and everybody will suppose you to be dead. But remember that you must not make a sound, or we shall both be lost.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Little Pet Werewolf: After last year's abysmal Pet Day, Skip has {{sworn to}} bring in a cool new pet instead of his lame dog, Lupe. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a werewolf, of course he's not {{going to have to look}} far...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mother; I did {{not start}} until half-past one, and so I got a good six hours before I turned out. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help Uncle Ben put {{a fresh coat of}} pitch on our boat. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her <b>in</b> as soon as there is water enough. Tom stopped on board with him, but they let me come ashore in Atkins' boat; and of course I lent them a hand to get their fish up. We shall land our lot when the bawley comes up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As much cry as {{the other}} fellows," [...] said Mr Tadpole; [...] "but no one of course would think of {{dissolution}} before the next registration. No, no; {{this is a very}} manageable Parliament, depend upon it. The malcontent radicals who have turned them out are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them <b>in.</b> That makes us equal. Then we have an important section to work upon--the Sneaks, the men who are afraid of a dissolution. I will be bound we make a good working conservative majority of five-and-twenty out of the sneaks." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wilson's take on <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> Budig as Greenlee {{hinged on}} her {{belief that it}} was a no-brainer. Wilson had been trying to get Budig at All My Children for years. [...] "She went on to Guiding Light about two weeks before I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her <b>in</b> <b>to</b> read for the part," [...] stated Wilson. [...] "Since then I'd spoken to her several times and tried to {{encourage}} her to come here, and this time we got lucky. I think she's a terrific young lady and a wonderful actress, and I'm really happy that we have her here at ABC." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time wrote [...] "Walker {{is equally}} inept at theology, as this album's title track fails to {{help explain why}} bad things happen to good people, and [...] "Jesus Was A Country Boy" [...] isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> any new converts." [...] Cheryl Harvey Hill of Country Stars Online wrote that the song has [...] "A very {{powerful}} old message is conveyed in a melodic, refreshing, new way." ...|$|E
50|$|Savvidis {{agreed to}} return to Omonia after Dragomir Okuka was sacked after failing to improve Omonia's {{fortunes}}. Omonia's fans were keen to see what effect this change was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the club's bewildering fortunes and had hoped {{that one of the}} club's long-time servants had what it takes to lift them to the top once again. However, Savvidis failed to change the club's performances and after only four months on the job quit, citing pressure from the Omonia fans.|$|E
50|$|Having had enough, {{the board}} of {{trustees}} tell Principal McGree that he is a failure as a disciplinarian, and that he is incapable of handling the school by himself. They tell him they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> someone new. The next day, an all black BMW seeping smoke from the insides arrives {{in the parking lot of}} the high school, and out steps a figure wearing a suit. Jesse, meanwhile, makes an encounter with Rita, a substitute teacher filling in for Mrs. Poindexter, the music teacher. After being chastised and asked to correct his behavior, Jesse becomes smitten with her.|$|E
60|$|If any {{one here}} loves me, she has my sincere thanks. Nay, {{if any one}} here is so good as to love me--why, I'll be a brother to her. She shall have my sincere, warm, unsullied affection. When I was {{coming up in the}} car with the very kind young lady who was {{delegated}} to show me the way, she asked me what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> talk about. And I said I wasn't sure. I said I had some illustrations, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them <b>in.</b> I said I was certain to give those illustrations, but that I hadn't the faintest notion what they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> illustrate.|$|R
60|$|The {{rest of the}} {{men were}} sent round to all the places where work had been <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the tools and dinners to No. 15 stall, to which Jack himself, Bill Haden, and Mr. Brook {{proceeded}} at once. No work had been done there for years. The floor was covered with a black mud, and a close examination of the face showed tiny streamlets of water trickling down in several places. An examination of the stalls, or working places, on either side, showed similar appearances, but in a less marked degree. It was therefore determined to begin work in No. 15.|$|R
5000|$|The Spider's son, Lucas Ludlow-Dalt, {{takes up}} the bow and arrow (and his {{original}} yellow and blue costume) {{in the pages of}} Starman, helping Culp, The Mist, [...] the Rag Doll, Doctor Phosphorus, Solomon Grundy and several other villains lay siege to Opal City during the [...] "Grand Guignol" [...] storyline. This Spider had trained all his life for revenge on the Shade, and comes close to getting it. Matt O'Dare prevents the Spider from killing the Shade, and he is chased off to parts unknown. Lucas later attempts to kill Jack Knight in the final issue of Starman (and nearly kills Mason O'Dare, if not for the timely intervention of the spirit of the deceased magician Zatara). The Shade tells Jack Knight he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>in,</b> since he is a Ludlow.|$|R
50|$|In 1847 the Eastern Counties Railway {{opened a}} line linking Ely-March and Peterborough {{although}} little {{progress was made}} on building a line to the north for some years. In 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was merged {{to become part of}} the Great Eastern Railway (GER). The GER was by this point running all lines in East Anglia but was aware that its reliance on passenger and agricultural traffic was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> significant revenues so once gain looked at extending north with a bill for a railway from March - Spalding was promoted in 1863.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Woman You Love" [...] {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Trent Fitzgerald of Popcrush wrote [...] "This song {{is a great}} {{start for}} Ashanti" [...] and expressed great interest in [...] "what she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> 2012 now that she is an independent woman". The Prophet Blog published that [...] "for her first indie release, Ashanti’s taking it back to basics", writing that the song [...] "harks back to the hard-edged hip-hop of the 90s" [...] and [...] "during {{a time when most}} rappers are lining up to collaborate with David Guetta and RedOne, that’s incredibly refreshing".|$|E
5000|$|... "Sometimes {{you have}} to be an {{accountant}} as asa football manager. It does come down to money. When you come to a club with financial constraints in the division, it was always a challenge to make sure we were a League club. I want to carry on that. The only way forward for a club like ours is loans. We don't have the finances for 52-week contracts but we also have to be realistic to know what sort of players we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in.</b> We need to bring in players who need to have a point to prove and need to perform." [...] - [...] Holdsworth, speaking in November 2012.|$|E
6000|$|A slight gesture {{from the}} Right Bower checked an angry exclamation from the Left. The Old Man {{did not notice}} either, but, {{knitting}} his smooth young brow in a paternally reflective fashion, went on: [...] "You'll {{have to get a}} new pair of trousers, Mills, but as he doesn't keep clothing, we'll have to get some canvas and cut you out a pair. I traded off the beans he let me have for some tobacco for the Right Bower at the other shop, and got them to throw in a new pack of cards. These are about played out. We'll be wanting some brushwood for the fire; there's a heap in the hollow. Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it <b>in?</b> It's the Judge's turn, isn't it? Why, what's the matter with you all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think Lucretia Burns would nag anybody. I don't say you're all to blame, but I'm {{afraid you}} haven't {{acknowledged}} you were any to blame. I'm afraid you've not been patient with her. I'm <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her <b>in.</b> If she comes, will {{you say you}} were part to blame? You needn't beg her pardon--just say you'll try to be better. Will you do it? Think how much she has done for you! Will you?" ...|$|R
50|$|The next {{match was}} a Steel Cage match between Edge and Chris Jericho. When Jericho was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a chair <b>in,</b> Edge stopped him but Jericho slammed the steel cage door on him. Jericho then grabbed {{a chair and}} swung at Edge, but Edge ducked and {{performed}} a Spear on Jericho for a near-fall. Jericho then performed a Codebreaker on Edge for a near-fall. At {{the conclusion of the}} match, Edge performed another Spear on Jericho and pinned Jericho to win the match.|$|R
5000|$|PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman {{called the}} game [...] "OK {{for what it}} is" [...] in his review, praising the story and boss fights, but didn't like the dwarfed {{exploration}} and how dull the combat became as the game went on, saying, [...] "Yakuza: Dead Souls isn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> any new blood to the Yakuza series, but for its existing fans, it provides an interesting story and gameplay elements that haven’t been explored previously. Combat against the common zombies gets old fast, {{but there are some}} great boss battles to balance it out. As a huge Yakuza fan myself, I somewhat enjoyed the game, but wish {{there would have been a}} little better pacing and more chances to explore." ...|$|E

5000|$|As of {{the start}} of season 3, Alex and Nikita are in a good place. They seemed to have matured {{increasingly}} since the last season. Alex saved Nikita's life by taking a bullet to the arm, {{in an attempt to}} push her out of the way. After Nikita returns to Division with a disoriented Alex, anxious Division members awaited to see what their fate would be, her personality changes noticeably. Without getting mad at the recruits, everyone seemed anxious around her, Ryan, Birkoff, and Michael even seemed concerned. Before, Nikita was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the rogue agent with no force. However, her mission shifted after she shot Alex. Ryan asks Nikita,"Why do you think she turn?" [...] Nikita says, [...] "She shot Alex, I don't care." [...] She then coldly leaves the room to go kill the rogue agent. Nikita is always concerned for Alex's welfare, when she heard Alex scream at a Division member, suspected of being a mole, Nikita heard her and quickly went into panic mode trying to find her (season 3 episode 5). When she learns of Alex taking pills, she is heartbroken and disappointed that Alex didn't come to her; however, she eventually tells Alex that they will work through her addiction together. In one of the episode in season 3 Alex had said then Nikita is {{the most important person in}} her life.|$|E
60|$|Steering {{his course}} by the stars, he rode all night without stopping. He doubted {{not that he}} would have at least three hours' start, for the Arabs were sure to have sat that time round the fires before <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> their camels. Even then they would suppose for some time that the animal upon which he was seated had strayed, and no pursuit would be {{attempted}} until it was discovered that he himself had made his escape, which might not be for a long time, as the Arabs would not think of looking under the cloth to see if he were there. He hoped, therefore, that he would reach the cultivated land long before he was overtaken. He had little fear but that he should then be able to journey onward without attracting attention.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{elements}} of interest we encounter in Delmore Schwartz’s literary production, the re-visitation of the Greek chorus is particularly relevant. Its innovatory appeal, in fact, never ignores {{the call of}} tradition, and {{is rooted in the}} main issues of American culture, from immigration and problematic assimilation to the rise of consumer society and mass media. Through the presence of various versions of the chorus, which is alternatively composed of men, ghosts, angels, or even mere voices, and shifting from drama to poetry and vice-versa, the contemporary reader can get an extraordinary focus on the literary, psychological, and social background of the period spanning from the 1930 s to the 1950 s, while reconsidering the meaning of the chorus from different perspectives in the light of Schwartz’s prophetic insight into the deep changes the new millennium was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about <b>in</b> such fields as communication, consciousness, identity, and collectivity...|$|R
5000|$|Arriving at [...] "Bet Akitu", god Marduk {{begins to}} {{celebrate}} {{with both the}} upper and nether world gods (the statues of gods were arranged around a huge table such as in a feast) then Marduk returns to the city at night celebrating his marriage to goddess [...] "Ishtar" [...] where earth and heaven are united, and as the gods unite so is this union arranged on earth. Thus the king personifies this union by {{playing the role of}} marrying the highest priestess of the Esagila where they would both sit at the throne before the population and they recite special poems for the occasion. This love is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> forth life <b>in</b> spring.|$|R
