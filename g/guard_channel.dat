In wireless networks, <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> based Call Admission Control (CAC) schemes {{are widely used}} to protect handoff calls for seamless wireless services. However, the introduction of guard channels in wireless networks results in {{the increase in the}} new call blocking probability.

40|$|Abstract—Dropping {{probability}} of handoff calls and blocking {{probability of}} new calls are two important QoS measures for cellular networks. Since the dropping probability of handoff calls is more important, call admission policies {{are used to}} maintain the upper bound of dropping probability of handoff calls. The fractional <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> policy (FG) is a general call admission policy and includes most prioritized channel allocation schemes such as <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> (GC), limited fractional <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> (LFG), and uniform fractional channel policy (UFC) policies. Since the input traffic is not a stationary process and its parameters are unknown a priori, the optimal value of UFC parameter is not known in advance and possibly varies as traffic conditions change. In this paper, we propose two adaptive algorithms based on learning automata for finding the optimal value of UFC parameter. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, the computer simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that for some range of input traffic, {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithms is close to the performance of the uniform fractional channel policy which knows the traffic parameters a priori.

40|$|Abstract:- In code {{division}} multiple access (CDMA) systems, call admission control (CAC) must be designed to guarantee both grade of service (GoS) at the call level and quality of service (QoS) at the packet level. Basically, {{there are two types of}} CAC schemes for CDMA systems: number-based CAC (NCAC) and interference-based CAC (ICAC). Unlike some previous studies assuming that handoff arrival rate is independent of the new call arrival rate, the handoff call arrival rate is allowed to depend on the new call arrival rate and other system parameters. Furthermore, the distributions of both cell dwell times and call durations are assumed to be hyper-exponential distributions, which is more bursty than the often-used exponential distribution. To prioritize handoff calls over new calls, <b>guard</b> <b>channels</b> are reserved for handoff calls. The appropriate multi-dimensional Markov chain models and analytical methods are derived to compute the performance measures for the considered CAC schemes. The performance measures of interest are new call blocking probability, handoff failure probability, and weighted cost for GoS, and loss probability of the communication quality for QoS. The effects of the variances of cell dwell time and call duration and <b>guard</b> <b>channels</b> on GoS and QoS are studied.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a mobility-aware call ad-mission control (MA-CAC) {{algorithm}} with a handoff queue (HQ) in mobile hotspots, where different admission control policies are employed, {{depending on the}} vehicle mobility. Specifically, when a vehicle is static, a handoff priority scheme with <b>guard</b> <b>channels</b> is studied to protect vehicular handoff users because handoff users may get on the vehicle. In addition, an HQ is examined during stopping to further accept handoff users. On the other hand, for a moving vehicle, no <b>guard</b> <b>channels</b> for handoff users are allocated to maximize channel utilization. By means of Markov chains, we evaluate MA-CAC with an HQ in terms of new-call blocking probability (NCBP), handoff-call dropping probability (HCDP), handoff-call waiting time in the HQ, and channel utilization. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that MA-CAC with an HQ can lower both the HCDP and the NCBP while maintaining high channel utilization.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new dynamic and adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme to prevent handoff failure {{due to lack}} of resources in mobile cellular networks, known as the Measurement-based Pre-assignment (MPr) technique. This technique is particularly useful in micro/pico cellular networks which offers Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee against call dropping. The proposed MPr scheme distinguishes itself from the well-known <b>Guarded</b> <b>Channel</b> based schemes in that it allows the handoff calls to utilize a pre-reserved channel pool before competing for the shared channels with new call arrivals. The key advantage of the proposed MPr scheme is that it can easily derive the number of channels that needs to be reserved for handoff based on a pre-determined call dropping probability, without the need for solving the often complex Markov chain required in <b>Guarded</b> <b>Channel</b> schemes, thus making the proposed MPr scheme simple and efficient for implementation.

Both {{the effect of the}} reneging of waiting new calls because of the callers’ impatience and the effect of the dropping of queued handoff calls as the callers move out of the handoff area are considered, besides the effect of <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> scheme. We successfully solve the system by adopting the multidimensional Markovian chain and using the transition-probability matrix and the signal-flow graph to obtain the average new-call blocking probability, the forced termination probability, and the average waiting time of queued new and handoff calls. We further investigate how the design parameters of buffer sizes and <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> numbers in macrocell and microcells affect the performance of the hierarchi-cal cellular system. The results show that provision of buffering scheme and <b>guard</b> <b>channel</b> scheme can effectively reduce the new-call blocking probability and the forced termination probability in the hierarchical cellular system, and the effectiveness is more significant in the macrocell than in the microcells.
