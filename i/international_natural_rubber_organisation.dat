40|$|<b>International</b> audienceWhile <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is {{commonly}} considered as an incompressible material, this study shows how carbon black-reinforced <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (NR-CB), when subjected to various mechanical loading conditions (uniaxial, hydrostatic, monotonic, cyclic), {{is affected by}} volume change. Experiments show a volume variation even for low straining values and a significant volume change for large elongations. Moreover, volume change can be either reversible or not, depending on the loading conditions. It is related to a competition between void growth, chain orientation, and stress softening. At a microscopic scale, in situ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examinations and image analysis allow one to record damage and microscopic volume change {{as a function of}} elongation. Therefore the volume change measured at the microscopic scale is equal to the macroscopic one. Based on the experimental results, this paper shows that the hypothesis of incompressibility is worth being revisited. Thus, a nearly compressible approach was considered, where the strain energy is assumed to be the sum of spherical and deviatoric parts that are both affected by damage. The model was then implemented in a finite-element code. Good agreement was obtained between experimental results and model predictions for low triaxiality test conditions...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRaw <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{samples of}} {{different}} Mooney viscosity values and inherent molar mass distributions (MMD) {{were used to}} characterize changes occurring during high-temperature mastication and to identify the structural components conditioning mastication-induced degradation. The macrogel degraded rapidly to essentially microgel, the latter of which was also continuously degraded, and at times completely. Mastication provoked decreases in the average molar mass of polyisoprene chains and changes in their MMD. The MMDs evolved differently as mastication progressed, differences that could {{be linked to the}} inherent MMD of each rubber. The non-viscosity stabilized grade rubber (TSR 10) of monomodal MMD was progressively degraded by mastication, whereas rubber of the same grade but with a bimodal MMD was degraded much slowly and even stagnated on prolonged mastication. The stage at which stagnation occurred was characterized by an offset of the balance between long and short polyisoprene chains due to increases in the quantity of short chains, which facilitate the sliding of the longer one...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to immediate type I allergy symptoms, <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex allergy may manifest as protein contact dermatitis on {{the hands of}} health-care workers and other <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex glove users. We examined whether repeated application of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex on mouse skin causes sensitization to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced a strong <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced protein contact dermatitis.

High quality microscopic Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are obtained and the depth profile of ozone and UV treated <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> surface is investigated. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{is one of the}} most important industrial polymer materials, and used as tyres and various parts of automobiles and airplanes. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is composed mainly from polyisoprene and vulcanized to make cross-links between <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> main chains. It is known that degradation features of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are cleavage of C=C double bonds and changes of 3 D cross-link structure. The degradation mechanism is investigated by many spectroscopic methods, for example, FT-IR and NMR. By using Raman spectroscopy, some information about C=C double bonds, characteristic to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be obtained. However, because of the strong fluorescence, it was quite difficult to obtain Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with visible light excitation. It can be possible to obtain Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> only when near infrared light is used as an excitation source. From that point of view, FT-Raman spectroscopy {{is applied to}} investigate a structural change of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> which does not provide microscopic information [1, 2, 3]. Since the near infrared Raman system used here is equipped with a microscope, the rubber degradation can be analysed with a spatial resolution of 1 µm. All the more, optics and gratings are specialized to near infrared light and a liqid-N 2 cooled InGaAs multichannel detector was used to measure high quality Raman spectra of the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> The degradation of the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is thought to mainly result from oxygen, heat, ozone and UV.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is a {{renewable}} resource material with outstanding properties which offers significant advantages over its counterparts, the fossil-resource synthetic rubbers. In fact, a <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> tree is an efficient carbon dioxide sequester. Since <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is a <b>natural</b> product, it {{is subject to}} seasonal variations. The reinforcement of silica in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> for low rolling resistance truck tires is still a challenge. Hence, this thesis aims to understand the silica reinforcing mechanism in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> compounds. In silica technology, the four essential elements which are: elastomer, silica, coupling agent and mixing conditions, need to be properly optimized to achieve a positive compromise between the tire properties. The controlled nano-scale coupling between rubber molecules and the silica surface via a silane coupling agent, is critical not to be disturbed by other surface-active agents. This work focuses {{on the role of}} non-rubber constituents, particularly proteins contained in the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> on silica-silica and silica-silane interactions. Many areas were investigated such as mixing temperature, morphology and dispersion of silica in the NR-silica system, as well as blending <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with synthetic polybutadiene and polyisoprene to enhance silica and <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> interactions.

Various latex-producing plants synthesize <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in their specifically differentiated cells in a manner such that C 5 -monomer units, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) molecules, are sequentially condensed into allylic primers, like FPP or GPP by cis-prenyltransferase (Figure 1) (Takahashi 2006).

Thus materials made from EUG may demonstrate characteristics other than those of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> such as higher elastics, lower thermoplastic temperature, etc.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{potential}} of increasing the weather stability of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex {{for use as a}} water-based contact adhesive, the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex was modified by graft copolymerization with n-butyl acrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA). The grafting reaction was carried out using emulsion polymerization at 60 °C. Potassium persulfate was used to initiate polymerization. Four different weight percentage ratios of BA to MMA used in this work were 95 : 5, 90 : 10, 85 : 15 and 80 : 20. Percentage conversion of the monomer of all latexes prepared was ≥ 79. 5 %. The grafting efficiency of graft-modified <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with a different monomer ratio tends to decrease with an increase of MMA. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR) confirmed that the latexes which were prepared contained graft copolymer. The adhesive performance was characterized by 90 ° peel strength tests. Only graft-modified <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex with the monomer ratio of 80 : 20 possessed an adhesion property enough to conduct peel testing. The peel strength value of graft-modified <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> was lower than that of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex. However, graft-modified <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex tends to have a higher weather stability than <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex...|$|R

The objective is to study the trend of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> to estimate the determinant on supply of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> and to analyze the supply elasticity on supply of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in Malaysia from first quarter 1997 until fourth quarter 2003. Independent variable that has been identifying to complete the study, which is price of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> price of synthetic rubber, price of crude oil, exchange rate, tyre production and gross domestic product (GOP) per capita. Because of the fluctuation happen {{during the period of}} time, researcher interested to know the factors influencing the fluctuation in quantity supply of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in Malaysia. To meet the objective, researcher has used three method of study. For trend analysis, researcher want to figure out the fluctuation happen on independent variable during the period of time. In addition, for supply estimation, researcher used econometric model to analyze the data while supply elasticity calculated using ordinal least square (OLS). The study found that among the independent variable, there are only three variables that significant with the objective which is price of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> price of crude oil and gross domestic product (GOP) per capita. From the estimation result, it shows that synthetic rubber becomes the complementary goods for <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> In addition, elasticity output shows that price of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is inelastic during the period of time...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of a material to stress depends on the chemical bonds found in the chemical structure of the material itself. This thesis deals with the effect of different filler loading on the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> vulcanizates so that the dynamic mechanical properties of vulcanized <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be obtained. The objective of this thesis is to study the effect of different filler loading or amount of filler loaded on <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> that is Standard Malaysian Rubber 10 (SMR- 10). For this study, natural filler that is oil palm trunk fiber which is varies from 0 to 50 phr {{have been used as}} an additive to strengthen the chemical bonds of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> as well as other chemicals that were added to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> Rubber compounds filled with natural fillers and other chemical additives is prepared using a two roll mill and the characteristics of the mechanical properties are studied and analyzed to determine the effect on the {{strength of}} <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> when <b>natural</b> filler is added as filler.
