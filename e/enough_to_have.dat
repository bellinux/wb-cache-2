5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E

5|$|Neptune has 14 moons (one {{of which}} is unnamed); the largest, Triton, {{accounts}} for more than 99.5 percent of all the mass orbiting the planet. Triton is large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but, uniquely for a large moon, has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was captured. Neptune also has six known inner regular satellites, and six outer irregular satellites.|$|E

5|$|The IAU, the internationally {{recognized}} authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies, defines dwarf planets as bodies that are large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, {{but have not}} cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects. Since 2008, there have been five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU. Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

There are another 13 inner moons that orbit within Uranus's ring system, and another nine outer irregular moons.

5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a conversation in that language.

5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, Schiff {{and other}} city leaders contended with local ramifications of the 2008-2012 global recession, which {{included}} spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods. In April 2008, {{the city council}} approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage. The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered forgivable loans to homebuyers {{who were interested in}} properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods. Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.|$|E
5|$|Dormand {{was born}} near Easington at the workingmen's {{club in the}} village of Haswell, when his father Bernard, a former miner, was steward. He was educated locally at Wellfield Grammar School.

There were also 555 men wounded; 53 of those were unfortunate <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been wounded twice.

5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place.

There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack.
