50|$|The word <b>ecomafia</b> appears for {{the first}} time in 1994 in the first report written by Legambiente with the help of Eurispes and Carabinieri. It was then a neologism. A few years later Zingarelli have {{certified}} the usefulness of this term.|$|E
50|$|The {{collaboration}} with the Carabinieri was not granted for an environmental organization in the mid 90s. The task was entrusted to Enrico Fontana, a journalist, a past in the newspaper Paese Sera and then at Espresso. With Stefano Ciafani, Nunzio Cirino and Lorenzo Miracle they started to collect and systematize information and data about environmental crimes. This led to the Report <b>Ecomafia,</b> {{a job in a}} few years has become a reference for those who work to suppress this phenomenon. The relationship grew to work with all law enforcement agencies and now Legambiente works with the National Anti-Mafia pool to fight ecomafie.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The study aims at {{investigating}} whether, and if so, to {{what extent}} the strong presence of urban and industrial waste in a territory may cause PCB contamination in goat milk produced therein. Methods: We compared PCB concentrations in goat milk from three different locations in the Campania region (Italy). One of the three locations, together with its surrounding area, has long suffered from illegal waste disposal and burning mainly by the so-called <b>Ecomafia.</b> The other locations, not involved in these illegal activities, allowed us to create a control group of goats with characteristics very similar to those of main interest. Results: In milk from the waste contaminated area we identified high PCB concentrations (six indicator PCBs amounted to 170 ng g- 1 on lipid weight, on average), whereas there was an almost total absence of such pollutants in milk from the control group. Concentrations of the six indicator PCBs were above the current European maximum residue limit fixed by the EU. At the same time, we found a lower average value of lipid content and a negative relationship between lipid content and PCB concentrations. Conclusion: Evidence indicates the potential health risk for consumers living in areas involved in illegal dumping of waste...|$|E
40|$|The {{twenty-first century}} has {{witnessed}} the exacerbation of ecological issues {{that began to}} manifest themselves in the mid-twentieth century. It has become increasingly clear that the current environmental crisis poses an unprecedented existential threat to civilization {{as well as to}} Homo sapiens itself. Whereas the physical and social sciences have been defining the now inevitable transition to a different (and more inhospitable) Earth, the humanities have yet to assert their role as a transformative force within the context of global environmental change. Turning abstract issues into narrative form, literary writing can increase awareness of environmental issues as well as have a deep emotive influence on its readership. To showcase this type of writing as well as the methodological frameworks that best highlights the social and ethical relevance of such texts alongside their literary value, I have selected the following twenty-first century Italian literary works: Roberto Saviano’s Gomorra, Kai Zen’s Delta blues,Wu Ming’s Previsioni del tempo, Simona Vinci’s Rovina, Giancarlo di Cataldo’s Fuoco!, Laura Pugno’s Sirene, and Alessandra Montrucchio’s E poi la sete, all published between 2006 and 2011. The main goal {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how these works offer an invaluable opportunity to communicate meaningfully and accessibly the discomforting truths of global environmental change, including <b>ecomafia,</b> waste trafficking, illegal building, arson, ozone depletion, global warming and the dysfunctional relationship between humanity and the biosphere...|$|E
