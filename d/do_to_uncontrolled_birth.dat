Case report: The patient was a 28 -year-old pregnant woman referred for cesarean section. After CS, hysterectomy was <b>done</b> due <b>to</b> <b>uncontrolled</b> vaginal bleeding. Peripheral blood smear confirmed the TTP diagnosis. Plasmapheresis was initiated and platelets were infused. Six hours after infusion, tonic-colonic seizure, left hemiplegia and bell's palsy appeared. Brain CT Scan revealed intracranial hemorrhage. 28 plasmapheresis sessions were performed and finally, she was discharged with good general condition...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} uncoupling protein- 3 is {{a member}} of the mitochondrial carrier protein family. As a homologue of the thermogenic brown fat uncoupling protein- 1, it possesses a mitochondrial uncoupling activity and thus can influence cell energy metabolism but its exact biological function remains unclear. In the present study, uncoupling protein- 3 was expressed in 293 cells using the tetracycline-inducible system and its impact on cell bioenergetics and responsiveness to the apoptotic stimulus was determined. The induction of uncoupling protein- 3 expression in mitochondria <b>did</b> not lead <b>to</b> <b>uncontrolled</b> respiratory uncoupling in intact cells. However, it caused a GDP-inhibition of state 4 respiration and a GDP-induced re-polarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the presence of fatty acids, in agreement with its expected physiological behavior as an uncoupling protein (UCP). Uncoupling protein- 3 expression did not cause apoptosis per se but increased the responsiveness of the cells to a mitochondrial apoptotic stimulus (i. e., addition of staurosporine in the culture medium). It enhanced caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation and favored cytochrome c release. Moreover, cells in which uncoupling protein- 3 expression had been induced showed a higher mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio essentially due to enhanced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Finally, the induction of uncoupling protein- 3 also increased the sensitivity of mitochondria to open the permeability transition pore in response to calcium. It is concluded that the presence of uncoupling protein- 3 in mitochondria sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli involving mitochondrial pathways...|$|R
