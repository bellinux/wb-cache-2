500|$|ZANU and ZAPU {{announced}} on 9 October {{that they would}} attend this conference and any thereafter as a joint [...] "Patriotic Front" [...] (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. Kaunda and Nyerere welcomed the new negotiations, but with the Soviet Union proposing that they once again alter their line, the talks were delayed indefinitely. In an attempt to encourage the other parties to travel to Switzerland, British mediator Ivor Richard asked the Rhodesian delegation to hasten their arrival, which they did, leaving Salisbury on 20 October 1976. Richard himself did not arrive until two days later. Some of the guerrillas arriving for the conference from the heat of Mozambique were unprepared for the Swiss winter: Rex Nhongo, for example, felt so cold that he turned every <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> in his room, including the stove, to maximum and went to sleep.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E

50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of <b>heating</b> <b>appliance.</b> A {{convection heater}} may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|E

50|$|A {{wood-burning}} stove (or wood burner or log burner) is a <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> capable of burning wood fuel and wood-derived biomass fuel, such as wood pellets. Generally the appliance {{consists of a}} solid metal (usually cast iron or steel) closed fire chamber, a fire brick base and an adjustable air control. The first wood burning stove was patented in Strasbourg in 1557, two centuries before the Industrial Revolution would make iron an inexpensive and common material, so such stoves were high end consumer items and only gradually spread in use.|$|E

5000|$|Denison Olmsted of New Haven, Connecticut, {{appears to}} have been the {{earliest}} person to use the term 'radiator' to mean a <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> in an 1834 patent for a stove with a heat exchanger which then radiated heat. In the patent he wrote that his invention was a peculiar kind of apparatus, which I call a radiator. The heating radiator was invented by Franz San Galli in 1855, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg. [...] In the late 1800s, companies, such as the American Radiator Company, promoted cast iron radiators over previous fabricated steel designs in order to lower costs and expand the market.|$|E
