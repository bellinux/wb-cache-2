25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the machines operate deterministically.|$|E
25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they {{are created by}} statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E

Another tradition, claims that {{the origin of the}} word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing. They relate this to early days when they used to supply mutton to the kings of Rajasthan. While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1797, Coleridge {{was fascinated}} {{with the idea of}} a river and it was used in {{multiple}} poems including [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Brook". In his Biographia Literaria (1817), he explained, [...] "I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel". It is possible that the imagery of Biographia Literaria followed the recovery of the [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] manuscript during the composition of the book. Water imagery permeated through many of his poems, and the coast that he witnessed on his journey to Linton appears in Osorio. Additionally, many of the images are connected to a broad use of Ash Farm and the Quantocks in Coleridge's poetry, and the mystical settings of both Osorio and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] are based on his idealised version of the region. [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] was composed in the same year as This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, and both poems contained images that were used in the 14 October 1797 letter to Thelwall. However, the styles are very different as one is heavily structured and rhymed while the other tries to mimic conversational speech. What they do have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they use scenery based on the same location, including repeated uses of dells, rocks, ferns, and a waterfall found in the Somerset region. The Preface uses water imagery to explain what happens when visions are lost by quoting a passage from his poem The Picture. When considering all of The Picture and not just the excerpt, Coleridge describes how inspiration is similar to a stream and that if an object is thrown into it the vision is interrupted.|$|E
6000|$|Coal, as {{of course}} you know, is {{commonly}} said to be composed of vegetable matter, of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and trees--a startling statement, and one which I do not wish you to take entirely on trust. I shall therefore spend a few pages in showing you how this fact--for fact it is--was discovered. It {{is a very good}} example of reasoning from the known to the unknown. You will have a right to say at first starting, [...] "Coal is utterly different in look from leaves and stems. The only property which they seem to have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they can both burn." [...] True. But difference of mere look may be only owing to a transformation, or series of transformations. There are plenty in nature quite as great, and greater. What can be more different in look, for instance, than a green field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the baker's? And yet there is, I trust, no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once green wheat, and that the green wheat has been transformed into bread--making due allowance, of course, for the bone-dust, or gypsum, or alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to adulterate his bread, in order to improve the digestion of Her Majesty's subjects.|$|E

50|$|The Great Wardrobe {{dealt with}} a variety of {{commodities}} ranging from cloth, tapestries, clothing and furniture to sugar, spices, dried fruit and pepper; and it later became a repository (and indeed manufactory) of jewellery and other treasures, tents, saddles, bridles, as well as armour and other military items. What all these items had <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> more or less non-perishable and could be stored long-term if not required for immediate use; the Great Wardrobe originated as the department of the King's Wardrobe which was primarily concerned with the storage of such items when not required by the itinerant Court. Part of its distinctiveness, from an early date, was its employment of city merchants and specialist craftsmen, who better knew the particulars of these commodities than did the Wardrobe clerks.|$|R

Some were white, or tan, others were even black, red, or green, and had embroidered or weaved iconography and decoration as well. Textiles at Cahuachi, although second in quantity to Nasca ceramics, are the best indicators of status in a grave.

50|$|Although Otto Müller {{never took}} up a {{teaching}} post at an art academy, his life's work led many colleagues and friends {{to see him as}} the “old master of Halle painting” (Ingrid Schulze 1969). Two professors at the Burg Giebichstein art academy for example, Karl Müller (1888-1972) and Willi Sitte showed their students graphic works by Otto Müller. From the late 1950s onwards, young people with artistic interests sought contact with Otto Müller, resulting in intensive discussions and joint studies of professional artists. These include Falko Warmt (1938 -), with Otto Müller from 1960 to 1963, Karl-Heinz Köhler (1937 -) and Wolfgang Grunwald.

50|$|During {{his time}} on Earth 998, ruled by the evil Queen Jean, X-Man not only met one of his counterparts, but he also learned <b>that</b> there had <b>been</b> many Nate Greys in the multiverse. Obviously, he was not as unique as he thought. Apparently, the one thing all Nates had <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they had <b>been</b> born/created on a {{different}} Earth than the one they later ended up living on. Each Nate Grey being the ultimate telekinetic weapon, Queen Jean hunted them down and lured them to her reality, to {{make good use of}} them. She had her scientists come up with a special genetic brand that would prevent the Nates from burning out their powers. However, most of the Nate Greys were dysfunctional and, when the Queen was unsatisfied with their performance, she killed them and moved on to the next. It is unknown how many Nate Greys fell prey to Queen Jean before she was stopped.|$|R
40|$|Autonomy in {{learning}} is about people taking {{more control over}} their learning in the classrooms, the purpose of learn languages {{and the ways in which}} they learn them. In this way, technology helps much {{in learning}} a language. This paper explores the autonomy as more than preference or strategy by the learner; it must be supported in a systematic way by the teacher and the curriculum for the learner to benefit. The characteristics of successful autonomous learner are explained followed by some examples that shown <b>that</b> learners have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> their attitudes <b>were</b> developed after they made their own decision for themselves that exclusively studying in the classroom environment was not enough. The paper also emphasis on technology approaches in developing learner autonomy, especially by using the computer and the internet. Newer technology, particularly the latest online systems, however, allows sound, movement, interactivity (for exercises, demonstrations, online discussion, etc), and the incorporation of genuine material for learning.   Keywords : Learner autonomy, technology-based approaches, computer, internet Copyright © 2015 by Al-Ta'lim All right reserved </p...|$|R
