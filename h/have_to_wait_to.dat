25|$|According to the model, {{there are}} a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are {{interpreted}} at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> be presented at the theatre.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen pooled his {{resources}} with von Wild and Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps IV. This gave the Luftwaffe some 600 aircraft to support Manstein. Richthofen scraped {{up all the}} forces he could for the assault, getting three dive-bomber, six medium bomber and three fighter Gruppen for the operation. He was not overly concerned with his fighter strength, as his fighters outnumbered the 60-odd aircraft of the Soviet air defence. He could begin close support operations immediately and did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> conduct time-wasting battles for air superiority. So confident was Richthofen that the VVS posed no threat, he lent his Flak forces to the army, though he retained operational control.|$|E

25|$|In the MVC final, the Cougars were {{pitted against}} the 3rd seeded Drake Bulldogs, {{who had already}} won two tournament games. SIUE came out hard, {{dominating}} possession {{during the first half}} and outshooting DU 9 to 1, but the Bulldogs' defense held firm for a 0–0 halftime score. The second half was more evenly played, but Drake was a bit more effective. When the Cougars failed to clear a ball in the 77th minute, Dal Santo made a last instant save that set up a Drake corner kick; the kick bounced around in the six yard box before SIUE finally seemed to clear it, but it went straight toward Drake freshman reserve Ciszweski, who blasted a return shot through the crowd in front of the net that Dal Santo barely saw and had no chance of stopping. The Cougars then intensified their effort after falling behind, but as in the semis, seemed unable to put together an effective attack. In the end, Drake earned its first MVC Tournament title since 2009, and SIUE would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> find out if their record was good enough to get an at-large bid to return to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
500|$|Low was {{employed}} as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. One day, {{he returned to the}} ship when hungry, but was told by the captain he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of rum. At this, Low [...] "took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [...] shot another poor fellow through the throat".|$|E
500|$|This {{ownership}} {{of the land and}} mineral rights had another consequence. [...] In 1896, Edwin B. Foster signed an oil lease for the entire Osage reservation. [...] By 1902 he was shipping 37,000 barrels of oil and by 1906 his companies were producing over 5 million barrels annually. [...] The Osage tribe was one of the wealthiest in the United States, but with the mineral rights transferring to the land owners in 1926, their murder rates also became the highest in the United States. [...] By 1925, Osage families were earning about $65,000 per year, compared to white families that were averaging $1,000. [...] Congress also passed a law providing that an Osage Indian who was less than half blood, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> sell his or her land.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Lynsey became {{attracted}} to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) {{and they began}} a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> see what would happen between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E
2500|$|Part of the {{proceedings}} turned {{on the question of}} proper evasive tactics against submarines. It was put to Captain Turner that he had failed to comply with Admiralty instructions to travel at high speed, maintain a zig-zag course and keep away from shore. Naval instructions about zig-zag were read to the captain, who confirmed that he had received them, though later added that they {{did not appear to be}} as he recollected. This was unsurprising, since the regulations quoted had only been approved on 25 April, after Lusitanias last arrival in New York, and started distribution on 13 May, after she sank. Lusitania had slowed to 15 knots at one point because of fog, but had otherwise maintained 18 knots passing Ireland. 18 knots was faster than all but nine other ships in the British merchant fleet could achieve and was comfortably faster than the submarine. Although he might have achieved 21 knots and had given orders to raise steam ready to do so, he was also under orders to time his arrival at Liverpool for high tide so that the ship would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> enter port. Thus, he chose to travel more slowly. At the time, no ship had been torpedoed travelling at more than 15 knots. Although the Admiralty instructed ships to keep well offshore and it was claimed that Turner had only been [...] away, his actual distance when hit was [...] As a matter of established procedure, only ships travelling closer than [...] from shore were ordinarily being censured for being too close.|$|E

2500|$|WCW's {{next big}} attempt to regain ratings {{supremacy}} was by marketing ex-NFL player Bill Goldberg as an invincible monster with a record-breaking winning streak. Goldberg was incredibly popular, but business still quickly fell off for WCW, {{especially as the}} list of stars ready to be destroyed by Goldberg grew shorter, {{not to mention the}} declining quality of the PPVs. One of WCW's last wins in the Monday night ratings war was on July 6, 1998, when WCW aired Goldberg's long-awaited world title victory over Hulk Hogan on free television. This significantly increased the rating for the show, but only for that week. Such a match could likely have generated millions, possibly tens of millions for WCW on pay-per-view had the angle been built up properly for a matter of months. On September 14, 1998, WCW won the ratings war once again with a memorable moment that featured Ric Flair's return to WCW and the reformation of the legendary Four Horsemen. On October 25, 1998, WCW's Halloween Havoc ran longer than the time allocated because of the last-minute addition of a tag team title match between the champions (Scott Steiner and The Giant) and the challengers (Rick Steiner and Buff Bagwell), which Rick Steiner won by himself although Bagwell abandoned him as a tag partner. As a result, several thousand people lost their pay-per-view feed at 11pm during the highly [...] anticipated world title match between Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg. The following night, WCW decided to correct the fault by airing the entire match for free on Nitro and won the ratings war for the final time. This timing faux pas upset millions of viewers who had paid for the pay-per-view of whom WCW were forced to reimburse, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> see the main event for free the next night [...]|$|E

60|$|Now, the steamers, {{when they}} arrive at Liverpool, cannot usually go {{directly}} up to the pier, because the water is not deep enough there, except at particular states of the tide. They accordingly have to anchor in the stream, at {{some distance from the}} shore. As soon as they anchor, whether it is by day or by night, a small steamer comes alongside to get the mails and the despatches; for they must be landed immediately, so as to proceed directly to London by the first train. The bearer of despatches, together with his family, or those whom he has directly under his charge, are, of course, allowed to go on shore in the small steamer with the despatch bag, {{but the rest of the}} passengers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> have their trunks and baggage examined by the custom-house officers. If the vessel gets to Liverpool in the night, they have to wait until the next morning. This was what the captain meant by saying, that, if the children went on shore with Mr. Chauncy, they would go in the night; for he then expected to get to his anchoring ground so that the boat for the mails would come off to the ship at about half past twelve.|$|E
