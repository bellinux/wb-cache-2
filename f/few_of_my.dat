Les having used guitar on his bass tracks with Mary earlier. On all their recordings (as good as they were), I always missed that deep dark sound... Mary (bless her heart) recorded a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> compositions (never released), but she {{did an excellent job}} as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and I see him occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.|$|E

500|$|A trilogy {{of young}} adult novels, The Whitby Witches, makes {{much of the}} town's setting and history, embellishing local traditions whilst {{incorporating}} them into the narrative. The author, Robin Jarvis, recalls [...] "The first time I visited Whitby, I stepped off the train and knew I was somewhere very special. It was a grey, drizzling day but that only added to the haunting beauty and lonely atmosphere of the place. Listening to Carmina Burana on my headphones, I explored the ruined abbey on the clifftop. The place was a fantastic inspiration. In the Whitby Witches I have interwoven many of the existing local legends, such as the frightening Barguest, whilst inventing a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own, most notably the aufwaders." [...] Jarvis returned to Whitby for his 2016 novel, The Power of Dark, the first in The Witching Legacy series.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good. To get a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|The task of {{formally}} investigating {{student and}} alumni complaints fell to L. Hollingsworth Wood, Vice-Chair of Fisk's board of trustees, and chief {{spokesman for the}} trustees. Du Bois criticized Wood in articles in The Crisis, accusing him of ignoring evidence of McKenzie's [...] "incompetency" [...] and suggesting that Wood advised the Greater Fisk Committee [...] "to keep silent." [...] Wood reported, [...] "Our colored friends do not quite realize what they demand of a person in McKenzie's position and {{of his wife and}} children." [...] "I am sure if I took the presidency of Fisk and played golf or hunted or danced or dined with the cultured whites of Nashville that but <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> many Negro friends would keep unshaken faith in me, and many would attribute sinister motives to perfectly innocent actions on my part." [...] Wood sympathized with some of the students' demands, noting their irritation over [...] "some rather antiquated regulations as to dress and discipline," [...] and conceding that [...] "President's McKenzie's Scotch nature is a bit unbending." [...] Wood responded to accusations that Fisk was at the mercy of Southern interests, declaring, [...] "that there has been anything even distantly resembling ‘Selling out to the South' is utterly preposterous. Wood praised McKenzie in gaining the good will of the citizens of Nashville, Vanderbilt and Peabody Colleges, but this ‘keeping-the-Negro-in-his-place" [...] cry is utterly unfounded." ...|$|E
