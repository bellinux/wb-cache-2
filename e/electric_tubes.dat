5000|$|In the English service <b>electric</b> <b>tubes</b> (in the United States called [...] "primers") {{are mostly}} used, but {{percussion}} or friction tubes are preferred {{on the continent}} and <b>electric</b> <b>tubes</b> are seldom or never used.|$|E
50|$|In {{ancient times}} various devices were adopted to ignite the charge. Small guns were fired by priming powder poured down the touch hole (or vent) and ignited by glowing embers or a red-hot iron rod. Later the priming powder was ignited by {{a piece of}} slow match held in a linstock (a stick with a clamp at one end). About 1700, this was {{effected}} {{by means of a}} port-fire. This was a paper case about 16 inch (406 mm) long filled with slow-burning composition which burnt rather more than one inch (25 mm) per minute. Later again the charge was exploded by paper tubes (sometimes called Dutch tubes) filled with powder and placed in the vent and ignited by a port-fire. In comparatively modern times friction tubes have been used, while in the latest patterns percussion or <b>electric</b> <b>tubes</b> are employed.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Dr. Irving Langmuir {{actively}} studied plasma discharge and surface science. Since then, great {{progress has been made}} in the development of applications of discharges and plasmas such as discharge lamps, <b>electric</b> <b>tubes,</b> and arc welding. In relation to studies on space physics and controlled nuclear fusion, plasma physics has greatly advanced. Plasma chemistry has also progressed along with its applications in LSI fabrication technology, the chemical vapor deposition of functional films, and the production of nanomaterials. In the twenty-first century, the further development of applications of plasma physics and plasma chemistry is certainly expected. In this book, 18 chapters on the recent progress in plasma science and technology have been written by active specialists worldwide...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} compact {{scanning}} tunneling microscope (STM) for operation in air is described. The design of the STM unit {{is based on the}} inertial sliding systems described in the literature, with sonic modifications to improve the stability of the scan unit. The STM is built of two concentric piezo <b>electric</b> <b>tubes,</b> the inner one for scanning the tip and the outer one for moving the sample holder towards or away from the tip. The vibration isolation system, mechanical construction of the scan unit, probe tip preparation, analogue and computer control electronics have all been described in this article. An analogue feedback system has been used for the constant current imaging. Images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite have been obtained in air both on constant current and constant height modes of operation. The atomic resolution images obtained show lattice hexagonal lattice of graphite clearly...|$|E

50|$|The {{percussion}} tube has {{a similarly}} shaped {{body to the}} wireless <b>electric</b> <b>tube,</b> but the internal construction differs; it is fitted with a striker, below which is a percussion cap on a hollow brass anvil, and the tube is filled with powder.|$|R
60|$|Rob {{knew there}} would be trouble the moment he looked at this evil crew, and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began {{fiercely}} shouting in an unknown tongue, the boy sighed and took the <b>electric</b> <b>tube</b> from his coat pocket.|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of Edison's system of electric lighting, Kruesi moved to more management positions. In 1881, Edison put Kruesi {{in charge of the}} Edison <b>Electric</b> <b>Tube</b> Company, making him responsible for the installation of underground power distribution cables from the central generating station. Kruesi was also an inventor, while at the <b>Electric</b> <b>Tube</b> Company, he devised a two wire conduit in which two semicircular conductors were separated by an insulator and covered in insulating material. Kruesi became assistant general manager of the lower Manhattan Edison Machine Works in 1894. The Edison Machine Works moved to Schenectady, NY in 1886 and was merged into Edison General Electric in 1889. When that company merged with several others to form General Electric Company in 1892, Kruesi was promoted to General Manager, and then to Chief Mechanical Engineer at the Schenectady site in 1896.|$|R

50|$|At NTRI, Ito became {{involved}} with analyzing long-distance radio communications, and wanted to investigate the interaction of microwaves with the Kennelly-Heaviside layer (the ionosphere). He started a project using a Barkhausen-Kurz tube, then tried a split-anode cavity magnetron developed by Kinjiro Okabe at Tohoku University, but the frequency was too unstable. In late 1932, believing that the magnetron would eventually become the primary source for microwave power, he started his own research in this technology, calling the device a magnetic <b>electric</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
40|$|West Bengal {{had started}} a program of {{metering}} of agricultural tube wells in 2007.

Why is it then that the government of West Bengal succeeded when others floundered?

It also suggests a few generic steps that other states may adopt in their quest for universal metering. West Bengal {{had started a}} program of metering of agricultural tube wells in 2007.

40|$|The tachyon {{effective}} field theory describing the dynamics of a non-BPS D-$p$-brane has <b>electric</b> flux <b>tube</b> solutions where the electric field is at its critical value and the tachyon is at its vacuum. It {{has been suggested that}} these solutions have the interpretation of fundamental strings. We show that in order that an <b>electric</b> flux <b>tube</b> can `end' on a kink solution representing a BPS D-$(p- 1) $-brane, the electric flux must be embedded in a tubular region inside which the tachyon is finite rather than at its vacuum where it is infinite. Energetic consideration then forces the transverse `area' of this tube to vanish. We suggest a possible interpretation of the original <b>electric</b> flux <b>tube</b> solutions around the tachyon vacuum as well as of tachyon matter as system of closed strings at density far above the Hagedorn density.

When an electric current passes through, the bridge is heated to incandescence and ignites the priming composition.|$|R
