40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop new {{catalytic}} media filters in order to remove at high temperature dust and organic compounds from the fourth hole of an electric arc furnace (EAF). Such a filtration could improve the cost-efficiency of <b>dedusting</b> <b>equipment</b> by reducing the energy needed for cooling fumes and simplifying {{the layout of the}} dedusting device. A major aspect of this project was the development and the laboratory testing of new catalytic filtering media composed mainly of FeCrAl alloys. Among the large combination of materials tested, the most promising seems to be metal fibres treated by reactive vapour. Cartridge devices of such media have been developed and tested on an electric arc furnace. Four months of tests were carried out connecting a pilot unit on the exhaust gas stream of an EAF in a steel plant. The results achieved show that the media can reduce organic emissions from the furnace, but some improvement should be made in the manufacturing of the cartridges in order to reduce side effects, such as clogging of the media. For new developments in industry, an industrial pilot unit will be necessary to optimise several components of the system and to test these components for a longer period...|$|E
40|$|Thermal power {{stations}} emit {{significant amounts of}} fly ash and ultra fine particles into the atmosphere. Electrostatic precipitators (ESP) or electro filters remove flying ashes and fine particles from the flue gas before passing the gas into the chimney. Maximum allowable value of dust is 50 mg/m 3 and it requires that {{the efficiency of the}} ESPs better than 99 %, which calls for an increase of active surface of the electrodes, hence increasing the filter volume and the weight of steel used for the filter. In previous decades, electrostatic precipitators in thermal power plants were fed by thyristor controlled, single phase fed devices having a high degree of reliability, but with a relatively low collection efficiency, hence requiring large effective surface of the collection plates and a large weight of steel construction in order to achieve the prescribed emission limits. Collection efficiency and energy efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator can be increased by applying high frequency high voltage power supply (HF HV). Electrical engineering faculty of the University of Belgrade (ETF) has developed technology and HF HV equipment for the ESP power supply. This solution was subjected to extensive experimental investigation at TE Morava from 2008 to 2010. High frequency power supply is proven to reduce emission two times in controlled conditions while increasing energy efficiency of the precipitator, compared to the conventional thyristor controlled 50 Hz supply. Two high frequency high voltage unit AR 70 / 1000 with parameters 70 kV and 1000 mA are installed at TE Morava and thoroughly testes. It was found that the HF HV power supply of the ESP at TE Morava increases collection efficiency so that emission of fine particles and flying ashes are halved, brought down to only 50 % of the emissions encountered with conventional 50 Hz thyristor driven power supplies. On the basis of this study, conclusion is drawn that the equipment comprising HF HV supplies are the best solution for new ESP installations, {{as well as for the}} reconstruction of existing facilities. The paper describes the topology of the HF HV power supply, power management and controls, and brings the most important details of the implementation. It is found that the HF HV solution achieves several significant improvements over the conventional thyristor system. It is possible to provide more precise control of the ESP parameters such as the output voltages and currents. It is also possible to make a rapid increase or decrease in voltage and to effectuate a very fast response to load changes. Due to this advantages it is possible to suppress the supply quickly in the case of sparking, reducing the spark energy and the quantity of ionized gasses produced by the electric arc. Reduction in the spark energy is up to 10 times compared to conventional thyristors solution. This means that the erosion of the electrode system is significantly reduced, and that the quality of the collection plates is preserved for much longer periods. At the same time, lower quantity of ionized gasses produced by the spark contribute to much shorter deionization intervals, required to quit sparking and evacuate charged particles in order to reinstate the voltage and proceed with the operation. In addition, HF HV power supply provides a significant reduction in size and weight of the complete ESP installation, hence reducing the tons of steel that has to be built in. Therefore, the HF HV power supply may be the key instrument to reducing the cost of the <b>dedusting</b> ecological <b>equipment.</b> Besides, size and weight reduction leads to cost savings of installation and maintenance. According to estimates, savings in steel may reach 30 %, contributing to the overall cost savings of roughly 20 %. Within this paper, in addition to describing the AR 70 / 1000 unit topology and principles of operation, the paper presents the results and measurements obtained during extensive experimental investigations wherein performances of 50 Hz based thyristor units with T/R sets are compared to HF HV power supply...|$|R
