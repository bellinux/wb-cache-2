40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively. The thrust modeling of the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and second <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> includes two different kinds of processes: shearing and ploughing.

40|$|Now {{that there}} is a need to {{increase}} a processing capacity, curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills find ever-growing use. Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills. A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mill profile. Larger thickening is observed if the chip load is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable chip load thickness is equal to feed per revolution.

It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|R
