5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the <b>humor</b> <b>of</b> the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E

Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Baron {{appeared}} as a character in John Kendrick Bangs's comic novels A House-Boat on the Styx, Pursuit of the House-Boat, and The Enchanted Type-Writer. Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published Mr. Munchausen, a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and <b>humor</b> <b>of</b> the original tales.

It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the <b>humor</b> <b>of</b> the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E

50|$|Aggressive {{humor is}} a style <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that is {{potentially}} detrimental towards others.

Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness.|$|R

40|$|Philosophies <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> {{date back}} at least to antiquity, but {{linguistic}} study <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> has developed only recently, perhaps due to the "lighthearted" nature of the field. Since its emergence as a serious linguistic topic, linguists have worked to formalize a linguistic theory <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> While many different methods for such a formalized theory have been proposed, Raskin (1985) has made the largest strides in this direction with his SEMANTIC SCRIPT THEORY <b>OF</b> <b>HUMOR</b> (SSTH). This theory provides the most complete linguistic theory <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and a good framework from which to work to achieve a complete linguistic analysis <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> One <b>of</b> the key elements <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that Raskin does not address is the great variance in how funny jokes are. This paper examines the literature concerning humor studies, describes the basic premises underlying Raskin's SSTH, and then provides an extension to the theory, the EXTENDED INCONGRUITY MODEL (EIM), consisting of culture-neutral ways to predict how well a joke will be received. Specifically, the paper draws on ideas from the cognitive linguistics SURPRISE DISAMBIGUATION (SD) model <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and explores new criteria for determining not only what constitutes a joke, but what constitutes a strong joke, as opposed to a weak joke. Using these criteria in tandem with the existing theory extends the scope of Raskin's theory and moves linguistics closer to a full accounting of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>humor...</b>|$|R
