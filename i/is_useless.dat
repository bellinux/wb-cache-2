5|$|Spider-Man {{enters the}} lizard room where Connors has taken refuge. Connors knocks {{him out and}} Eddie arrives to help him out. When he regains consciousness, Spider-Man {{comes up with a}} plan to trick him into the polar bear pond. They almost succeed when Connors is alerted by Spider-Man's {{cellphone}} ringing. Billy then arrives and tries to talk some sense into his father, but it <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the cleanser into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more.|$|E
5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, {{but it was so}} damaged by fire that it <b>is</b> <b>useless.</b> The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh's Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>useless.</b> He couldn't read. He couldn't do anything. The wailing of {{the child}} pierced the drum of his ear.

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> for {{the manager}} {{to make any}} protest. He was eager to keep Jet with the company, for he had seen that he could please the public; but after quite a lengthy {{conversation}} the boy's determination {{was so strong that}} it would have <b>been</b> <b>useless</b> to oppose him further.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E

25|$|If {{skills and}} customs don't {{work in the}} new situation, these die out, or those holding them do. Children adapt {{naturally}} to the new situation, and immediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than reading and writing.

25|$|An October 2009 poll by Léger Marketing {{found that}} 45% of Canadians {{consider}} the monarchy to be useless to Canada {{and feel that}} the country should sever all formal ties with the Queen, while 44% considered the monarchy to be a tradition that should be maintained. Opposition to the institution was strongest in Quebec where 78% believe the monarchy <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> to Canada and should be ended, and 11% wanted to maintain it.|$|E
25|$|Over 80% of the state's area {{is owned}} by the federal government. The primary reason for this is homesteads were not {{permitted}} in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert Nevada. Instead, early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source, and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land, which <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> for agriculture without access to water (this pattern of ranching still prevails).|$|E
25|$|When {{camouflage}} {{fails to}} protect them, blue-tongued skinks {{will try to}} ward off attackers by displaying their blue tongues, and the frill-necked lizard will display its brightly colored frill. These same displays are used in territorial disputes and during courtship. If danger arises so suddenly that flight <b>is</b> <b>useless,</b> crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an enemy. Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate {{the tip of the}} tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow beads to ward of approaching danger.|$|E

25|$|Before the invasion, the Japanese {{government}} had printed unnumbered military yen notes {{for the use}} in every occupied territories in Southeast Asia. As {{there is a widespread}} currency inflation during the war, the value of this money fluctuated erratically thus exchange with the former British Borneo dollars <b>is</b> <b>useless.</b> Increasing inflation coupled with Allied disruption of Japan's economy forced the Japanese administration to issue banknotes of larger denominations and increase the amount of money in circulation. From January 1942, the Japanese decide the military notes should be in par with the national yen.|$|E
25|$|Resurgence: Returning oneself {{or others}} from the dead to full life. It is {{powerful}} enough to heal the skin of burnt corpses and even fuse limbs not previously attached to the body. The power <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> if the body is in too many pieces. Not {{to be confused with}} the Resurrection Spell which can be done by any witch that performs the ritual and incantation, often with undesirable results in accordance with the witches power and adherence to the spell. Nor is it the same as the Voodoo power of Necromancy which creates mindless zombies.|$|E
25|$|A way for {{reducing}} this number is to disallow {{the generation of}} some tableau based on their internal structure. An example is the condition of regularity: if a branch contains a literal, using an expansion rule that generates the same literal <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> because the branch containing two copies of the literals {{would have the same}} set of formulae of the original one. This expansion can be disallowed because if a closed tableau exists, it can be found without it. This restriction is structural because it can be checked by looking at the structure of the tableau to expand only.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{reference}} to the Bhagavad Gita in Buddhist literature, the Tripitaka. The Buddha refers to 3 Vedas rather than 4 Vedas, as per general perception in many dialogues. So, there is doubt about whether the Bhagavad Gita was widely known about during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha.The Namboothiris of Kerala follows 3 Vedas only. According to Manusmriti (the law book of Manu) a Brahmanan who does not know the Vedic verses (at least of one Vedam) <b>is</b> <b>useless.</b> So {{it is safe to}} say Buddha only mentioned 3 Vedas just like the Brahman community of Kerala.|$|E
25|$|Popular Islam {{is based}} mostly on oral tradition. Imams with {{virtually}} no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination {{plays an important role}} in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur'an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, and jinns (spirits).|$|E
25|$|After fraud was alleged in {{the mayoral}} {{election}} of 2012 in Astrakhan and the United Russia candidate was declared the winner, {{organizers of the}} 2011–2012 Russian protests supported the defeated candidate, Oleg V. Shein of Just Russia, in a hunger strike. Substantial evidence of fraud was cited by the protesters but an official investigation failed to find significant violations. The activists from Moscow {{found it difficult to}} gain traction over the issue with local residents who, like most Russians, accept political corruption as a given that <b>is</b> <b>useless</b> to protest. The emissaries from Moscow persisted, buoyed by celebrities who support the reform movement, drawing 1,500 to a rally on 14 April.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGiven a prior {{probability}} distribution over {{a set of}} possible oracle functions, we define a number of queries to <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> for determining some property of the function if {{the probability that the}} function has the property is unchanged after the oracle responds to the queries. A familiar example is the parity of a uniformly random Boolean-valued function over { 1, 2,…,N}, for which N− 1 classical queries <b>are</b> <b>useless.</b> We prove that if 2 k classical queries <b>are</b> <b>useless</b> for some oracle problem, then k quantum queries <b>are</b> also <b>useless.</b> For such problems, which include classical threshold secret sharing schemes, our result also gives a new way to obtain a lower bound on the quantum query complexity, even in cases where neither the function nor the property to be determined is Boolean...|$|R
