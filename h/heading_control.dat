40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} {{constraint}} violation and feasibility issues of model predictive control (MPC) for ship <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> in wave fields, a novel disturbance compensating MPC (DC-MPC) algorithm {{has been proposed}} to satisfy the state constraints {{in the presence of}} environmental disturbances. The capability of the novel DC-MPC algorithm is first analyzed. Then, the proposed DC-MPC algorithm is applied to solve the ship <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> problem, and its performance is compared with a modified MPC controller, which considers the estimated disturbance in the opti-mization directly. The simulation results show good performance of the proposed controller in terms of reducing heading error and satisfying yaw velocity and actuator saturation constraints.

40|$|Offshore {{activities}} in ice-covered waters are gaining increased attention nowadays. Such operations as crew change, lifting, installation, drilling, etc. may require keeping the vessel {{on a fixed}} location during long time periods. The use of dynamic positioning systems appears therefore to be an attractive solution, being much more flexible than mooring operations. However, the ice environment is significantly different from open water conditions. As known from several full-scale experiments, systems developed for open water purpose do not answer all ice challenges. Nevertheless, recent R&D projects have demonstrated the feasibility of DP in ice. During the DYPIC project, a European collaborative program, large amount of ice model basin tests have been performed at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. Those tests have not only spotlighted stationkeeping possibilities under certain challenging conditions, but have also brought out several important aspects of ice forces on the hull. In this paper, the DYPIC outcomes are used to build an automatic <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> system for a DP vessel {{in order to improve}} its stationkeeping abilities in ice. The system with automatic heading is then compared in a numerical simulation framework to a system with fixed heading. The results show that in selected scenarios the DP system with automatic <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> outperforms clearly the one with fixed <b>heading</b> <b>control.</b> Specifically, the ice loads and the power consumption are reduced considerably. 1...|$|E

To ensure that this requirement is met active <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> is being implemented on the Orion crew module. This technique reduces probability of roll-over during splashdown, assures axial loads on the crew at touchdown, and alleviates structural requirements on impact allowing for a light-weight structural design. On-board sensors are used to measure current vehicle orientation and horizontal velocity used in generation of the heading error signal. Linear velocity measured by the IMU drifts while under parachutes due to wind gusts and has to be corrected by GPS; this makes GPS critical for successful landing. Jet fire logic is achieved by use of a phase-plane and commands are realized by using roll jets from the reaction control system (RCS); using pre existing hardware eliminates additional hardware and structural requirements. Touchdown performance is measured by an orientation envelope that was co-developed with structures {{so that the}} performance requirements overlap adding system redundancy. <b>Heading</b> <b>control</b> also introduces new difficulties to be addressed such as parachute line twist torque as well as increasing vehicle sensitivity to wind shifts and sea states.

The <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> employed on each vehicle is a discretization of the well-known Kuramoto model of nonlinearly coupled oscillators over a sequence of logical graphs. Stability for both all-to-all and random one-to-all broadcasts is shown to be dependent on the coupling strength, K, and the time discretization, ∆T. For desired system performance characteristics, ∆T imposes a tight deadline by which the state information (M bits) must be propagated through the communication network. Routing optimization with respect to minimizing energy consumption is formulated considering the ∆T deadline. Due to tight time deadline a one-to-all single-hop broadcasting scheme is shown to be more energy efficient for practical choices of M/∆T.

AUV requires autonomous guidance and control systems to perform underwater applications. This Thesis is concerned with position and <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> of AUV using Model Predictive Control. Position control is a typical motion control problem, which {{is concerned with the}} design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and maintain a fixed position. The position control of body fixed x-axis to a fixed point using MPC toolbox of MATLAB is done here. System is modelled Using INFANTE AUV hydrodynamic parameters. There is physical limitation on thruster value. <b>Heading</b> <b>control</b> is concerned with the design of control laws that force a vehicle to reach and maintain a fixed direction. There are physical limitations on control input (Rudder deflection) in <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> also a high yaw rate can produce sway and roll motion, which makes it necessary to put constraint on yaw rate. The MPC have a clear advantage in case of control and input constraints. To avoid constraint violation and feasibility issues of MPC for AUV <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> Disturbance Compensating (DC) MPC scheme is used. The DC-MPC scheme is used for ship motion control and gave better results so we are using the proposed scheme to AUV <b>heading</b> <b>control.</b> A 2 DOF AUV model is taken with yaw rate and rudder deflection constraints. Line of sight (LOS) guidance scheme is utilised to generate the reference heading, which is to be followed. Two types of disturbances are taken constant and sinusoidal. Then simulation has been done for standard MPC, M-MPC and DC-MPC. A (DC) MPC algorithm is used to satisfy the state constraints in presence of disturbance to get a better performance. Standard MPC gives good result without disturbance. But in case of disturbance yaw constraint is violated. At many time steps the standard MPC has no solution for given yaw rate constraint at those time steps the constraints have been removed. The M-MPC satisfies the constraints. The DC-MPC gives better result in comparison to standard MPC and Modified MPC. The steady state oscillations are less in DC-MPC as compared to M-MPC for sinusoidal disturbances. The minimization of extra cost function in DC-MPC makes the result better than M-MPC. By solving the extra cost function we try to make response close to that of without disturbance. The only added complexity in DC-MPC is ni-dimensional optimization problem. Which is very less compared to Np*ni, complexity of M-MPC. Where ni is the dimension of control input and Np is value of prediction horizon. The feasibility of DC-MPC scheme largely depends on the magnitude of disturbance. If disturbance is too large then this scheme is not feasible. ...|$|E
