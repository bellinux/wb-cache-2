The roles and relationships of various views described by Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Statechart Diagrams and Activity Diagrams are clarified and the missing information is supplied to facilitate the design of a uniform executable workflow model. As a result, the process models defined in the proposed way are consistent with XPDL semantics and can be readily translated to an XPDL file with the aid of an XSLT processor. 1...|$|R

To use language as significantly as in human problemsolving it is necessary to design language processors specially suited to the task. The procesBoi should use language as a medium for describing situations so that their similarities are recognized. Recognition of such similarity would enable the system to respond to new situations with forms of response known to be appropriate in similar, <b>familiar</b> situations. The <b>design</b> <b>and</b> implementation of a problem-solving system based on this principle are described.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{proposed}} an integration process to incorporate sustainability issues into engineering design for construction projects. To facilitate use by engineers, the integration process {{was built on}} the traditional design process. Design work is the foundation for the integration process. Because engineers are <b>familiar</b> with <b>design</b> work <b>and</b> processes, the linkage between the eight <b>design</b> steps <b>and</b> six integration steps make the integration more concrete. The study results show that the integration process can help participants to incorporate sustainability issues, communicate with stakeholders, and achieve consensus, if followed rigorously. The integration steps, such as creation of the integration team and evaluation of alternatives, are similar to the elements dealt with in environmental impact assessment. Since sustainability integration is actually a decision-making and execution process, its management should have the attention of the government, construction owner, and integration team...|$|R

In this experiment, students will be utilizing what I have seen called the “commercial ” or “institutional” slime. This lab activity utilizes poly (vinyl alcohol), PVA, and a borax solution to process the slime. The sheer size of the PVA molecules (average molecular weight can surpass 100, 000 grams per mole) provides students with a real-world example of how large organic molecules can become. Handling the viscous slime, along with seeing the figure of cross-linking in the handout, further illustrates how large and cumbersome some organic molecules are. Finally, leaving flexibility for students to schedule their own concentrations for the final two trials, as well as leaving the data and observations space blank on the handout, allows students to take greater control of their research.

One of the mobile applications, location-based service (LBS), has attracted great attention recently.
