2500|$|Many {{infections and}} {{parasitic}} infestations produce {{patterns of the}} luminal surface, which are best seen on Barium examinations. Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. Barium studies show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasites’ intestinal tracts on delayed images. In Strongyloidiasis barium studies show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms [...] have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of <b>haustration,</b> and stenosis in Barium X-rays. Anisakiasis is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30cm long. In Typhlitis Barium studies show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening. In pseudomembranous colitis, barium studies show pancolitis with thumb printing and shaggy margins as well as plaque-like eccentric, nodular or polypoid appearance.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{some authors}} {{investigated}} CTC {{in the assessment}} of large bowel abnormalities in IBD patients, such as mural thickening, lumen narrowing, loss of <b>haustration,</b> and pseudopolyps. However, in this population air insufflation should be performed carefully because the inflamed, more fragile intestinal wall poses a greater risk of colonic perforation [10 – 12]. Furthermore, conflicting CTC results with unsatisfactory visualisation of subtle mucosal changes and limited assessment of mural thickening led the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) to state in their guidelines that “the limited available data do not demonstrate a diagnostic value for assessing the disease extent in patients with suspected or proven UC” [28].|$|E
30|$|The {{surgical}} rectum extends for 12 - 15  cm endoscopically {{from the}} anal verge. The {{length of the}} rectum {{is dependent on the}} size of the patients. In tall males the rectum can be 17 - 20  cm long and in women less than 15  cm. The exact length can be evaluated best on the sagittal plane. However, for simplicity, 15  cm measured with a rigid sigmoidoscope has been used as standard. The anatomical definition of the rectosigmoid junction is based on <b>haustrations.</b> <b>Haustrations</b> are present in the sigmoid colon and absent in the rectum. In fact, “rectum” refers to the straight portion of the colon in the sense that the rectum lacks <b>haustrations.</b> Otherwise the rectum is much less straight than the name implies. In patients with diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, this junction is appreciated more readily, as diverticula (more accurately referred to as pseudo-diverticula) denote sigmoid colon and not rectum. On high-resolution MRI, the rectosigmoid junction is the location where the rectum becomes completely covered by peritoneum. This is appreciated ventral to the rectum where the peritoneal reflection is detected. The rectosigmoid junction is orientated obliquely towards the sacrum. The peritoneal reflection is sometimes located more distally in women with a deep Douglas pouch, than in men [23]. In summary, the upper distinction of the rectum is 15  cm above the anal verge based on the rigid sigmoidoscope as most previous studies have used this definition. However, the radiologist should inform the members of the multidisciplinary team when a tumour originates from a mobile portion of the colon with a mesentery root, as this may be of relevance for the radiation target.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of {{prominent}} semi-lunar folds the <b>haustrations</b> become deeper and {{are more difficult to}} inspect in 3 D. This is particularly the case in the ascending and transverse colon, and in {{the case of}} diverticulosis. Using 2 D allows complete visualisation. Using 3 D by turning the virtual camera between the folds, ensuring complete visualisation, is mandatory. Some software is provided with a missed region tool. This tool automatically shows the regions not covered during the regular fly-through in an antegrade and retrograde direction. Other software allows for alternative visualisation methods such as virtual pathological features depictinging the colon as if it were laid open showing all the hidden spots [14].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study aims {{to clarify}} the ideal {{technique}} of virtual colonoscopy and how to avoid pitfalls. Patient and methods 200 patients were referred for VC screening. Results 3 D VC false positive results were as follows: Pseudopolyps due to fecal residue (17. 5 %), under-distended colon (2 %), segmental spasm (1 %), respiratory motion artifacts (3 %), prominent colonic <b>haustrations</b> (8. 5 %), prominent ileocecal valve (4. 5 %), prominent appendicular stump (0. 5 %) and false pits due to shine-through (1. 5 %). 3 D false negative results were proved secondary to fecal residue (1. 5 %), retained fluid (2. 5 %), colonic under-distention (5 %), prominent colonic folds (1 %) and sessile polyps (1 %). 2 D navigationThere were no false positive results. 3. 5 % false negative results were due to different combinations of fecal residue (3 %), fluid (2 %), under-distended colon (1 %), prominent colonic <b>haustrations</b> (2. 5 %) and sessile polyps (1 %). Finally, true positive results were proven in 40 % of 3 D and 47. 5 % of 2 D navigations, true negative: 29. 5 % in 3 D and 49 % 2 D. False positive results were proven in 19. 5 % of 3 D, false negative results: 11 % 3 D and 3. 5 % 2 D. 3 D 78. 4 %, 2 D 93 % sensitivity and 3 D 60. 2 % & 2 D 100 % specificity records. ConclusionMany overestimating or underestimating VC pitfalls could be avoided, through mastering the technique and being more familiar with different navigation methods and these technical pitfalls...|$|R
40|$|Face The Examiner:QUESTIONS 1. What are the {{diagnostic}} features of congenital pouch colon (CPC) ?Ans: A male patient with CPC {{often have a}} wide colovesical fistula and present with anorectal malformation and meconuria; on plain abdominal film, a single large bowel loop occupying more than 50 % of the abdominal cavity is also a diagnostic sign. Girls (persistent cloaca/vestibular fistula/anteriorly placed anus etc.) often present late with intractable constipation or multiple episodes of enterocolitis and persistent abdominal distension with common cloaca or anterior ectopic anus/ rectovestibular fistula. The congenital pouch colon can be identified as replacement of a part or entire colon in the configuration of pouch that lacks taenia coli, <b>haustrations,</b> appendices epiploicae, abnormal blood supply and a wide fistula with genitourinary system in a patient of anorectal malformation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Ischemic colitis is {{very rare}} in our country; there are {{difficulties}} in diagnosis and surgical treatment, and the late diagnosis in advanced cases causes {{a high rate of}} fatalities. Case. A 73 -year old woman presented with melena, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Laboratory evaluation revealed a WBC of 20, 900 /mm 3, glicaemia of 194 mg/dl, without other abnormalities. Plain abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a rubbery hard colon, without the normal aspect of <b>haustrations,</b> feeling like a parenchimatous organ, from the left colic angle to the recto-sigmoid jonction. The dissection of the origin of the inferior mezenteric artery proved its complete thrombosis. We performed a left colectomy with terminal colostomy on the transverse colon. Postoperative course was uneventful. Nine months after the first operation, we restored the continuity of the digestive tract by a colo-rectal anastomosis, without any problems...|$|R
40|$|Recent technologic {{advances}} have greatly improved {{the quality of}} abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by allowing the identification of abnormalities in inflammatory bowel disease. Thus far, the role of MRI has been extensively investigated in Crohn disease (CD) and, to a minor extent, in ulcerative colitis (UC), likely due to intrinsic differences between these two diseases. In UC the inflammatory lesions, unlike CD, are confined to the colon, have a predictable spreading, and affect only the inner wall layer; thus endoscopy alone can assess the extent and severity of disease in most cases. However, preliminary {{studies have demonstrated that}} MRI also can be a reliable diagnostic tool for UC because it is useful for integrating clinical and endoscopic data. MRI can be valuable in distinguishing CD from UC in uncertain cases by assessing the sparing of the distal ileum and the continuity of colonic involvement. Moreover, MRI can provide important information if endoscopy is incomplete, e. g., due to tight strictures, or contraindicated, e. g., in severely acute disease, due to a high risk of perforation. MRI can detect most of the typical findings of the diseases, such as wall thickening, mural stratification, loss of <b>haustrations,</b> and several complications including fibrotic or neoplastic strictures. In addition, MRI can be extremely valuable in assessing disease activity by monitoring the degree of wall gadolinium enhancement and T 2 signal {{at the level of the}} affected bowel segments, thus influencing pharmacologic and surgical planning. In the next few years, MRI will likely become the imaging modality of choice in the clinical management of this disease...|$|R
