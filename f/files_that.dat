Level-1 data takes 1–3 days to process, and the user will receive multiple <b>files</b> <b>that</b> they can then piece together to generate an RGB image.

5|$|One {{copy of the}} Protocol with {{circulated}} {{minutes of}} the meeting survived the war. It was found by Robert Kempner in March 1947 among <b>files</b> <b>that</b> had been seized from the German Foreign Office. It was used as evidence in the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a Holocaust memorial.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project <b>files,</b> <b>that</b> Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose {{that there}} is a {{compression}} algorithm <b>that</b> transforms every <b>file</b> into an output <b>file</b> <b>that</b> is no longer than the original <b>file,</b> and <b>that</b> at least one file will be compressed into an output <b>file</b> <b>that</b> is shorter than the original file.|$|R

5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab <b>files</b> <b>that</b> he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of tenants in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy <b>files</b> <b>that</b> tenants had on their floors.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual <b>files</b> <b>that</b> {{appear in the}} other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E
50|$|A {{property}} list (plist) {{is a type}} of <b>file</b> <b>that</b> launchd uses for program configuration. When launchd scans a folder, or a job is submitted with launchctl, it reads a plist <b>file</b> <b>that</b> describes how the program is to be run.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company <b>files</b> <b>that</b> tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text <b>files</b> <b>that</b> would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E

25|$|The ZIP {{file format}} is a data {{compression}} and file archiver. A ZIP file contains {{one or more}} <b>files</b> <b>that</b> have been compressed to reduce file size, or stored as-is.

25|$|Some schema {{languages}} {{not only}} describe {{the structure of}} a particular XML format but also offer limited facilities to influence processing of individual XML <b>files</b> <b>that</b> conform to this format.
