25|$|The {{planetary}} {{core of the}} IIABs {{was rich}} in sulfur and phosphorus. This special chemical composition caused the magma to split into two separate liquids while cooling. The concentration of sulfur is estimated to have been about 5%. For this reason the metallic magma reached the liquidus curve (a point where solids coexist with a liquid) of the iron + liquid field. This led to the crystallization of the IIAB meteorites. The remaining liquid was trapped in cavities of the IIABs and crystallized once the temperature reached the <b>eutectic</b> <b>point.</b> At this temperature the remaining magma crystallized schreibersite and iron, thereby forming the IIG meteorites.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{attribute of}} cocrystals {{is that their}} properties can be tailored to meet required solubility and stability specifications. But before such practical uses can be realized, {{a better understanding of}} the factors that dictate co-crystal behavior is needed. This study attempts to explain the phase behavior of anhydrous/hydrated cocrystals when the coformer modulates both water activity and co-crystal solubility. Stability dependence on solution composition and water activity was studied for theophylline–citric acid (THP–CTA) anhydrous and hydrated cocrystals by both suspension and vapor equilibration methods. <b>Eutectic</b> <b>points</b> and associated water activities were measured by suspension equilibration methods to determine stability regions and phase diagrams. The critical water activity for the anhydrous–hydrate co-crystal was found to be 0. 8. It is shown that (a) both water and coformer activities determine phase stability, and (b) excipients that alter water activity can profoundly affect the hydrate/anhydrous <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> and phase stability. Vapor phase stability studies demonstrate that cocrystals of highly water soluble coformers, such as citric acid, are predisposed to conversions due to moisture uptake and deliquescence of the coformer. The presence of such coformers as trace level impurities with co-crystal will alter hygroscopic behavior and stability. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 99 : 3977 – 3985, 201...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{influences}} of high magnetic field (up to 12 T) on the morphology of Pb-Sn and Al-Al 2 Cu lamellar eutectics during directional solidification were investigated. The experimental results indicate that, {{along with a}} decrease in eutectic spacing, the banded structure forms at lower growth speeds under high magnetic field and the band spacing decreases as the magnetic field increases. Moreover, {{the application of a}} magnetic field enriches the Cu solute in the liquid ahead of the liquid/solid interface during directional solidification of an Al-Al 2 Cu eutectic alloy. The effects of high magnetic field on the <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> of non-ferromagnetic alloys and the stress acting on the eutectic lamellae during directional solidification have been studied. Both thermodynamic evaluation and DTA measurements reveal that the high magnetic field has a negligible effect on the <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> of non-ferromagnetic alloys. However, the high magnetic field caused an increase of the nucleation temperature and undercooling. The numerical results indicate that a considerable stress is produced on the eutectic lamellae during directional solidification under high magnetic field. The formation of a banded structure in a lamellar eutectic during directional solidification under high magnetic field may be attributed to both the buildup of the solute in the liquid ahead of the liquid/solid interface and the stress acting on the eutectic lamellae...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical cocrystals have {{generated}} enormous interest {{due to their}} potential for improving the physicochemical shortcomings of a drug, such as poor aqueous solubility. Poor aqueous solubility can compromise drug performance and cocrystallization is an emerging strategy to design materials with desirable properties. This approach is currently limited because cocrystal solution chemistry remains largely unexplored. This dissertation explores the influence of two critically important solution phase interactions, ionization and micellar solubilization, on cocrystal solubility and stability. 	The objectives of this work are to (1) understand the effect of ionization on cocrystal solubility, (2) investigate the role of micellar solubilization on cocrystal solubility and stability, (3) develop mathematical models to describe cocrystal solubility and stability via ionization and micellar solubilization equilibria, and (4) understand how ionization and micellar solubilization affect cocrystal <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> and regions of thermodynamic stability. 	Cocrystal solubility, stability, and <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> were investigated {{as a function of}} pH and sodium lauryl sulfate concentration for a series of carbamazepine cocrystals in water. The cocrystals represented two stoichiometries (1 : 1 and 2 : 1) and four coformers (salicylic acid, saccharin, 4 -aminobenzoic acid, and succinic acid) with various ionization properties. Mathematical models for cocrystal solubility were developed in terms of experimentally accessible thermodynamic parameters based on cocrystal dissociation, component ionization, and micellar solubilization. These models demonstrated that cocrystal solubility relative to drug could be strongly dependent on surfactant concentration and pH, and that the thermodynamic stability of cocrystals could be controlled via predictable parameters called the critical stabilization concentration (CSC) and pHmax. This enabled {{for the first time the}} thermodynamic stabilization of cocrystals that would otherwise be unstable in water under stoichiometric solution conditions. Several methods were developed to evaluate CSC and were challenged by the carbamazepine cocrystals. The important factors that affect CSC and pHmax were identified as (1) cocrystal aqueous solubility relative to drug, (2) micellar solubilization constants and acid dissociation constants for the cocrystal components, (3) cocrystal stoichiometry, and (4) surfactant CMC. The mathematical models demonstrated excellent predictive capacity in describing the influence of pH and surfactant concentration on cocrystal solubility, CSC, and <b>eutectic</b> <b>points</b> for the carbamazepine cocrystals...|$|R
