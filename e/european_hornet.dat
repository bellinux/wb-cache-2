25|$|The <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> {{is a true}} hornet (genus Vespa), a group {{characterized}} by eusocial species. The genus is in the subfamily Vespinae, which is known for chewing up their food to feed it to their young as well as chewing up paper-like materials to make their nests. According to a recent phylogenetic study, its closest relative is Vespa dybowski.|$|E
25|$|Unwarranted fear of V. crabro {{has often}} {{led to the}} {{destruction}} of nests. This has led to the decline of the species, which is often locally threatened or even endangered. European hornets benefit from legal protection in some countries, notably Germany, where it has been illegal to kill a <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> or nest since January 1, 1987, with a fine up to €50,000.|$|E

25|$|As the name, <b>European</b> <b>hornet,</b> implies, V. crabro used to {{be found}} only in Eurasia. Nests ranged from Japan to the United Kingdom. However, Saussure {{reported}} that V. crabro was introduced to North America in the mid-19th century, {{and it is now}} well-established. More recently in 2010, they were found to have also made their way into Guatemala. The few nests found in Guatemala were thought to be introduced accidentally, rather recently, since these were the first documented occurrences.|$|E
25|$|The <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa crabro) is {{the largest}} eusocial wasp in Europe and the largest vespine in North America. It is {{actually}} the only true hornet found in North America. V. crabro is usually regarded as a pest by those humans who {{come into contact with}} it. Vespines, like V. crabro, are known for making nests out of surrounding plant materials and other fibers to create intricate paper nests. Unlike most other vespines, reproductive suppression involves worker policing instead of queen pheromone control as was previously thought.|$|E
25|$|Species of {{the order}} Hymenoptera {{typically}} {{communicate with each other}} through behaviors or chemical excretions. In the <b>European</b> <b>hornet,</b> a typical alarm dance is performed outside of the nest and consists of consistent buzzing, darting {{in and out of the}} nest, and attacking or approaching the target of the alarm pheremone. V. crabro has internal venomous sacs, some of which contain pheromones that are secreted in response to alarm. Experiments determined that 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol is the main component which causes V. crabro to express this defensive behavior. Other pentenols and pentanols are contained within these venomous sacs, but their primary purpose is not to warn fellow hornets that there is danger nearby, because these chemicals did not induce any alarm behavior.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} progresses, the colony changes its style of obtaining food {{for both the}} larvae and adults. In April, when the queen {{normally}} lays her eggs, the workers actively go out and forage. However, typically around the fall season, a change is observed in the colony as the foraging workers turn into scavengers. Instead of putting forth the effort to find food sources, the workers try to take what is more easily available. For example, <b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> have been seen hovering around garbage cans and picnic areas in the fall.|$|R
50|$|Adult eastern cicada-killer wasps are large, 1.5 to 5.0 cm long, robust wasps with hairy, reddish {{and black}} {{areas on the}} thorax (middle part), and are black to reddish brown marked with light yellow stripes on the {{abdominal}} (rear) segments. The wings are brownish. Coloration superficially resembles that of some yellowjacket and hornet species. The females are somewhat larger than the males, and both are among the largest wasps seen in the Eastern United States, their unusual size giving them a uniquely fearsome appearance. <b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> (Vespa crabro) are often mistaken for Eastern cicada killers.|$|R
25|$|This species stings in {{response}} to being stepped on or grabbed, but generally avoids conflict. It is also defensive of its hive and can be aggressive around food sources. <b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> are carnivorous and hunt large insects such as beetles, wasps, large moths, dragonflies and mantises. However, mutual predation between medium-sized hornets and robberfly (Asilidae) is often reported. Care should be taken when they are encountered in these circumstances, as they may sting without warning. The pain from the sting may persist for several days with attendant swelling. Victims may wish to seek medical attention {{in case of an}} allergic reaction.|$|R
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a <b>European</b> <b>hornet,</b> he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
500|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Hornet,</b> Vespa crabro, was {{previously}} {{thought to be}} under reproductive pheromone control by the queen, thus explaining why the other females didn't reproduce, {{even though they were}} capable of doing so. [...] Experiments by Foster showed that the workers were instead regulating sterility in each other, thus instead exhibiting worker policing. [...] While each worker is capable of reproducing, the colony as a whole is more efficient and organized if the workers allow only the queen to lay larvae.|$|E
2500|$|The eyes of V. crabro {{are deeply}} {{indented}} and {{shaped like a}} [...] "C". Its wings are reddish-orange, while the petiolate abdomen is striped with brown and yellow. It has hair on the thorax and abdomen, although the <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> is not as hairy as most bees. Typical mass size for the <b>European</b> <b>Hornet</b> is 477.5+/-59.9mg. Due to this coloration and abdomen pattern, V. crabro is often mistaken for the Asian giant hornet. In size, the <b>European</b> <b>hornet,</b> at 25–35mm long, {{is larger than the}} common wasp, but smaller than the Asian giant hornet. Females are typically larger than males in both size and mass. However, male abdomens have seven segments, whereas female abdomens have six. Only females possess an ovipositor (modified to form a stinger), and males cannot sting. The antennae of males are slightly longer, with 13 segments compared to 12 segments in females.|$|E
25|$|<b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> {{have been}} given a {{reputation}} for being very aggressive. Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the yellow garden spider Argiope aurantia. Davis observed the hornets in Georgia fly into the spider’s web and appear entangled. Looking closer, the hornet was cutting free prey that had been caught by the spider’s web. The spider did not attack or interfere with V. crabro as it was stealing its prey. This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a garbage can, which is why they are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|R

40|$|Introduction <b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> (Vespa crabro, Vespinae) are cavity nesting eusocial wasps with {{an annual}} life cycle. Mated gynes overwinter and found new nests in the spring. In the spring and early summer, V. c r a b r o colonies produce only workers with a maximum of c. 300 [...] 400 workers {{at the peak of}} colony {{development}} (unpubl. obs.). Male and female sexuals were produced in late summer and in autumn and leave their maternal nests without orientation flights (unpublished observations). Captive breeding of social insects is an important research technique, but previous attempts to do this with hornets have failed (e. g. V. affinis; Martin, 1993). Similarly, other vespine wasps are difficult to rear under controlled conditions (Edwards, 1980). Here we report the successful completion of a V. crabro colony life cycle in captivity.

40|$|Hornets, {{the largest}} social wasps, have a {{reputation}} of being facultatively nocturnal. Here we confirm flight activity of hornet workers in dim twilight. We studied the eyes and ocelli of <b>European</b> <b>hornets</b> (Vespa crabro) and common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) with the goal to find the optical and anatomical adaptations {{that enable them to}} fly in dim light. Adaptations described for obligately nocturnal hymenoptera such as the bees Xylocopa tranquebarica and Megalopta genalis and the wasp Apoica pallens include large ocelli and compound eyes with wide rhabdoms and large facet lenses. Interestingly, we did not find any such adaptations in hornet eyes or ocelli. On the contrary, their eyes are even less sensitive than those of the obligately diurnal common wasps. Therefore we conclude that hornets, like several facultatively nocturnal bee species such as Apis mellifera adansonii, A. dorsata and X. tenuiscapa are capable of seeing in dim light simply due to the large body and thus eye size. We propose that neural pooling strategies and behavioural adaptations precede anatomical adaptations in the eyes and ocelli when insects with apposition compound eyes turn to dim light activity...|$|R

50|$|Hornets {{are found}} {{mainly in the}} Northern Hemisphere. The common <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa crabro) is the best-known species, widely {{distributed}} in Europe (but is never found north of the 63rd parallel), in North China and also the only species introduced to North America, Ukraine and European Russia (except in extreme northern areas).

The common <b>European</b> <b>hornet</b> was accidentally introduced to North America about the middle of the 19th century, and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe.
