5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished.

5|$|Bellevue's {{history of}} skyscrapers {{began with the}} {{completion}} of the Paccar Tower in 1970; this structure is regarded as the city's first high-rise. <b>High-rise</b> <b>building</b> construction remained slow until 1982, when the city's first skyscraper building boom took shape. Eight of the city's 24 tallest buildings were completed within the next seven years, including City Center Bellevue, which was the tallest building in Bellevue for almost two decades. The skyscraper construction boom ended in 1989, and subsequently only one high-rise which ranked among the city's tallest structures was completed in the 1990s. Beginning in 2000, Bellevue entered into a second, much larger building boom that continued to 2010. More than half of Bellevue's twenty tallest buildings were completed after 2000; nine projects were completed in 2008 alone, including Bellevue Towers. Overall, Bellevue's skyline is ranked third in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, after Seattle and Portland.|$|E
5|$|The Downtown Triangle {{includes}} two hotels. Kikar Zion Hotel (Zion Square Hotel), which faces Zion Square from the south, occupies {{the site of}} the former Zion Cinema that gave the square its name. The cinema was demolished in 1972 and a <b>high-rise</b> <b>building</b> containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected. As of 2016, the hotel is being renovated for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. On the northern side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel. Menachem Begin stood on one of the hotel's balconies on 3 August 1948, to announce the dissolution of the Irgun and the sign-up of his soldiers with the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E

5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} Floor Area Ratio limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968.

A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese asset price bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E

40|$|Lateral loading due to wind or {{earthquake}} is a {{major factor}} that affects the design of <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings.</b> This paper highlights the problems associated with the seismic design of <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> in regions of strong wind and moderate seismicity. Seismic response analysis and performance evaluation were conducted for wind-designed concentrically braced steel <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> in order to check the feasibility of designing them per elastic seismic design criterion (or strength and stiffness solution) in such regions. Review of wind design and pushover analysis results indicated that wind-designed <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> possess significantly increased elastic seismic capacity due to the overstrength resulting from the wind serviceability criterion. The strength demand-to-capacity study showed that, due to the wind design overstrength, <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> with a slenderness ratio of larger than four or five can elastically withstand even the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) with the seismic performance level of immediate occupancy under the limited conditions of this study.

40|$|The {{resonant}} behaviour of base-isolated <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> under long-period ground motions is investigated. The long-period ground motions {{are known}} to be induced by surface waves. While the acceleration amplitude of such long-period ground motion is small, the velocity amplitude is fairly large. It is expected that <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> and base-isolated buildings with long fundamental natural periods are greatly influenced by these long-period ground motions. Especially base-isolated <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> with friction-type bearings may have remarkable mechanical characteristics unfavourable for these long-period ground motions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal that the long-period ground motions recorded in Japan have the intensity to make base-isolated <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> in resonance with long-period components and that careful treatment is inevitable in the structural design of these base-isolated <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings.</b> It is pointed out that the friction-type bearings are effective in general in avoiding the resonance with ground motions with a narrow-range frequency characteristic, but are dangerous for ground motions with a wide-range frequency characteristic in the long period range.

40|$|Critical {{infrastructures}} {{are becoming}} more complex and interconnected, increasing their vulnerability to different types of disruptors. Infrastructure systems in large cities in developing countries are experiencing the consequences of rapid urban growth, including {{the increasing number of}} <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> to provide space in areas where the areas for new developments are limited. In addition, deficient urban planning procedures to provide appropriate infrastructure capacities to satisfy the high demand of resources from the new buildings affect the performance of critical infrastructures. The problem is exacerbated due to insufficient investment for rehabilitation and repair and construction of new infrastructures, and existing infrastructures have no alternative but to continue operating at close to their design capacity. These factors combined with the presence of <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> can be considered non-physical disruptors of critical infrastructures. ^ This research first demonstrates how the impacts of non-physical disruptors on the performance of critical infrastructures can be evaluated in physical terms and demonstrates this evaluation by investigating the impacts of <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> on the performance of the electric and transportation infrastructures in developing countries. Additionally, it explores interdependencies between the electric and transportation infrastructures. ^ This research utilizes the user equilibrium approach to assess the effect of additional trips generated by <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> on the performance of the transportation infrastructure. A system dynamics model is used to evaluate the effects of additional electricity consumption from <b>high-rise</b> <b>buildings,</b> in the performance of the electric infrastructure.
