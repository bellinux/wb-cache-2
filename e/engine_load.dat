25|$|Search engines such as Google {{serves as}} a default means {{of access to the}} Web and its wide array of {{linguistics}} resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{possibility of}} applying {{the theory of}} semi-Markov processes for probabilistic description of load spectrum for diesel engines employed for ship propulsion, so for main engines. The considerations include output power characteristics {{for this kind of}} engines. The characteristics have enabled formulating a four-member set of states of the process of <b>load</b> on the <b>engines.</b> The theory of semi-Markov processes has been applied for describing the real process of loads on the mentioned engines. This theory has made possible building a model of the <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> in form of a continuous-time semi-Markov process with a four-state set of values. Properties of a Darboux continuous function, which allow considering the <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> as the discrete-states and continuous-time processes, have been used to build the model. In consequence a limiting distribution of the occurring process of successive states of <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> could be determined. The distribution is the probabilities of staying a sea-going ship main engine in successive states of load. The distribution is characterized by the spectrum of loads on this kind of engines. The presented model can be developed by taking into account many states of the process of main <b>engines</b> <b>loading</b> as the need is to make such a probabilistic description of the process that provides possibility of rational control of the operating process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{efficiency}} of tractors applied in agriculture is usually estimated as an integrated value including the indices of their intensive and extensive utilisation. The application intensity of tractors and machines {{is characterized by}} their working capacity per unit of time An important factor in fuel consumption is the <b>engine</b> <b>loading.</b> The presented generalised curves of the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> show in percentage the variations in {{the values of the}} indices characterising the operation of the engine: the total fuel consumption, the torsional moment (the moment of rotation), the number of crankshaft revolutions and the specific fuel consumption depending on the effective power developed by the engine (also in percentage). If the <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> falls, the specific fuel consumption rises, at first, at a slower rate (up to about 80 % loading), but further it increases more and more rapidly. As a result of conducted theoretical investigations, carried out in the Research Institute of Agricultural Machinery at the Latvia University of Agriculture in years 2007 - 2008, the intermediate regularities of the energetical parameters of the tractor engines are determined. These regularities mathematicaly interface the energetical indices of the tractor disel engines. It follows from this that the ratio of the <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> may be determined by measuring the fuel consumption in a corresponding moment of time, the data saved in the data logger, and their interpretation using an appropriate computer programme.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the combined application of fumigation methanol and a diesel oxidation catalyst for reducing emissions of an in-use diesel engine. Experiments were performed on a 4 -cylinder naturally-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine operating at a constant speed of 1800  rev/min for five <b>engine</b> <b>loads.</b> The experimental results show that at low <b>engine</b> <b>loads,</b> the brake thermal efficiency decreases with increase in fumigation methanol; but at high loads, it slightly increases with increase in fumigation methanol. The fumigation method results in {{a significant increase in}} hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) emissions, but decrease in nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke opacity and the particulate mass concentration. For the submicron particles, the total number of particles decreases. In all cases, there is little change in geometrical mean diameter of the particles. After catalytic conversion, the HC, CO, NO 2, particulate mass and particulate number concentrations were significantly reduced at medium to high engine loads; while the geometrical mean diameter of the particles becomes larger. Thus, the combined use of fumigation methanol and diesel oxidation catalyst leads to a reduction of HC, CO, NOx, particulate mass and particulate number concentrations at medium to high <b>engine</b> <b>loads.</b> Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the conventional dual pressure steam Rankine cycle process and the organic Rankine cycle process for marine engine waste heat recovery. The comparison was based on a container vessel, and results are presented for a high-sulfur (3 wt %) and low-sulfur (0. 5 wt %) fuel case. The processes were compared based on their off-design performance for diesel <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> in the range between 25 % and 100 %. The fluids considered in the organic Rankine cycle process were MM(hexamethyldisiloxane), toluene, n-pentane, i-pentane and c-pentane. The results of the comparison indicate that the net power output of the steam Rankine cycle process is higher at high <b>engine</b> <b>loads,</b> while the performance of the organic Rankine cycle units is higher at lower loads. Preliminary turbine design considerations suggest that higher turbine efficiencies can be obtained for the ORC unit turbines compared to the steam turbines. When the efficiency of the c-pentane turbine was allowed to be 10 % points larger than the steam turbine efficiency, the organic Rankine cycle unit reaches higher net power outputs than the steam Rankine cycle unit at all <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> for the low-sulfur fuel case. The net power production from the waste heat recovery units is generally higher for the low-sulfur fuel case.
