5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> darkness.|$|E

Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> subfreezing {{temperatures}} with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
50|$|A {{re-entry}} permit {{is required}} by some countries, for their citizens or tourists who leave the country for an <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. For example, the United States issues a re-entry permit to a resident alien who plans to travel abroad for an <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time (up to two years) while maintaining their permanent residency.|$|R

Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association {{to care for the}} poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E

5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs {{because most of the}} region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> drought are uncommon, and much of the region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E

5|$|The San Juan National Weather Service office {{issued a}} flood watch {{for all of}} Puerto Rico, {{including}} the islands of Culebra and Vieques. <b>Extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> heavy rainfall also resulted in flash flood warnings for portions across the island. Ferry service between Fajardo and the islands of Culebra and Vieques was temporarily suspended during {{the passage of the}} storm. In the Dominican Republic, officials opened shelters in 15provinces, with citizens in low-lying areas recommended to stay elsewhere during the passage of the storm; citizens in 22communities were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. <b>Extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
