40|$|Eleven healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} a study {{comparing}} the effects of locally and systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists on the secretory response of sweat glands to intradermally injected carbachol chloride. Atropine sulphate administered locally into the skin antagonised the response to carbachol: the dose-response curve for carbachol was shifted to the right without any depression of the maximum of the curve. The nicotinic receptor antagonists <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> and (+) -tubocurarine chloride, however, {{had little effect on}} the response to carbachol. Atropine sulphate, administered systemically by intramuscular injection, caused a non-surmountable antagonism of the response to carbachol: the maximum of the dose-response curve was depressed with little change in the value of ED 50. Atropine methonitrate (a mixed muscarinic/nicotinic receptor antagonist), and <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (a nicotinic receptor antagonist), both with poor access to the central nervous system, were injected intramuscularly: both caused non-surmountable antagonism of the response to carbachol. It is concluded that the response to carbachol is mediated by muscarinic rather than nicotinic receptors. The effect of atropine sulphate on the response to carbachol depends on the route of administration: while locally applied atropine sulphate appears to act as a competitive antagonist, systemically applied atropine sulphate, like atropine methonitrate and <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> appears to act in a non-competitive manner. It is suggested that the systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists reduce the response to carbachol by interacting with cholinoceptors in sympathetic ganglia: such an interaction would reduce the impulse flow in sudomotor fibres resulting in decreased sensitivity of the sweat glands to carbachol...|$|E
40|$|The {{vasoconstrictor}} {{action of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{in the human}} placental preparation is about 10 times stronger than that of adrenaline and is antagonized by anti-adrenaline compounds like phentolamine. Both 5 -HT and adrenaline are antagonized by yohimbine and chlorpromazine. Specific and strong anti- 5 -HT action is demonstrated for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and tryptamine. Both LSD and tryptamine in larger doses have a vasoconstrictor action. Mescaline has no certain modifying effect on the action of 5 -HT, but itself causes vasoconstriction in large doses. The antihistamine drug phenbenzamine in histamine blocking doses abolishes the action of 5 -HT in half the preparations tested. The ganglionic blocking agent trimetaphan in large doses antagonizes the action of 5 -HT added subsequently, and also, to a lesser degree, the effect of adrenaline. <b>Hexamethonium</b> and tetraethylammonium <b>bromides</b> are ineffective in this preparation. No certain modifying action of reserpine on subsequently added 5 -HT could be demonstrated, and {{the same was true}} for heparin even in very high concentrations...|$|R

When sound rabbits are cut off vagic nerve or sulfuric atropine, urine volume increases, glomerular filtration rate decreases, effective renal plasma flow and effective renal blood flow increases, and filtration fraction decreases; and reabsorpion rate decreases, and tubular excretory mass increases. Acetylcholine being given, {{the result will be}} contrary to the above. 2. When sound rabbits are cut off splanchinic nerve, urine volume increases remarkably, glomerular filtration rate decreases, effective renal plasma flow and effective renal blood flow increase remarkably, and filtration fraction decreases remarkably; and reabsorption rate decrcases fairly and tubular excretory mass increases considerably. 3. When sound rabbits are given <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> urine volume decreases, glomerular filtration rate decreases, effective renal plasma flow and effective renal blood flow increases. and filtration fraction decreases, reabsorption rate increses and tubular excretory mass decreases. 4. When sound rabbits are given sulfuric adrenalin at the proportion of 0. 1 mg per kilogram of body weight, it is only filtration fraction that decreases, and the others increases to some respective extents. When given the same at the proportion of 0. 5 mg., the result will be quite contrary. 5. When the rabbits subjectd to a ligature of common bile duct are cut off vagic nerve, urine volume decreases, glomerular filtration rate decreases, effective renal plasma flow and effective renal blood flow increase, and filtration fraction decreases; reabsorption rate and tubular excretory mass increase. When sulfuric atropine is given the result will be similar to the above, excepting only that reabsorption rate decreases. 6. When the rabbits {{subjected to a}} ligaure of common bile duct are given acetylcholine, the result will be quite the same as the case of sulfuric atropine, only with the exception that urine volume decreases. 7.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of traces of metallo-cyanide complexes by capillary zone electrophoresis is described. The suitability of preconcentration procedures based on supported liquid membranes in a flow system is investigated. Methyltrioctylammonium chloride in dibutyl ether is used as the active component of the membrane liquid. Due to ion-pairing mechanisms enrichment factors ranging from 50 to 600 can be achieved for cyanide complexes of Fe(II), Fe(III), Ni, Co, Pd, Pt, Cr, Au and Ag. The final capillary electrophoretic separation of the metallo-cyanides is performed off-line with a phosphate-triethanolamine buffer at pH 8. 5 as the carrier electrolyte.

40|$|The results {{presented}} here {{are consistent with}} the hypothesis that histamine is the major neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors of locust ocelli. 1. When histamine is injected by ionophoresis into the locust ocellar neuropile, large second-order neurones (L-neurones) hyperpolarize in a dose-dependent manner, and responses to light in these neurones are diminished in amplitude. Both histamine and the illumination of ocellar photoreceptors caused an outward current across the membrane. 2. Hyperpolarizing potentials in L-neurones evoked by histamine had the same reversal potential as hyperpolarizing potentials evoked by photoreceptor illumi-nation. 3. When applied ionophoretically in the ocellus, other biogenic amines, including octopamine, dopamine and noradrenaline, had no effect on the L-neurones. Both gamma-aminobutyricacid and acetylcholine, however, depolar-ized L-neurones and diminished responses to light. 4. Curare blocked the L-neurone's responses to histamine and light.

40|$|Electrophysiological and {{histological}} {{techniques were}} used to study {{the nature of the}} innervation of the colon by the sacral parasympathetic nerve of the dog. Many cells which incorporate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were observed in ganglia of the pelvic plexus, but not in the sacral cord, after HRP was injected into the wall of the distal colon. Stimulation of the pelvic ganglia by an application of dimethylphenylpiperazinium contracted the distal colon. The contraction was reduced by nicotine applied to the colon. Compound action potentials in responses of rectal strands of the pelvic nerve to stimulation of the sacral ventral roots decreased or disappeared after <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (C 6) was applied to the pelvic plexus. Conduction velocities of the potentials showed that most of the preganglionic fibres were B fibres, and nearly all the post-ganglionic fibres were C fibres. Many C fibres were observed by electron microscopy in the rectal strands after degeneration of the pelvic and hypogastric nerves. Stimulation of such rectal strands caused a contraction of the colon, which diminished after C 6 was applied to the distal colon.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that in certain cases of mitral {{stenosis}} the pulmonary arterial pressure may be disproportionately high. More recently {{it has been shown that}} this pressure, which is due to an increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, may rise still further on effort (Bayliss et al., 1950; Eliasch et al., 1952). There is considerable debate as to the mechanism and significance of this increase in pulmonary vascular resistance for, as the author of a recent annotation in the Lancet remarked, " it is not fully understood. " In view of its theoretical and practical importance we decided to reinvestigate this problem with especial reference to the role of the autonomic nervous system.

Phenylephrine and epinephrine {{increased the number of}} spike bursts in the sphincter of Oddi after a short period of stimulation. No spike potentials were seen in the duodenum after infusion of norepinephrine. Clonidine and dobutamine decreased spike burst activity in the sphincter of Oddi and duodenum. Terbutaline also decreased the frequency of spike bursts in the sphincter of Oddi but did not change the number in the duodenum. Prior infusion of antagonists blocked partially or totally the effect of all respective agonists except for yohimbine, which did not inhibit the effect of clonidine. These findings suggest that the sphincter of Oddi may have cholinergic, alpha 1, alpha 1, beta 1 and beta 2 -adrenergic receptors.

Accordingly, we have performed a three part {{study in which}} we have compared the invivo pressor, chronotropic, and inotropic responses (Part 1 and Part 2) to an open loop selective carotid baroreceptor unloading by performing transient bilateral carotid occlusion (TBCO) in anesthetized mice, and (Part 3) in vitro myocyte responses to isoproterenol between mice exposed to hind-limb unweighting (HLU) for ~ 2 weeks and controls. In part 1, we developed a common protocol in which we bilaterally exposed the carotid sinus regions to separate carotid artery, vagus, aortic depressor nerves (ADN) and sympathetic trunk (ST). We measured HR and MAP responses to TBCO in several groups of mice. In controls (C), TBCO increased heart rate (HR; 15 ± 2 bpm, P< 0. 05) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; 17 ± 2 mmHg, P< 0. 05).

Hypertension was induced by intraperitoneal infusion of angiotensin II (125 ng/min) for 12 days via miniosmotic pump. High dietary intake of sodium chloride significantly augmented the angiotensin II-induced hypertension (mean blood pressure on day 13, 165 ± 6 versus 142 ± 6 mm Hg,/?< 0. 05), but equimolar sodium loading provided as sodium citrate failed to enhance angiotensin II hypertension (140 ± 6 mm Hg). Plasma norepinephrine concentration in the conscious, resting state increased with sodium chloride loading in angiotensin II-infused rats (594 ± 42 versus 312 ± 37 pg/ml,p< 0. 01), but it remained unchanged with sodium citrate loading (324 ± 23 pg/ml).

40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from cells in vitro in the inferior mesenteric ganglia of the cat. Neurones could be classified into three types: non-spontaneous, irregular discharging and regular discharging neurones. Non-spontaneous neurones had a stable resting membrane potential and responded with action potentials to indirect preganglionic nerve stimulation and to intracellular injection of depolarizing current. Irregular discharging neurones were characterized by a discharge of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s.) which sometimes gave rise to action potentials. This activity was abolished by <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> chlorisondamine and d-tubocurarine chloride. Tetrodotoxin and a low Ca 2 + -high Mg 2 + solution also blocked on-going activity in irregular discharging neurones. Regular discharging neurones were characterized by a rhythmic discharge of action potentials. Each action potential was preceded by a gradual depolarization of the intracellularly recorded membrane potential. Intracellular injection of hyperpolarizing current abolished the regular discharge of action potential. No synaptic potentials were observed during hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Nicotinic, muscarinic and adrenergic receptor blocking drugs did not modify the discharge of action potentials in regular discharging neurones. A low Ca 2 + -high Mg 2 + solution also {{had no effect on}} the regular discharge of action potentials. Interpolation of an action potential between spontaneous action potentials in regular discharging neurones reset the rhythm of discharge.

The relationship between the disappearance of electrical synaptic connectivity {{and the appearance of}} chemical neurotransmission is not well understood. We report here that identified motoneurons from the snail Helisoma formed transient electrical and chemical connections during regeneration both in vivo and in vitro. Electrical connections that formed in vivo were strongest by day 2 and no longer detectable by day 7. During elimination of this electrical connection, an inhibitory chemical connection from 110 onto 19 formed. This sequence of synaptic development was recapitulated in cell culture with a similar time course. The relationship between the appearance of transient electrical coupling and its possible effects on the subsequent chemical synaptogenesis were examined by reducing transient intercellular coupling. Trophic factor-deprived medium resulted in a 66 % reduction in coupling coefficient. In these conditions, the unidirectional chemical connection formed readily; in contrast, chemical synaptogenesis was delayed in cell pairs exposed to trophic factors where transient electrical coupling was strong. Dye coupling and synaptic vesicle cycling studies supported electrophysiological results. Exposure to cholinergic antagonists, curare and <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> which block chemical neurotransmission in these synapses, resulted in prolonged maintenance of the electrical connection. These studies demonstrated an inverse relationship between chemical and electrical connectivity at early stages of synaptic development and suggest a dynamic interaction between these forms of neuronal communication as adult neural networks are constructed or regenerated.

40|$|Increased {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} activity has been demonstrated in established one-kidney one-clip hypertension in the rat. We have found that renal denervation in this model results in an attenuation of hypertension, unassociated with alterations in sodium or water balance or renin activity. To determine whether the depressor effect of renal denervation is associated with changes in peripheral {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity, sham operation (n = 12), renal denervation (n = 13), or unclipping (n = 13) was carried out 2 wk after the onset of one-kidney one-clip hypertension. Normotensive unine-phrectomized age- and sex-matched rats were used as controls (n = 14). Renal denervation resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} systolic blood pressure (201 ± 7 to 151 ± 6 mm Hg), while unclipping lowered systolic blood pressure to normotensive levels (130 ± 6 mm Hg). 8 d after operation plasma norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure before and after ganglionic blockade with 30 mg/kg <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> were measured in conscious, unrestrained, resting animals, as indices of peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly higher in hypertensive sham-operated rats (422 ± 42 pg/ml) compared with normotensive controls (282 ± 25 pg/ml) (P < 0. 01). Both renal denervation and unclipping restored plasma norepinephrine to normal levels (273 ± 22 and 294 ± 24 pg/ml, respectively). Ganglionic blockade in hypertensive sham-operated animals resulted in a significantly greater decrease in mean arterial pressure than occurred in renal denervated, unclipped, or control rats. The data suggest that the depressor effect of renal denervation or unclipping in the one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rat is associated with a decrease in peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} i. v. {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) on regional blood flow, vascular resistance, {{heart rate and}} cardiac output in cats were studied using the microsphere method. Three series of experiments were performed. In the first there was no pre-treatment of the animals. In the second the animals were pre-treated with indomethacin (5 mg kg- 1) {{in order to prevent}} the formation of prostaglandins. In the third series the ganglionic blocking agent <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (80 mg kg- 1) was given in order to prevent autonomic reflexes. CGRP was given as an i. v. infusion. Two doses were tested in each series. Animals with no pre-treatment and those pre-treated with indomethacin received first 60 pmol kg- 1 infused over a 5 -min period and then 180 pmol kg- 1 infused over a 3 -min period. Animals under ganglionic blockade received the same dose as the total infusions in the other series (240 pmol kg- 1) infused over 4 min and a second infusion of 1. 2 nmol kg- 1 over 5 min. Vasodilatory effects were observed in most of the tissues tested, but there were marked differences in sensitivity. The most sensitive tissues seemed to be the lacrimal, submandibular and parotid glands, the nictitating membrane, the tongue and the gallbladder. The patterns of sensitivity were similar in all the series, indicating that neither prostaglandins nor autonomic reflexes were involved in the effects. In experiments with animals under ganglionic blockade, an increase in blood pressure, concomitant with an increase in heart rate, was seen 5 min after the infusions ended. Thus, {{it is likely that the}} peptide exerts a direct positive chronotropic effect on the feline heart...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor of the alpha 4 /non-alpha (alpha 4 /n alpha) type was reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes after nuclear injection of cDNA expression vectors. Functional neuronal receptor was only formed when the two subunits alpha 4 and n alpha were coinjected, neither alpha 4 nor n alpha alone being effective. Responses to bath application of acetylcholine (AcCho) have been measured in voltage clamp. AcCho doses as low as 10 nM induce currents of up to 50 nA. Dose-response studies indicate a Kd of about 0. 77 x 10 (- 6) M and a Hill coefficient of 1. 5, thus predicting more than one AcCho binding site per receptor molecule. The current-voltage relationship of AcCho-induced currents presents a strong inward rectification. Responses to AcCho were compared to those of three other agonists: L-nicotine, carbachol, and 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). Sensitivities to AcCho, nicotine, and DMPP are quite similar. Sensitivity to carbachol is much lower, but the currents are otherwise indistinguishable from those induced by AcCho. Five AcCho antagonists [...] neuronal bungarotoxin (kappa-bungarotoxin), tubocurarine (TC), <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Hex), decamethonium bromide (Dec), and mecamylamine (Mec) [...] have been tested. Neuronal bungarotoxin {{has no effect on}} the alpha 4 /n alpha channel, whereas 2. 5 microM TC reduces by half the current peak evoked by 1 microM AcCho. The block by TC is independent of membrane voltage. By contrast, the block of AcCho-induced currents by Hex or Dec is strongly voltage dependent, suggesting that these substances enter the channel. The block by Mec is detectable at concentrations as low as 100 nM when applied together with 1 microM AcCho and is voltage independent. Hex, Dec, and Mec are effective only when AcCho is present. While the effects of all other agents are fully reversible, the Mec block is persistent...|$|E
40|$|Activation of pudendal afferents can evoke bladder {{contraction}} or relaxation {{dependent on the}} frequency of stimulation, but the mechanisms of reflex bladder excitation evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation are unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms to {{bladder contraction}}s evoked by stimulation of the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP) in α-chloralose anesthetized adult male cats. Bladder contractions were evoked by DNP stimulation only above a bladder volume threshold equal to 73 ± 12 % of the distension-evoked reflex contraction volume threshold. Bilateral hypogastric nerve transection (to eliminate sympathetic innervation of the bladder) or administration of propranolol (a β-adrenergic antagonist) decreased the stimulation-evoked and distension-evoked volume thresholds by − 25 % to − 39 %. Neither hypogastric nerve transection nor propranolol affected contraction magnitude, and robust bladder contractions were still evoked by stimulation at volume thresholds below the distension-evoked volume threshold. As well, inhibition of distention-evoked reflex bladder contractions by 10 Hz stimulation of the DNP was preserved following bilateral hypogastric nerve transection. Administration of phentolamine (an α-adrenergic antagonist) increased stimulation-evoked and distension-evoked volume thresholds by 18 %, but again, robust contractions were still evoked by stimulation at volumes below the distension-evoked threshold. These results indicate that sympathetic mechanisms contribute to establishing the volume dependence of reflex contractions but are not critical to the excitatory pudendal to bladder reflex. A strong correlation between the magnitude of stimulation-evoked bladder contractions and bladder volume supports that convergence of pelvic afferents and pudendal afferents is responsible for bladder excitation evoked by pudendal afferents. Further, abolition of stimulation-evoked bladder contractions following administration of <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> confirmed that contractions were generated by pelvic efferent activation via the pelvic ganglion. These findings indicate that pudendal afferent stimulation evokes bladder contractions through convergence with pelvic afferents to increase pelvic efferent activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} {{sensitivity of}} different vascular beds to i. v. CGRP {{was investigated in}} the albino rabbit by using the microsphere method. Experiments were performed without pre-treatment on both conscious and pentobarbital-anaesthetized animals. In addition, in one series on conscious animals, rabbits were pre-treated with indomethacin {{in order to reduce}} the formation of prostaglandins. In another series, anaesthetized rabbits were subjected to ganglionic blockade with <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> in order to abolish reflexes involving the autonomic nervous system. 120 pmol kg- 1 of CGRP was given to all the animals, the conscious animals receiving the peptide in one infusion lasting 4 min. In the anaesthetized animals, the dose was divided into first a 5 -min infusion of 30 pmol kg- 1 followed some minutes later by a 3 -min infusion of 90 pmol kg- 1. The most pronounced vasodilatory effects were seen in the pancreas, gallbladder, stomach, duodenum, tongue, teeth and the conjunctiva/nictitating membrane. In some series marked effects were also seen in the dura mater, choroid plexus and some parts of the brain. In the anaesthetized animals almost no statistically significant effects on local blood flows were seen following the first, smaller, dose, but following the larger dose more pronounced effects were observed. Pre-treatment with indomethacin did not to any great extent affect the responses, which contradicts the involvement of prostaglandins. The pattern of the responses was unaffected by the ganglionic blockade, but the variability of response was reduced. In conclusion there are great regional variations in the sensitivity to circulating CGRP. The patterns shows a resemblance to that obtained in other species, but there are some marked differences, The tissues most susceptible to the peptide are those easily exposed to noxious stimuli and containing CGRP in the sensory nerve endings, observations in agreement with the proposed role for the peptide in neurogenic defence mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{atmospheric pressure}} photoionization (APPI) mass spectrometry investigation of <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> is reported. This bisquaternary ammonium salt {{is a model}} system for the investigation of multiply charged species and elucidation of ion formation processes. It {{has been used to}} elucidate the physico-chemical phenomenon occurring when photoionization is carried out at atmospheric pressure. First, the in-source fragmentations were studied for aqueous solutions of the salt with the photoionization lamp switched off, i. e. under thermospray conditions. It is shown that, in this mode of operation, fragmentations are minor and may be classified into two classes, namely dequaternization and charge separation, arising from the two precursors, M 2 + and [M+Br]+. Second, the fragmentation patterns have been monitored in dopant-assisted APPI for different dopants (toluene, toluene-d 8 anisole and hexafluorobenzene) at various amounts. At low dopant flow rates, the [M+Br]+ and M 2 + ions are still observed. As the flow rate is increased, these precursor ions lose intensity and are finally suppressed for all three dopants. Comparison of toluene and toluene-d 8 reveals that H atoms may be transferred from the dopant to the molecular ions, very likely mediated by the solvent. The role of the solvent (water) was also investigated by using heavy water. Apart from the thermospray fragmentations, which are also observed in APPI, several fragmentation pathways appear to be specific to the photoionization process. Photoionization efficiencies are measured by determination of the relative photoionization cross sections with respect to toluene. It is found that, when the ionization efficiencies are taken into account, the depletion of the precursors {{as a function of the}} dopant flow rates is the same for all three dopant molecules. This result shows that the precursor ions are depleted by reactions with the photoelectrons released from the dopant. Three additional mechanisms are proposed to account for this effect: electron transfer or H atom transfer from negatively charged water nanodroplets and H atom transfer from the dopant.

40|$|Using {{slices of}} rat {{hypothalamus}} (400 - 500 micron thick), intracellular and extracellular recordings {{were made of}} activity from eight-eight neurones in the supraoptic nucleus (s. o. n.). Electrical stimulation with single stimuli dorsolateral to s. o. n. was excitatory to fifty-nine phasically firing cells (67 % of total, 95 % of phasic cells). In intracellularly recorded cells, such stimulation reliably evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials which often gave rise to action potentials. Trains of stimuli reliably triggered bursts of action potentials which continued after stimulation had ceased. Stimulation more dorsal or more lateral to the critical region or in the optic tract adjacent to the s. o. n. did not evoke responses. Stimulation dorsomedial to the nucleus produced only direct, probably antidromic, activation of s. o. n. neurones. Application of acetylcholine (ACh) by microperifusion in the s. o. n. region mimicked the effect of electrical stimulation by evoking prolonged discharge in eight of eight tested phasically firing s. o. n. neurones. Non-phasic, continuously firing neurones were either inhibited or unaffected by electrical stimulation in the critical region. The discharge pattern of unaffected cells (six cells) was not modified by locally applied ACh, although they were excited by local application of sodium glutamate. The excitatory, synaptically mediated, responses to stimulation in the dorso-lateral region were blocked reversibly by the nicotinic blockers, d-tubocurarine chloride and <b>hexamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (in seven of seven cells tested), but were unaffected by the muscarinic blocker, atropine, even at high concentrations (two of two cells tested). Thus, this activation appears to be mediated by nicotinic receptors. In separate experiments with the position of stimulating and recording electrodes reversed, s. o. n. stimulation was effective in antidromically activating one cell of sixty-eight recorded extracellularly in the dorsolateral region. Some slowly firing s. o. n. neurones (less than 4 Hz) were inhibited by electrical stimulation {{in the same area}} in which phasically active cells were excited. In these cases, stimulation produced large summating i. p. s. p. s. and/or inhibition of ongoing activity {{for the duration of the}} stimulus train. These results support evidence from earlier studies that the cholinergic input to s. o. n. neurones originates from cells in its close proximity, and suggests this input to be via a monosynaptic pathway...|$|E
