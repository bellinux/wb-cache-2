The present study aims to illuminates this debate by measuring, and comparing learners ’ writing, resolving anaphors, and making inference on text using both Sepedi and English among grade 7 readers in three randomly selected schools in rural Limpopo. Two schools speaking the same dialect of Semmamabolo (language closer to standard variety of Sepedi) were selected randomly from Mankweng circuit. One school was conveniently selected from Tzaneen to serve as a pseudo group to measure dialectal influence for reading performance of the learners for both Semmamabolo and Selobdu dialects. The dialectal schools were compared to measure if there were differences in performance and Selobedu School served as a psedo-school, to determine the <b>dialectical</b> <b>difference.</b> The learners were tested on reading comprehension with the use of making inference test and anaphoric resolution test. A one-time series design was used to study and compare the two languages and dialect reading scores within and between subjects. The sample consisted of n= 150 participants for the tests in both English and Sepedi. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) results reveal low reading levels in both the participants ’ home language and English with scores of (-+ 40 %) below 75 % and no differential dialect performances within Sepedi. The results indicate that learners are not about the same level in their reading comprehension skills in both the languages.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the ongoing {{result of an}} approach developed by the collaboration of a computational linguist with a field linguist that addresses one of the oft-overlooked keys to language maintenance: the development of modern language-learning tools. Although machine translation isn’t commonly {{thought of as a}} language learning tool, it can be a useful way for learners to better visualize the word-formation process and explore the structure of their own language, particularly in highly agglutinative languages like Aymara and Quechua. Moreover, the availability of translation software could eventually facilitate greater interlinguistic communication between speakers of minority languages and serve to further legitimize written production by such marginalized speakers. We provide an overview of how this software functions, describing the process by which the morphological analyzer (tagger) provides an input for the syntactic analysis (parser). We also give an overview of further possible applications of this work and show how this approach can be easily tweaked to account for different varieties within a given language, thereby preserving intervariant and <b>dialectical</b> <b>differences</b> along with the richness of variation. Moreover, we show how this model can be replicated for other languages and highlight the possibility of collaborative development with native speakers...|$|R
