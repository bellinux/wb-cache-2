500|$|Dick Enberg {{hosted the}} post-match {{ceremony}} during which a victorious del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request {{saying that he}} was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, del Potro made the same request again, and only then did Enberg relent saying, [...] "Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his <b>friends</b> <b>here</b> and in Argentina." [...] An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.|$|E
