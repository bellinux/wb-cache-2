5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a <b>human</b> <b>embryo.</b> The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

The law prohibited research on <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> created in France but permitted research on <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> brought to France. The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after in vitro fertilization.|$|R
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>embryos</b> {{frequently}} harbor large-scale complex chromosomal {{errors that}} impede normal development. Affected embryos {{may fail to}} implant although many first breach the endometrial epithelium and embed in the decidualizing stroma before being rejected via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that developmentally impaired <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> elicit an endoplasmic stress response in human decidual cells. A stress response was also evident upon in vivo exposure of mouse uteri to culture medium conditioned by low-quality <b>human</b> <b>embryos.</b> By contrast, signals emanating from developmentally competent embryos activated a focused gene network enriched in metabolic enzymes and implantation factors. We further show that trypsin, a serine protease released by pre-implantation embryos, elicits Ca 2 + signaling in endometrial epithelial cells. Competent <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> triggered short-lived oscillatory Ca 2 + fluxes whereas low-quality embryos caused a heightened and prolonged Ca 2 + response. Thus, distinct positive and negative mechanisms contribute to active selection of <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> at implantation...|$|R

Studying signal transduction along with genetic manipulation within the early <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> has the potential to provide answers to many developmental diseases and defects. Many human-specific signaling pathways have been discovered by studying human embryonic stem cells. Studying developmental pathways in humans has given developmental biologists more evidence toward the hypothesis that developmental pathways are conserved throughout species.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> {{has three}} germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During {{the second week}} of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to necrosis, {{which is a}} form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{stem cell}} {{controversy}} is {{the consideration of}} the ethics of research involving the development, use, and destruction of <b>human</b> <b>embryos.</b> Most commonly, this controversy focuses on embryonic stem cells. Not all stem cell research involves the <b>human</b> <b>embryos.</b> For example, adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} do not involve creating, using, or destroying <b>human</b> <b>embryos,</b> and thus are minimally, if at all, controversial. Many less controversial sources of acquiring stem cells include using cells from the umbilical cord, breast milk, and bone marrow, which are not pluripotent.|$|R

25|$|Of all cleavage-stages, it is {{generally}} agreed that the optimal moment for biopsy is at the eight-cell stage. It is diagnostically safer than the PB biopsy and, unlike blastocyst biopsy, it allows for the diagnosis of the embryos before day 5. In this stage, the cells are still totipotent and the embryos are not yet compacting. Although {{it has been shown}} that up to a quarter of a <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> can be removed without disrupting its development, it still remains to be studied whether the biopsy of one or two cells correlates with the ability of the embryo to further develop, implant and grow into a full term pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have {{developed}} a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born {{at a very early}} stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. When the joey is born, it {{is about the size of}} a lima bean. The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180–320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.|$|E
25|$|A Child Is Born (full title: A Child Is Born: The {{drama of}} life before birth in {{unprecedented}} photographs. A practical {{guide for the}} expectant mother; original Swedish title: Ett barn blir till) is a 1965 photographic book by Swedish photojournalist Lennart Nilsson. The book consists of photographs charting {{the development of the}} <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> and fetus from conception to birth; it is reportedly the best-selling illustrated book ever published. Nilsson's photographs are accompanied by text, written by doctors, describing prenatal development and offering advice on antenatal care. The images were among the first of developing fetuses to reach a wide popular audience. Their reproduction in the April 30, 1965, edition of Life magazine sparked so much interest that the entire print run, of eight million copies, sold out within four days; they won Nilsson the American National Press Association Picture of the Year award, and reached a sufficiently iconic status to be chosen for launch into space aboard the NASA probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.
