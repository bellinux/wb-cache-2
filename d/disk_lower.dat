2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the <b>disk.</b> <b>Lower</b> recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

We include a point mass embedded within the disk {{and follow the}} migration of that point mass through the disk. Companions with masses M_c 0. 5 M_J can open {{a gap in the}} disk sufficient to halt rapid migration through the <b>disk.</b> <b>Lower</b> mass companions open gaps, but migration continues because sufficient disk mass remains close to the disk to exert large tidal torques. We find that the torques which dominate the migration of low mass planets originate within a radial region within 1 - 2 Hill radii of the planet's orbit radius, a distance smaller than the thickness of the disk. We conclude that a very high resolution 3 D treatment will be required to adequately describe the planet's migration.

40|$|Many {{galaxies are}} {{expected}} to harbor binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Their interaction with the surrounding gas results in accretion and exchange of angular momentum via tidal torques, facilitating binary inspiral. Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two processes and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied circumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our results {{in terms of the}} angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we come up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk structures, which differ from the standard constant Ṁ accretion disk solution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a significant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral. We show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously transmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can merge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the inspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even if the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass <b>disk</b> (<b>lower</b> than its own mass). This is important for resolving the "last parsec" problem for SMBH binaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe. We argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent simulations cannot persist {{for a long time and}} should not affect the long-term orbital inspiral. We also review the existing simulations of the SMBH binary-disk coupling and propose a numerical setup, which is particularly well suited for verifying our theoretical predictions.

5000|$|The grand tack {{scenario}} {{ignores the}} ongoing accretion of gas on both Jupiter and Saturn. [...] In fact, to drive outward migration {{and move the}} planets to the proximity of their current orbits, the solar nebula had to contain a sufficiently large reservoir of gas around the orbits of the two planets. However, this gas would provide a source for accretion, which would affect the growth of Jupiter and Saturn and their mass ratio. [...] The type of nebula density required for capture in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance is especially dangerous {{for the survival of}} the two planets, because it can lead to significant mass growth and ensuing planet-planet scattering. But conditions leading to 2:1 mean-motion resonant systems may also put the planets at danger. Accretion of gas on both planet also tends to reduce the supply toward the inner <b>disk,</b> <b>lowering</b> the accretion rate toward the Sun. This process works to deplete somewhat the disk interior to Jupiter's orbit, weakening the torques on Jupiter arising from inner Lindblad resonances and potentially ending the planets' outward migration.|$|R
2500|$|Special {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on reducing the weight of the V-280 in comparison to the V-22, which in turn would reduce cost.

40|$|Recent {{simulations}} on super-Eddington accretion flows {{have shown}} that, {{apart from the}} diffusion process, the vertical advection based on magnetic buoyancy can be a more efficient process to release the trapped photons in the optically thick disk. As a consequence, the radiative luminosity from the accretion disk can be far beyond the Eddington value. Following this spirit, we revisit the structure and radiation of hyper-accretion disks with mass accretion rates in the range 10 ^- 3 ∼ 10 M_ s^- 1. Our results show that, due to the strong cooling through the vertical advection, the <b>disk</b> temperature becomes <b>lower</b> than that in the classic model without the vertical advection process, and therefore the neutrino luminosity from the <b>disk</b> is <b>lower.</b> On the other hand, the gamma-ray photons released through the vertical advection can be extremely super-Eddington.

40|$|Abstract — RAID {{has long}} been {{established}} as {{an effective way to}} provide highly reliable as well as high-performance disk subsystems. However, reliability in RAID systems comes at the cost of extra disks. In this paper, we describe a mechanism that we have termed RAID 0. 5 that enables striped disks with very high data reliability but low disk cost. We take advantage of the fact that most disk systems use backup systems for disaster recovery. With the use of these backup systems, the disk system needs to only replicate data since the last backup, thus drastically reducing the storage space requirement. Though RAID 0. 5 has the same data loss characteristics of traditional mirroring, the lower storage space comes at the cost of lower availability. Thus, RAID 0. 5 is a tradeoff between <b>lower</b> <b>disk</b> cost and <b>lower</b> availability while still preserving very high data reliability. We present analytical reliability models and experimental results that demonstrate the enhanced reliability and performance of the proposed RAID 0. 5 system. I...|$|R

40|$|Fragmentation of protostellar disks {{controls}} {{the growth of}} protostars and {{plays a key role}} in determining the final mass of newborn stars. In this paper, we investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar disks in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the mass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding collapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their evolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher metallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and lower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~ 1 e- 3 Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~ 1 e- 6 Msun/yr and 10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero- and solar-metallicity disks have similar stability properties: the Toomre parameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio of temperatures in the disk and in the envelope as Q ~ (T_disk/T_env) ^ 3 / 2, is > 1, i. e., marginally stable. At intermediate metallicities of 1 e- 5 [...] 1 e- 3 Zsun, however, the disks are found to be strongly unstable with Q ~ 0. 1 [...] 1 since dust cooling, which is effective only in the disks due to their high density (> 1 e 10 cm^- 3), makes the temperature in the <b>disks</b> <b>lower</b> than that in the envelopes. This indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the protostellar disk fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent core in this metallicity range. The typical stellar mass in this case would be a few Msun, which is consistent with the observationally suggested mass-scale of extremely metal-poor stars.
