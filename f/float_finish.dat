50|$|Manning’s n, denoted as n, quantifies a channel’s {{roughness}}. In any flow scenario, channel roughness {{can play}} {{a large role in}} the rate at which water conveys through the channel. A higher value of Manning’s n indicates that a channel is rough and thereby creates more friction as the water moves through the channel. This friction causes a loss in energy and consequentially a reduction in flow velocity. A smaller n value has the opposite effect. The Manning’s n value for common materials, such wood or cement can be found in literature. The observed channel material is Portland cement concrete. For the purpose of this exploration a Manning’s n of 0.013, the value associated with <b>float</b> <b>finish</b> concrete, was used.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{traditional}} lime plaster in restoration of old buildings {{is motivated by}} both technical and historic reasons. The plasterer deals daily with a multivariable problem where the variables are related in such a complex way {{that we are not}} even close to finding converging solutions by traditional scientific methods. The decisions and actions of the craftsman will have an influence on both the surface structure and the inner structure of the lime plaster. The present paper will focus on the time between application of mortar and working on the surface to make a <b>floated</b> <b>finish.</b> In total, 32 lime plaster surfaces have been analysed. Half of them have been worked on after they have stiffened up and half of them have been worked on while they are still fresh. The results clearly show that the time between application of mortar and working the surface is a critical parameter. If you wait until the right time, you receive a more homogeneous and compact material with an open surface and a higher frost resistance.

30|$|Network {{techniques}} {{are often used}} in technological processes of optimisation that contain many interrelated activities. One approach that has been widely used is the critical path method, in which a network diagram depicts activities ranked in order of precedence. This method also calculates their starting, <b>float,</b> and <b>finishing</b> times to identify critical activities, and it constructs a time chart to display possible project schedules. Critical path method (CPM) {{was developed by the}} DuPont Company in 1957 Pašagić [16].|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{ambition}} of King Gustav III (1746-1792) {{to construct a}} road from {{the city to the}} palace at Drottningholm Palace, the first bridge at this location was a <b>floating</b> bridge <b>finished</b> in 1787, defrayed by the funds granted the king as christening gift while named crown prince in 1779. As neglected maintenance made it necessary to rebuild the bridge by the 1850s, the new floating bridge was then relocated slightly southwards, thus reaching into the valley on the western shore.|$|R
50|$|<b>Float</b> trowel or <b>finishing</b> trowel {{is usually}} rectangular, used to smooth, level, or texture {{the top layer}} of {{hardening}} concrete. A flooring trowel has one rectangular end and one pointed end, made to fit corners. A grout float is used for applying and working grout into gaps in floor and wall tile.|$|R
50|$|Rubber duck races, {{also known}} as derby duck races, {{have been used as}} a method of {{fundraising}} for organizations worldwide. People donate money to the organization by sponsoring a duck. At the end of the fundraising drive, all of the ducks are dumped into a waterway, with the first to <b>float</b> past the <b>finish</b> line winning a prize for its sponsor.|$|R
50|$|While most tools have {{remained}} unchanged over the centuries, developments in modern materials {{have led to}} some changes. Trowels, originally constructed from steel, are now available in a polycarbonate material that allows the application of certain new, acrylic-based materials without staining the <b>finish.</b> <b>Floats,</b> traditionally made of timber (ideally straight-grained, knot-free, yellow pine), are often finished {{with a layer of}} sponge or expanded polystyrene.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were prepared}} {{with a number}} of modifications from standard specification. Hulls and wingtip <b>floats</b> were <b>finished</b> with white enamel and larger engine radiators, oil tanks and top-plane fuel tanks were fitted. In addition, there were internal changes to provide more space and support facilities for the crew, who had to live on board for periods during the trip. Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. [...] Specially designed collapsible rubber dinghies were also carried. No automatic pilots or blind flying aids were fitted, and only two of the four aircraft had radio sets - communication between aircraft in the air being by lamp or hand-signals.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally {{has been}} used the word artisan to {{describe}} first, the creators of the floats, ignoring their families and partners involved {{in the preparation of}} the figures of Great Parade. However, various sectors support this word must be replaced by [...] "Cultores" [...] or [...] "Carnival Artists", not only for being more inclusive, but also due to the professional and artistic value of work performed into <b>finishing</b> <b>floats.</b>|$|R

The tree is growing out of the pitcher, trying to break it. Morin sought to emphasize the increasing world of separation between man and nature, as [...] "creatures that grow in containers." ...|$|R
25|$|This {{festival is}} held {{annually}} and features colorful lantern floats called nebuta which are pulled {{through the streets}} of Central Aomori. This festival is held from about August 2–7 every year. This event attracts millions of visitors. During this festival, 20 large nebuta floats are paraded through the streets near Aomori JR rail station. These floats are constructed of wooden bases and metal frames. Japanese papers, called washi, are painted onto the frames. These amazing <b>floats</b> are <b>finished</b> off with the historical figures or kabuki being painted on the paper. These floats can take up to a year to complete. There is a dance portion of this festival. There are haneto dancers and they wear special costumes for this dance. Everyone is welcome to purchase their own haneto costume that they may too join in on the fun (Mishima, Aomori Nebuta Festival).|$|R
50|$|The Pear Spinning Company, Lower Bredbury, was {{registered}} in 1907, {{with the intention}} of erecting a large double mill. It was one of the Stockport Limiteds mills, modelled on the Oldham Limiteds. It had a share capital of ₤100,000 in ₤5 shares. Work commenced in 1908, but the boom for cotton ended and it was difficult to raise capital. With ₤55,000 spent, the shell of the mill had been completed when the company was put into liquidation in January 1912. In April a new company was <b>floated</b> to <b>finish</b> the mill. This was the Pear New Mill Limited - it had a capital of ₤90,000 in ₤3 shares. Production started in July 1913 and the mill was fully equipped for spinning medium and fine counts by November. Immediately production was interrupted by the 1914-1918 war. The two years between 1918 and 1920 were years of an exceptional boom, and the 1912 company was refloated with a capital of ₤250,000. This was the Pear New Mill (1919) Ltd company. The war had taken its toll on the Lancashire cotton industry and former markets such as India, China and Japan had built up their own spinning capacity. The price of cotton pieces fell to 38% of their 1913 value - and though Pear New Mill did survive - it lost its independence and became part of Combined Egyptian Mills Ltd.|$|R
60|$|Upon stating this much, {{he stepped}} into his boat, {{requesting}} all who were so disposed to follow him. The sailors, from their habits, found no scruple on this subject, {{and all of the}} artificers, though a little tardy, also embarked, excepting four of the masons, who, from the beginning, mentioned that they would decline working on Sundays. It may here be noticed that throughout the whole of the operations it was observable that the men wrought, if possible, with more keenness upon the Sundays than at other times from an impression that they were engaged in a work of imperious necessity, which required every possible exertion. On returning to the <b>floating</b> light, after <b>finishing</b> the tide’s work, the boats were received by the part of the ship’s crew left on board with the usual attention of handing ropes to the boats and helping the artificers on board; but the four masons who had absented themselves from the work did not appear upon deck.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to a week-long plaster application, an entire house can be drywalled {{in one or two}} days by two experienced drywallers, and drywall is easy enough to use that it can be installed by many amateur home carpenters. In large-scale commercial construction, the work of installing and finishing drywall is often split between the drywall mechanics, or hangers, who install the wallboard, and the tapers and mudmen, or <b>float</b> crew, who <b>finish</b> the joints and cover the fastener heads with drywall compound. Dry wall can be finished anywhere from a level 0 to a level 5, where 0 is not finished in any fashion and 5 is the most [...] "pristine". Depending on how significant the finish is to the customer the extra steps in the finish {{may or may not be}} necessary, though priming and painting of drywall is recommended in any location where it may be exposed to any wear.|$|R
50|$|Floats come in {{different}} sizes and shapes, {{and can be}} made from various materials, such as balsa wood, cork, plastic, Indian sarcanda reed (Erianthus family), or even bird/porcupine quills. The float is used to enable the angler to cast out a bait away from the shore or boat while maintaining a reference point to where the bait is unlike bottom or leger fishing. The angler will select an appropriate float after taking into account the strength of the current (if any), the wind speed, the size of the bait he or she is using, the depth the angler wishes to present that bait at and the distance the bait is to be cast. Usually, the line between the float and hook will have small weights attached, ensuring that the float sits vertically in the water with only a small brightly coloured tip remaining visible. The rest of the <b>float</b> is usually <b>finished</b> in a dull neutral colour to render it as inconspicuous as possible to the fish. Each float style is designed to be used in certain types of conditions such as slow or fast rivers, windy or still water or small confined waters such as canals.|$|R
5000|$|Second Event: In Remedios {{city the}} second event is the {{lighting}} of the Plaza works, {{in the rest}} of the cities is the Float lighting. Floats are huge architectural structures filled with colors, light bulbs and fantasy décor hauled by a tractor. They have a theme each year and the characters on them have over the top fantasized outfits. In most of the towns these characters should keep still like statues, they are not allowed to move while the float is moving forward and the legend is read to the public, failing to do so will demerit the district. In Taguayabon on the contrary while the legend is read the characters perform as in a theater play. But this behavior is rather new and been consider “un-tasty” and against the tradition in the nearby locations. Final event: The fireworks. When the <b>float’s</b> legend is <b>finished</b> and the structure has reached the end of its travel, which is no more than 40 meters, the pyrotechnics, which have rapidly placed lines as long as three or four blocks of rockets in the streets, use torches and running by the sides of the racks lit them. Once single run should use near 20 000 rockets. When the regular fireworks are finished the “mortars” are lit as well. Mortars are the antithesis of Palenques since this type of firework makes a really loud [...] "canon like" [...] sound that announces the end of its district display.|$|R
