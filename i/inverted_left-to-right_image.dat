5000|$|Grand Prix - This mode has one or {{two players}} {{participate}} in four consecutive three-lap races, each on a different course, {{on one of the}} four selectable cups (Mushroom, Flower, Star, or Special) against seven (or six) computer players. When the player completes a race, points are awarded based on the rank he or she finished. If the player ranks 5th or under, the player will be required to repeat the race. After finishing all four races, trophies are awarded to the players who scored the highest accumulation of points: bronze for third place, silver for second, and gold for first. Difficulty level is measured by engine size: 50, 100, or 150cc. There is an additional unlockable difficulty called 'Extra', which allows players to race at speed 100cc on tracks that are <b>inverted</b> <b>left-to-right.</b> This is the first game in the series to provide this feature. Later installments call this feature [...] "Mirror Mode" [...] or [...] "150cc Mirror Mode." ...|$|R

30|$|Sparse feature-{{matching}} and image-to-image matching procedures (Forsyth and Ponce 2003; Brown and Lowe 2007) {{are used}} to estimate the camera motion incrementally. We pose the problem as a template-matching problem that tries to find {{the location of the}} overlapping area of the images inside the other image. This way we perform left-to-right and frame-to-frame matching. Robot motion estimate gives us the rough location of overlapping area for consecutive frames. Rough overlapping area for <b>left-to-right</b> <b>images</b> matching is fixed since the camera locations on the platform are fixed. Knowing the overlapping area, appearance-based template matching can give finer estimation of the camera motion. If the robot motion estimation is not accessible or not accurate enough, overlapping area can be searched over the whole image, which is a more time consuming process.|$|R
40|$|ISBN: 0 - 8186 - 7898 - 4 International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{two-dimensional}} stochastic method for the recognition of unconstrained handwritten words in a small lexicon. The method {{is based on an}} efficient combination of hidden Markov models (hmms) and causal Markov random fields (mrfs). It operates in a holistic manner, at the pixel level, on scaled binary word images which are assumed to be random field realizations. The state-related random fields act as smooth local estimators of specific writing strokes by merging conditional pixel probabilities along the columns of the image. The hmm component of our model provides an optimal switching mechanism between sets of mrf distributions in order to dynamically adapt to the features encountered during the <b>left-to-right</b> <b>image</b> scan. Experiments performed on a French omni-scriptor, omni-bank database of handwritten legal check amounts provided by the A 2 iA company are described in great extent...|$|R

Flipper control remains {{intuitive}} in Mirror Mode, with the left trigger controlling the left on-screen flipper. Side-specific features of some games, such as Lane Change, move to {{the opposite side of the}} machine.|$|R

25|$|This {{aliasing}} {{is visible}} in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from <b>left-to-right,</b> the 2D <b>image</b> does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, {{the speed of the}} viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.|$|R

The distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) is in the left upper quadrant of the image. Its main branches (also visible) are the left circumflex artery (LCX), which courses top-to-bottom initially and then toward the centre/bottom, and the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which courses from <b>left-to-right</b> on the <b>image</b> and then courses {{down the middle of}} the image to project underneath of the distal LCX. The LAD, as is usual, has two large diagonal branches, which arise at the centre-top of the image and course toward the centre/right of the image.|$|R

Top-ranked {{images for}} the query ‘eiffel tower’, using (a) a text-based image search engine and (b) our model, ordered <b>left-to-right.</b> Web <b>image</b> search using text queries has {{received}} considerable attention. However, current state-of-the-art approaches require training models for every new query, {{and are therefore}} unsuitable for real-world web search applications. The key contribution {{of this paper is}} to introduce generic classifiers that are based on query-relative features which can be used for new queries without additional training. They combine textual features, based on the occurence of query terms in web pages and image meta-data, and visual histogram representations of images. The second contribution of the paper is a new database for the evaluation of web image search algorithms. It includes 71478 images returned by a web search engine for 353 different search queries, along with their meta-data and ground-truth annotations. Using this data set, we compared the image ranking performance of our model with that of the search engine, and with an approach that learns a separate classifier for each query. Our generic models that use query-relative features improve significantly over the raw search engine ranking, and also outperform the query-specific models. 1...|$|R

(<b>Left-to-right)</b> Original <b>image</b> with user scribbles to indicate an object template (red) and background (green); repeated instances detected, completed, dense correspondence established, and ordered in layers; {{fish in the}} original image replaced by {{a different kind of}} fish from a reference image (top-right inset); rearranged fishes. Repeated elements are ubiquitous and abundant in both manmade and natural scenes. Editing such images while preserving the repetitions and their relations is nontrivial due to overlap, missing parts, deformation across instances, illumination variation, etc. Manually enforcing such relations is laborious and error-prone. We propose a novel framework where user scribbles are used to guide {{detection and}} extraction of such repeated elements. Our detection process, which is based on a novel boundary band method, robustly extracts the repetitions along with their deformations. The algorithm only considers the shape of the elements, and ignores similarity based on color, texture, etc. We then use topological sorting to establish a partial depth ordering of overlapping repeated instances. Missing parts on occluded instances are completed using information from other instances. The extracted repeated instances can then be seamlessly edited and manipulated for a variety of high level tasks that are otherwise difficult to perform. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on a large set of inputs of varying complexity, showing applications to image rearrangement, edit transfer, deformation propagation, and instance replacement. image editing, shape-aware manipulation, edit propa-Keywords: gatio...|$|R
