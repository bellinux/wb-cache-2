50|$|According to environmentalists, the 20-kilometer {{valley of}} the Beirut River, {{especially}} the upper valley, {{is one of the}} most important areas for bird migration in Lebanon, including birds of 33 different species, such as the <b>European</b> <b>Honey-buzzard,</b> Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes, Common Buzzard Buteo buteo, White Stork, White Pelican, European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus, European Bee-eater Merops a piaster, Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica and the Lesser Spotted Eagle.|$|E
40|$|Counts of {{migrating}} raptors at Batumi, Georgia, {{revealed the}} eastern Black Sea coast to form {{one of the}} most important bottlenecks for raptor migration during autumn in the Eurasian-African migration system. Totals for 10 species (<b>European</b> <b>Honey-buzzard</b> Pernis apivorus, Steppe Buzzard Buteo buteo vulpinus, Black Kite Milvus migrans, Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes, Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus, Pallid Harrier Circus macrourus, Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Booted Eagle Aquila pennata) exceeded 1 % of their estimated world population. We compare the observed abundance of each species to estimates of the presumed source populations in European Russia. Counts of most species involved only a limited subset of these source populations, except for <b>European</b> <b>Honey-buzzard</b> and Lesser Spotted Eagle, which were more numerous than predicted. This could be due to inaccurate population estimates or because birds from NE Europe or W Asia are also using this migration route...|$|E
