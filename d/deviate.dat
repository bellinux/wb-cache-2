5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road <b>deviate</b> to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Septoplasty for {{correction}} of <b>deviated</b> nose often requires {{removal of the}} <b>deviated</b> part of the quadrangular cartilage and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone or vomer. In most cases, the removed bone is discarded. We de-scribe our experience using septal bone for <b>deviated</b> nose correction, and analyze the postoperative results. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients who underwent {{correction of}} <b>deviated</b> nose using nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage from January 2004 to August 2008. The subjective satisfaction of pa-tients was evaluated 6 to 12 months after rhinoplasty with a questionnaire. Aesthetic outcomes were evaluated by 2 inde-pendent rhinoplastic surgeons who compared preoperative and postoperative photographs. To evaluate outcomes objec-tively, we made anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose before and after surgery using facial photographs. Results: All patients indicated cosmetic satisfaction and improvement in nasal obstruction. The outcome analysis by 2 independent rhinoplastic surgeons indicated that 13 patients had excellent, 5 patients had good, and 5 had fair outcomes. Anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose showed that both the curved <b>deviated</b> angles and the linear <b>deviated</b> angle had improved (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Use of nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage appears to be feasible in corrective rhino-plasty, and may be particularly beneficial in cartilage-depleted patients...|$|R

This study designed a 2 -equation simultaneous system with a specified covariance matrix and examined the correlation between the pairs of normal <b>deviates</b> generated and the implied covariance matrix. The result showed that the random disturbances generated from normal <b>deviates</b> with feeble correlation coefficient (negative or positive) reproduced the specified variance-covariance matrix while others failed.

The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to <b>deviate</b> from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E

40|$|The {{two general}} data {{analytic}} questions of subgroup mining (B 2. 2) deal with deviations and associations (C 5. 2. 3, C 5. 2. 4).

Deviation patterns rely on statistical tests and thus capture knowledge about a subgroup in form of a verified alternative hypothesis on the distribution of a target variable. Typically the rejected null hypothesis assumes an uninteresting, not <b>deviating</b> subgroup. Search for <b>deviating</b> subgroups is organized in two phases.

5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to <b>deviate</b> from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor.

When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

Methods: We performed rhinoplasty in six patients by inserting a spreader graft in the convex side of the <b>deviated</b> nose and followed them for two years. Results: All six patients presented an improvement in the external appearance of their noses.
