To achieve this goal, the collected data were analyzed and compared with their Persian equivalents. Then, the theories of Newmark (1988 & 2001), Larson (1998), and Nolan (2005) were used in order to find the applied strategies for rendering the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by the translators.

The language encompasses a series <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> This study was performed as an alternative practice in teaching English poetry. <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> intrinsically compose English poetry. Because the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> contain implied meaning, {{they might not be}} easily meaningful to a reader of the lyric. This study is intended to describe the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> so that the language becomes more understandable to the reader. This study applies a textual analysis, and it adopts Leech’s linguistic guide to English poetry. The linguistic guide includes absurdity in the language of poetry; transference of meaning; and over and counter statement. The discussion works on each of the lyric’s lines, and it results in the series <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> comprising oxymoron, paradox, synecdoche, metaphor, metonymy, hyperbole, litotes, and irony. The <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> indicate that the language is arranged to sweetly sound a melody. Besides that, the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> indicate that the language is also used figuratively to contain the meaning. In other words, in the lyric, the language was used not only to be sung melodically, but it was also used to be written poetically. ...|$|R

Thus, it must have a certain style to differentiate one advertisement from the others. In this study, the writer wants to analyze the types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and the language functions that are used in the advertisements found in male and female magazines especially in Gentlemen's Quarterly and Marie Claire. The writer was also curious to know the different <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and language functions found in those magazines. She assumed that each advertisement had different <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and different language functions. The writer used Lawrence Perrine's Theory (1969, pp. 65 - 66) to explain the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and also the theory of Language Function by Kennedy (2003, p. 309). The data were divided based on the advertisements found in Marie Claire and gentlemen's Quarterly magazines.

Finally the writer described the <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and the language functions for each sentence. The method used in this study is descriptive qualitative. In this research, the writer found out that the types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> that occurred in both advertisements were hyperbole and metonymy and the language functions that occurred in both advertisements were informatives, directives and emotives.

It is aimed at identifying the types and functions <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by comparison in the novel. This research applied descriptive qualitative method. However, to support the interpretation, the researcher also applied quantitative approach in processing the data. The forms of the data were the dialogues of all characters and expressions of the narration in Neil Gaiman’s Coraline which contains <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by comparison. In this research, textual analysis {{was used in the}} analysis of data. Triangulation was used to establish the reliability of data, and to ensure the findings so that it can enhance trustworthiness. The researcher found that there are four types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by comparison proposed by Perrine which are applied by Neil Gaiman in Coraline novel. Those types are simile (79 data), personification (46 data), metaphor (15 data), and apostrophe (1 datum). The author only applies one apostrophe because of its complexity. The most frequently used type <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by comparison is simile. The writer used simile often to give a better picture of a certain situation or characteristic of a certain character. Bringing additional imagery and giving imaginative pleasure are the main functions of the use <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by comparison in Coraline novel because <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> often make concrete understanding and pleasure in readers’ mind.

500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E

While in office, Cristina Kirchner avoided referring to him by name, and talked instead about [...] "He" [...] or [...] "Him", with emphasis on the pronoun and with a universally capitalized form. As in the English language, in the Spanish language this <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> is usually reserved to make reference to God. Kirchner was also compared with San Martín, {{in an attempt to}} raise him to a similar status as a national hero. This comparison was included, for instance, in an official video by the ministry of social welfare. A month after his death many districts renamed streets, schools, neighbourhoods, institutions and other places after [...] "Néstor Kirchner". Some noteworthy examples are the Néstor Kirchner Cultural Centre (formerly [...] "Bicentennial Cultural Centre") and the second leg of the 2010–11 Argentine Primera División season. The change proved controversial in some cities, such as Caleta Olivia, where the renamed street was formerly named after the Falklands War veterans. A bill to rename a street after Kirchner was rejected in Apóstoles, Misiones. No renaming bill was even considered in Buenos Aires, as a previous law only allowed streets to be named after people who had died at least a decade before. The presidency of Mauricio Macri proposed a bill in 2016 to forbid any public places or institutions from being named after people unless they had died at least two decades before; if approved, all the state properties named after Kirchner would have to be renamed.|$|E

The book Exit from Communism edited by Stephen Richards Graubard made a similar point, that the term encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: [...] "Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do or perhaps they do not lynch blacks... Ultimately it does not matter whether we are for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story." [...] With the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, The New York Times reported that the tactic could see decreased usage: [...] "In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violation with 'But you hang Negroes,' analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain." [...] Journalist George Feifer recounted in a 2009 article how when he traveled to Moscow in 1959 to cover the American National Exhibition, he faced those using the phrase against him. Feifer wrote: [...] "Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?"

In stylistic approach, style can be seen in figurative language through <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> Thus, the aims of this research are to describe the types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and to find out the functions <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in Les Miserables. This research employed descriptive qualitative approach. The data were in the form of utterances (words, phrases, clauses, and utterances) spoken by the characters in Les Miserables movie. The main instrument of the study was the researcher herself. The researcher employed some steps during the data collection: watching the movie, finding its script, making data sheet, and categorizing the data. In conducting the data analysis, the researcher passed some steps, identifying, classifying, and making interpretation. To gain the data trustworthiness, the researcher asked triangulators to check the data. Using Perrine’s classification <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> this results show that there are eleven types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in Les Miserables Movie. They are simile (12 times), metaphor (20 times), personification (22 times), apostrophe (10 times), metonymy (once), synecdoche (7 times), symbol (22 times), paradox (8 times), hyperbole (13 times), irony (16 times), and litotes (10 times). The most often used types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> are personification and symbol. The character used personification often to depict a story as if this world can execute anything. Meanwhile, the use of symbol was used to represent idea in society. The functions <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> found in the movie are to give imaginative pleasure (105 times), to give additional imagery (86 times), to add emotional intensity (77 times), and to concrete the meaning in a brief compass (60 times). Giving imaginative pleasure is the main function of the use <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in Les Miserables movie because most figurative language can create pleasure in readers’ mind...|$|R
