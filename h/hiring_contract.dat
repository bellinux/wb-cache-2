40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} factors affecting a firm?s decision to <b>hire</b> <b>contract</b> workers. We use information from a specially commissioned survey of manufacturing firms undertaken in 2014 by ICRIER, {{as part of a}} World Bank funded project ?Jobs and Development: Creating Multi-Disciplinary Solutions?. The survey covered 500 firms in five states, namely Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat and spread across five major industries; viz. Auto Components, Electronics and Electrical Equipment, Leather Products, Textile and Garments and Food Processing. The estimation is carried out using a logit model, where the firm?s decision, whether or not to <b>hire</b> a <b>contract</b> worker is assumed to be a binary dependent variable. Our findings suggest that the firms producing for the export market are more likely to engage contract workers than the ones producing for domestic market. Secondly, presence of trade union activity considerably increases the likelihood for a firm to hire-in contract worker. Further, we find that {{there seems to be a}} higher probability for enterprises belonging to a capital-intensive industry to <b>hire</b> in <b>contract</b> workers than the ones belonging to a labour-intensive industry. Next, our findings also suggest that the firms located in states having a ?protective? labour legislation are more likely to <b>hire</b> <b>contract</b> workers than the ones located in states with rather flexible labour regulations. The most interesting finding, however, pertains to the ?skills? variable.

50|$|On 1 July 1977, 96% of Aeroamerica's unionised German {{flight attendants}} voted {{in favour of}} strike action in a ballot held by the German Salaried Employees' Union. They demanded pay parity with their colleagues working for Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) {{division}} and employment contracts governed by local labour law to bring them in line with their unionised counterparts at other Allied airlines that employed their flight attendants locally. The company countered these demands by arguing {{that the nature of}} its business required flight attendants to be stationed anywhere, involving frequent postings to overseas stations at short notice to cover global ad hoc and lease commitments. It furthermore argued that adopting other Allied airlines' local employment conditions and pay for its own flight attendants would restrict operational flexibility and increase costs, that this would undermine its ability to compete globally and that the worldwide nature of its operations made all flight attendants' employment conditions subject to American labour law as well as CAB and FAA regulations to comply with US legal requirements. Initially, the airline was able to maintain its full flying programme {{at the beginning of the}} busy summer holiday period despite staff not showing up for work, following the first week of unsuccessful negotiations between Aeroamerica's local management and the DAG union. However, the conflict escalated during the second week when the local management dismissed without notice two flight attendants who had picketed a Tegel-bound flight in Brussels. As the conflict was still unresolved by the end of July and threatened to disrupt the holiday plans of thousands of West Berliners during the peak month of August, management attempted to break the flight attendants' strike by temporarily reducing the number of flight attendants from four to three per aircraft as well as by <b>hiring</b> <b>contract</b> labour from an unnamed UK airline. As these developments further aggravated the already tense standoff between the airline and its flight attendants' union, the latter sought to increase pressure on the company to settle the dispute by airing its members' grievancies in public. It alleged that Aeroamerica's policy of only complying with minimum FAA requirements resulted in overworking flight attendants, putting lives of crew and passengers at risk in case of an emergency. Despite the negative publicity, management refused to return to the negotiating table and the strike eventually collapsed as the peak summer season drew to a close by the end of August. Following the end of the labour unrest at the company, the FAA subjected Aeroamerica to an unannounced safety audit later the same year. The airline's management alleged that the FAA's move had been prompted by a dismissed flight attendant's act of revenge.|$|E

However, the cross-section of work-life balance and gender disparity problems found in academia and technology can be particularly troublesome, especially for mothers and single parents. Attracting and retaining diverse talent in work environments that are highly structured or with high expectations of unstated off-the-clock work may be impossible long term. (Indeed, {{it is not only}} parents that experience these work-life balance problems but anyone with caregiver responsibilities such as elder or disabled care.) Those who have the energy and time to devote to technical projects for work and fun in their off-work hours tend to get ahead.

Such problems mirror the experiences of women on the tenure track in academia, particularly women working in libraries, and they provide a useful corollary for this discussion. We present some practical solutions for those in technical positions in libraries. Such solutions involve strategic use of technical tools, and lightweight project management applications. Technical workarounds are not the only answer; real and lasting change will involve a change in individual priorities and departmental culture such as sophisticated and ruthless time management, reviewing workloads, cross-training personnel, <b>hiring</b> <b>contract</b> replacements, and creative divisions of labor.

40|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is {{dedicated}} to study the relations of recruiting among the employee and the employer in a frame characterized by the insecurity conditions of job and large scale of unemployment. The recruiting relationship that we will study is atypical {{as far as the}} offered salary is not a fixed minimum wage. The <b>hiring</b> <b>contract</b> between the employer and the employee in the developing labour markets is made with different conditions regarding to others, mainly in the developed countries. In these countries, the hiring signature of contract is linked to some preconditions like as the regularization statutory of hiring, the minimum of job security, wage and working rights in the case of unfair dismissal. In these conditions and under high level of costs which are engaged by the employer in order to research the skilled work even to pay the various payroll charges, the Principal has been faced with asymmetric information problem concerning the adverse selection linked to the nature of Agent type (informative characteristic of the employee) : is it the check or the bad Agent type? In order to reduce this informative asymmetry, the Principal offers the various recruiting contracts with various pecuniary motivations. The mechanism of game can be a direct mechanism designer where the optimal strategy of the Agent is to announce its true type (it’s a situation where is benefit for the Agent to make sincere announcements) in order to maximize his expected utility. This standard modelling of Principal/Agent theory is not adapted with the labour markets situation in the case of poor and less developed countries. In the case of labour markets where the hiring conditions are much unsecured, we note that the Incentive Compatibility and the Individual Rationality of Agent do not exist. In fact, we are facing a problem {{in which there is a}} sort of indecision of reserved salary which allows the Agent to know if it is relatively well paid or not.
