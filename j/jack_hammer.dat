5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, <b>Jack</b> <b>Hammer.</b> In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E
500|$|Alien {{had both}} an {{immediate}} and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut, Dan O'Bannon was sued by another writer named <b>Jack</b> <b>Hammer</b> for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled Black Space. However, O'Bannon was able {{to prove that he}} had written his Alien script first. In the wake of Alien success, a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by using [...] "Alien" [...] in titles. One of the first was The Alien Dead (1979), which had its title changed at the last minute to cash in on Alien popularity. Contamination (1980) was initially going to be titled Alien 2 until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director Luigi Cozzi and made him change it. The film built on Alien by having many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests. An unauthorized sequel to Alien, titled , was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate in humans. Other science fiction films of the time that borrowed elements from Alien include Galaxy of Terror (1981), Inseminoid (1981), Forbidden World (1982), Xtro (1982), and Dead Space (1991).|$|E

40|$|Wide flange precast/prestressed {{concrete}} I-girders {{have been}} widely used by several State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the last two decades. These girders have many advantages over standard AASHTO I-girders. Their wide and thick bottom flange accommodates a large number of prestressing strands and their wide and thin top flange provides a shorter deck span, reduced girder weight, greater stability in construction, and adequate platform for workers. Despite these advantages, the wide and thin top flange might be disadvantageous when it comes to deck removal, as it is more susceptible to damage. Therefore {{there is a need to}} investigate the impact of deck removal methods on the performance of the supporting wide flange I-girder. In this thesis, two deck removal methods are presented: saw cutting and <b>jack</b> <b>hammering.</b> The two methods were implemented on the Camp Creek Bridge over I- 80 in Lancaster County, NE before demolition due to its functional obsolesces. Different saw cutting and <b>jack</b> <b>hammering</b> techniques were performed for deck removal between girders and on top of girders. Data obtained from using similar techniques on three other projects were collected and analyzed. Two girders from the Camp Creek Bridge were taken to the lab for testing in flexure after applying different levels of deck removals around shear connectors and re-decking. Test results indicated adequate performance of the new composite section even when partial deck removal around shear connectors is applied. Another investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of top flange width on the performance of bridge I-girders. Top flange was assumed to be longitudinally saw cut and its width is reduced by fifty percent. The effects on geometrical properties, flexural capacity, horizontal shear capacity, and deflection were investigated analytically and experimentally under construction loads and service loads. Investigation results indicate that in some cases top flange width does not have significant impact on the structural performance of I-girders. Adviser: George Morcou...|$|R
