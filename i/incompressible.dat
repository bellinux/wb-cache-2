5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In <b>incompressible</b> flow, the velocity profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity profile is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} <b>incompressible</b> flows, where change in water density is {{negligible}} (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
25|$|Marker-and-cell method (Harlow and Welch, 1965). Fromm's vorticity-stream-function {{method for}} 2D, transient, <b>incompressible</b> flow {{was the first}} {{treatment}} of strongly contorting <b>incompressible</b> flows in the world.|$|E
25|$|The <b>in{{compressible}}</b> and {{compressible flow}} regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.|$|E
25|$|A 3-manifold {{is said to}} {{be small}} if it is closed, {{irreducible}} and does not contain any <b>incompressible</b> surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Note that, by the {{abundance}} of nearly <b>incompressible</b> strings, {{the vast majority of}} those statements must be true.|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} {{assumptions}} in the derivation of d'Alembert's paradox {{is that the}} steady flow is <b>incompressible,</b> inviscid and irrotational.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of nearly <b>incompressible</b> fluids {{such as water}} in the pore spaces affects the ability for the pores to dilate or contract.|$|E
25|$|Without {{mentioning}} it specifically, D later give {{what might}} be the required (above) justification while arguing that , an assumption that the solvent is <b>incompressible.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{axisymmetric}} flow another {{stream function}} formulation, called the Stokes stream function, {{can be used}} to describe the velocity components of an <b>incompressible</b> flow with one scalar function.|$|E
25|$|Theorem: With {{the uniform}} {{probability}} distribution {{on the space}} of bitstrings of length n, {{the probability that a}} string is <b>incompressible</b> by c is at least 1 - 2−c+1 + 2−n.|$|E
25|$|Thus every {{analytic}} function {{corresponds to a}} steady <b>incompressible,</b> irrotational fluid flow in the plane. The real part is the velocity potential, and the imaginary part is the stream function.|$|E
25|$|Under pressure, gases {{are highly}} {{compressible}} but liquids are almost <b>incompressible.</b> Air {{spaces in the}} diver's body and gas held in flexible equipment contract as the diver descends and expand as the diver ascends.|$|E
25|$|This number {{describes}} the range between flows {{that can be}} considered <b>incompressible</b> and flows where compressibility is important. Now the Mach number can be derived directly from the dimensionless form of the momentum equation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>in{{compressible}}</b> case is {{simpler than}} the compressible one so for didactical purpose {{it should be}} presented before. However, the compressible case is the most general framework of Navier–Stokes equations so where not specified, Navier–Stokes equations are intended to be compressible Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{pressure}}, {{along with}} the static pressure and the pressure due to elevation, is used in Bernoulli's principle as an energy balance on a closed system. The three terms are used to define the state of a closed system of an <b>incompressible,</b> constant-density fluid.|$|E
25|$|Compressible flow {{accounts}} for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as <b>incompressible,</b> i.e. the density {{is assumed to}} be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as <b>incompressible,</b> especially when studying <b>incompressible</b> flow. This <b>incompressible</b> nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} {{pressure}} {{forces from the}} governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves {{the role of a}} conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the <b>incompressible</b> pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same <b>incompressible</b> dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of <b>incompressible</b> dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of <b>incompressible</b> dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|Criticism : To explain {{universal}} gravitation, one {{is forced}} to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be <b>incompressible</b> to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances. And Maxwell argued that this process {{must be accompanied by}} a permanent new production and destruction of aether.|$|E
25|$|The Monro-Kellie {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} the cranial compartment is <b>incompressible</b> and that the volume inside the cranium is fixed. The cranium and its constituents (blood, CSF, and brain tissue) create a state of volume equilibrium, such that any increase in volume {{of one of the}} cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another.|$|E
25|$|The local {{speed of}} sound, {{and thereby the}} Mach number, depends on the {{condition}} of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature. The Mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an <b>incompressible</b> flow. The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a nozzle, diffusers or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number. If <nbsp&0.2–0.3 and the flow is quasi-steady and isothermal, compressibility effects will be small and simplified <b>incompressible</b> flow equations can be used.|$|E
25|$|All fluids are {{compressible}} to some extent; that is, {{changes in}} pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, {{in many situations}} the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an <b>incompressible</b> flow. Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used.|$|E
25|$|For {{fluid flow}} over a porous boundary, the fluid {{velocity}} can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the fluid in the porous media (this {{is related to}} the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low subsonic speeds to assume that a gas is <b>incompressible</b> — that is, the density of the gas does not change even though the speed and static pressure change.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumptions}} of the equation are that the fluid is <b>incompressible</b> and Newtonian; the flow is laminar through a pipe of constant circular cross-section that is substantially longer than its diameter; {{and there is no}} acceleration of fluid in the pipe. For velocities and pipe diameters above a threshold, actual fluid flow is not laminar but turbulent, leading to larger pressure drops than calculated by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often {{referred}} to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves {{on the surface of}} a homogeneous fluid layer. The theory assumes that the fluid layer has a uniform mean depth, and that the fluid flow is inviscid, <b>incompressible</b> and irrotational. This theory was first published, in correct form, by George Biddell Airy in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The <b>incompressible</b> Navier–Stokes {{equation}} is a differential algebraic equation, having the inconvenient feature {{that there is}} no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from {{all or part of the}} computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{there are}} several systems whose {{dynamical}} equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat. Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid, <b>incompressible,</b> homogeneous liquid, the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica theory, the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium, the Lorenz system in chaos theory, and the motion of an ion in a Penning trap mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Newton, but mathematically {{in greater}} detail, Bernhard Riemann assumed in 1853 that the {{gravitational}} aether is an <b>incompressible</b> fluid and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally {{to the masses}} within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into {{the direction of the}} central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal pumps {{of the style}} shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump working fluid is liquid (<b>incompressible).</b> Again, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal pump {{are the same as}} those to design a centrifugal compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with cavitation in pumps.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Luke's variational {{principle}} is a Lagrangian variational {{description of the}} motion of surface waves on a fluid with a free surface, under the action of gravity. This {{principle is}} named after J.C. Luke, who published it in 1967. This variational principle is for <b>incompressible</b> and inviscid potential flows, and is used to derive approximate wave models like the so-called mild-slope equation, or using the averaged Lagrangian approach for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media.|$|E
25|$|Subsonic (or low-speed) {{aerodynamics}} describes fluid {{motion in}} flows which are {{much lower than}} the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid, <b>incompressible</b> and irrotational. This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} idealization is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics. When the forces associated with two-dimensional, <b>incompressible,</b> irrotational, inviscid steady flow across a body are calculated, {{there is no}} drag. This is in contradiction with observations of such flows, but {{as it turns out}} a fluid that rigorously satisfies all the conditions is a physical impossibility. The mathematical model breaks down at the surface of the body, and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an <b>incompressible</b> fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E
25|$|The gel is thus {{interpreted}} as an elastic continuum, which deforms when subjected to externally applied shear forces, but is <b>incompressible</b> upon application of hydrostatic pressure. This combination of fluidity and rigidity is {{explained in terms of}} the gel structure: that of a liquid contained within a fibrous polymer network or matrix by the extremely large friction between the liquid and the fiber or polymer network. Thermal fluctuations may produce infinitesimal expansion or contraction within the network, and the evolution of such fluctuations will ultimately determine the molecular morphology and the degree of hydration of the body.|$|E
