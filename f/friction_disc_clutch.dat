With the intro-duction of new templates and standard components, Modelica has become increasingly accessible for researchers and students in the field of vehicle dy-namics and therefore a project was initiated to evalu-ate its usefulness as an educational tool. The general idea is to introduce Dymola in smaller assignments, aiming to familiarise the students with the basic functions of the tool while demonstrating its use through simulation examples. Four exercises were studied: a truck braking system model, a <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> <b>clutch</b> model, a controllable torque clutch model and a combined driver and vehicle model. The conclu-sions from this pilot study were that Dymola offers several ways to enhance the quality of vehicle engi-neering education, mainly due to the ease of model-ling and the rich animation functions which make the simulation exercises more interesting...|$|E

This project deals with an approach which takes into account the probabilistic nature of designs variables, as well as probability of satisfying constraint equations.

In this work, mathematical models of the friction clutch system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement).

40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of flywheel, <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> plate and <b>friction</b> material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to <b>friction</b> between the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result.

40|$|Somewhere in the {{transmission}} of vehicles today, a wet clutch can often be found. Characteristic {{of this type of}} clutch is that they operate under lubricated working conditions. In earlier research, friction characteristics and performance of wet clutches have been well investigated by several authors. Studies have also been made {{in order to understand the}} ageing of wet clutches. However, most lifetime studies have been made for systems with paperbased <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and systems involving sintered bronze <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> remain unexplored. <b>Friction</b> <b>discs</b> of sintered bronze is used in the Haldex limited slip coupling (LSC), an all-wheel drive system used in cars from many different manufacturers. In order to get a better understanding of how this system can change over time, the study in this master thesis is focused on how frictional performance is affected by oxidation of lubricant, testrig ageing and additive content. This work has been conducted in cooperation with Haldex Traction in Landskrona and Statoil Lubricants in Nynäshamn. The oxidation effects on friction performance was examined using a modified dry-TOST (Waterless Turbine Oil Oxidation Stability Test) on a fully formulated lubricant. The oxidation time period was divided into five steps from 48 hours to 408 h and for each level of oxidation, a friction performance test was run using a pin on disc machine. Also an oil aged in a <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> testrig was tested for friction performance. The test is constructed in order to verify that an oil- <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> combination will last the lifetime of the specific application. Since lubricant additives are vital to the performance of wet clutches the effect of reducing the additive concentration in the oil was also studied, in the range 10 to 100 % of the standard additive formulation. Results showed that a general friction increase can be seen for oxidation, additive reduction and testrig ageing. Lubricant aged in testrig shows significantly different friction characteristics with temperature than lubricants aged by dry-TOST implying that dry-TOST alone is not a sufficient method to evaluate lubricant ageing. Further research has to be made in order to understand the ageing of wet clutches. A better understanding of which mechanisms that are responsible for the decomposition of a lubricant in a wet clutch system such as the Haldex LSC is needed. This thesis has focused on lubricant ageing but no attention has been paid to wear and ageing of <b>friction</b> <b>discs.</b> To investigate and relate ageing of lubricant and <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> is another important task for future research.

50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates similar to the {{clutches}} in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|R

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} machinery such as in vehicles where they are used to distribute torque in the drivetrains. Clutches can be located in automatic transmissions or in limited slip differentials. The frictional behavior of a clutch is of great importance for overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally studied in test rigs where whole <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> or complete <b>clutches</b> are tested under similar working conditions to those pertaining to the clutches in the drivetrain of the vehicle. However, today clutch behavior may be simulated with regard to some clutch applications and design of the clutch system is not limited to testing. This is an advantage as it is possible to simulate behavior that may not be possible or suitable to study in a test rig. Another advantage is that the design process is faster and more cost efficient than that which is possible when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque transferred by the clutch during engagement can roughly be divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> are in direct contact, only separated by a thin additive film. The distribution between full film torque transfer and boundary lubrication torque transfer differs for different types of wet clutch and for differing operating conditions. When the clutch works in full film regime it is possible to simulate the friction quite well. However, the friction in the boundary lubrication regime is much more difficult to model and simulate since it is very dependent on the additives. Wet clutches are most commonly used in automatic transmissions for vehicles. As a result, most research into wet clutch testing and most simulations concerns wet clutches suitable for such applications. In an automatic transmission the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to stand still relative to another shaft and the total engagement has a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch is working in full film lubrication. In this thesis the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions: in other words this thesis studies clutches that are working {{with a small amount of}} slip over a long period without reaching a state of lock-up. These clutch types can be found, for example, in limited slip differentials. During this type of engagement the clutch mainly works under boundary lubrication conditions and much heat can be generated. The optimum method of designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch performance without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible, but an efficient way to design clutches can be achieved by combining simple measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this thesis, simple measurement techniques for wet clutch materials are developed and combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, which is dependent on the surface roughness and groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to optimize a wet clutch for given working conditions with regard to lubricant, friction material, surface roughness and groove pattern. The simulations are validated to measured data from a test rig in which torque behavior from whole <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> are investigated. Good agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved. Godkänd; 2008; 20080828 (ysko...|$|R
