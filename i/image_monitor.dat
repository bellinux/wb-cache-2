Great appreciation and support of the people on the ITU TV's weekly broadcast schedule ring opens. The interest in the coming years improve the broadcast quality. In this period, the first cameraman, the first announcer with the first light and sound technician crossed the history of Turkish television. First cameraman Adnan Ataman. The first decor two consist of brown and gray curtain. First newsreader and television presenter Fatih Pasiner. To improve the technical quality for of the building was erected antenna on October 17, 1959. In 1960, ITU TV has experienced stagnation period. The reason for the interruption is 1960 Turkish coup d'état. May 2, 1960 at 16.00 the ITU Radio and Television sealed by the police. Publications on 6 October 1960, started again. On November 17, 1960, the station has been switched to normal broadcasting. Live broadcasts take place in 1961. Channel, has moved to new premises on 5 December 1963. The power transmitter in 1963 increased to 500 Watts. Original first live broadcast on October 21, 1965 was the opening ceremony of the ITU TV. In fact, first live broadcast match took place on May 1, 1966. Television in the public sphere in Turkey was spoken. Began preparations for national television broadcasts in 1966 in Turkey. After preparation, the first closed-circuit broadcast was shown on the Assembly Budget Committee Date January 16, 1967. The first national television broadcast was made on January 31 mono 1968. First national television broadcast in mono format in Turkey was on January 31, 1968. TRT 1 began broadcasting on January 31, 1968. At the end of the 1960s was boycotted by television students. Makes the television broadcast ITU TV last 6 March 1970. on March 13 the broadcast is interrupted. TRT broadcasts began in 1971 in Istanbul, but using ITU TV materials. ITU TV in 1971 published in the last time match. ITU TV, did the last time television broadcast on May 19, 1971. After closing all the material he gave to TRT.|$|E

The stream receive unit supports multi capture source devices and multi-format stream compress encoder. Stream processor unit includes three modules; they are stream clipping module, image processing module and image management module.

Modern radiology uses different modalities to produce digital images which are to be viewed in different parts of the radiology department and throughout the hospital, sometimes simultaneously, via the Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS).

40|$|The {{site survey}} for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope {{concluded}} recently {{after more than}} two years of data gathering and analysis. Six locations, including lake, island and continental sites, were thoroughly probed for image quality and sky brightness. The present paper describes the analysis methodology employed to determine the height stratification of the atmospheric turbulence. This information is crucial because day-time seeing is often very different between the actual telescope aperture (~ 30 m) and the ground. Two independent inversion codes have been developed to analyze simultaneously data from a scintillometer array and a solar differential <b>image</b> <b>monitor.</b> We show here the results of applying them to a sample subset of data from May 2003, which was used for testing. Both codes retrieve a similar seeing stratification through the height range of interest. A quantitative comparison between our analysis procedure and actual in situ measurements confirms the validity of the inversions. The sample data presented in this paper reveal a qualitatively different behavior for the lake sites (dominated by high-altitude seeing) and the rest (dominated by near-ground turbulence) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{sodium iodide}} symporter (NIS) is an {{intrinsic}} plasma membrane protein that mediates active iodide transport into the thyroid gland and into several extrathyroidal tissues, {{in particular the}} lactating mammary gland. Cloning and molecular characterization of the NIS have allowed the investigation of its key role in thyroid physiology {{as well as its}} potential pathophysiological and therapeutic implications in benign and malignant thyroid diseases. Similarly, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NIS in lactating mammary gland and breast cancer, in which more than 80 % of cases express endogenous NIS, may lead to findings that have novel implications for pathophysiology and therapy. Two approaches may, in the future, pave the way to extend the use of radioiodide treatment to nonthyroidal cancer. One is based on the reinduction of endogenous NIS expression in thyroid and breast cancer by targeting the main mechanisms involving tumoral transformation and dedifferentiation. The other is based on the application of NIS as a novel cytoreductive gene therapy strategy. NIS offers the unique advantage that it can be used both as a reporter and as a therapeutic gene, so {{that it is possible to}} <b>image,</b> <b>monitor,</b> and treat the tumor with radioiodide, just as in differentiated thyroid cancer. This review summarizes the main recent findings in NIS research that have a direct impact on diagnosis and therapeutic management. © 2006 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.
