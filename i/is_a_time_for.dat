2500|$|A good plot is an {{exercise}} in proper balance. [...] By staying aware of the scenes' levels of intensity and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers. [...] Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight. [...] However, in writing fiction, they are in charge of the way time moves. [...] They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely. [...] Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about. [...] There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> telling and a time for showing. [...] Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly. [...] On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace. [...] Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension. [...] In the rising action of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene. [...] The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.|$|E
2500|$|The 8th Virginia Regiment {{was raised}} {{beginning}} on 11 January 1776 for service with the Virginia State Troops.

[...] He removed his clerical robes to show that he was wearing his uniform as a militia colonel. He quickly enlisted 300 men from his congregation in the unit that became the 8th Virginia. Muhlenberg was appointed colonel on 1 March 1776. The 8th Virginia organized at Suffolk County Court House between 9 February and 4 April 1776. The unit's 10 companies came from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore, Fincastle, Frederick, and Hampshire Counties, plus the District of West Augusta.

[...] In 2013, The Seattle Times wrote that Rolf's mission is to persuade the more traditional leaders within the movement [...] "to accept that innovation is your new religion". He advocates for the use of social networking services by unions in order to engage young people, and believes that, like corporations, unions must invest in development, entrepreneurship and research in order to be successful in their efforts. Rolf believes [...] "a completely new and disruptive force" [...] is necessary to help the middle class, which will require [...] "bold moral and economic choices". He criticizes corporations that outsource or subcontract workers on a low-wage, part-time or temporary basis in order to avoid paying for the benefits required for full-time employees. Rolf has expressed concern about increased student loan debt, cost of housing increases that are greater than family income increases, and payroll tax increases during a time of simultaneous corporate tax decreases, and he is critical of trickle-down economics. He advocates for a $15-per-hour minimum wage to help address these issues. Rolf believes that minimum wage increases help local and small businesses.|$|E
