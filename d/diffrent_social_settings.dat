40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the reflexive interplay between individual decisions and social forces {{to analyze the}} evolution of cooperation {{in the presence of}} “multi-directedness,” whereby people's preferences depend on their psychological motives. People have access to multiple, discrete motives. Different motives may be activated by different <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> Inter-individual differences in dispositional types affect the responsiveness of people's motives to their <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> The evolution of these dispositional types is driven by changes in the frequencies of <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> In this context, economic policies can influence economic decisions not merely by modifying incentives operating through given preferences, but also by influencing people's motives (thereby changing their preferences) and by changing the distribution of dispositional types in the population (thereby changing their motivational responsiveness to <b>social</b> <b>settings)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We study {{prudence}} and temperance (next to risk aversion) in <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> Previous {{experimental studies}} have shown that these higher-order risk preferences affect the choices of individuals deciding privately on lotteries that only affect their own payoff. Yet, many risky and financially relevant decisions are made in the <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> of households or organizations. We elicit higher-order risk preferences of individuals and systematically vary how an individual’s decision is made (alone or while communicating with a partner) and who is affected by the decision (only the individual or the partner as well). In doing so, we can isolate the effects of other-regarding concerns and communication on choices. Our results reveal that the majority of choices are risk averse, prudent, and temperate across <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> We also observe that individuals are influenced significantly by the preferences of a partner when they are able to communicate and choices are payoff-relevant for both of them...|$|R

40|$|A mailed {{survey of}} {{scientists}} and engineers with disabilities was conducted to investigate how assistive devices for disability utilized in various <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> were perceived by persons with disabilities who also maintained valuable occupational positions. The respondents (N = 595) reported assistive-device utilization in <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> and user attitudes toward using assistive mechanical aids. The minority-group conceptual framework guided analysis of assistive technology {{as a symbol of}} disability. Variations in device use within public and private settings and differences in attitudes according to demographic and disability characteristics also are described. Findings show general user satisfaction with devices. Utilization varies among <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> and also varies by disability type, especially between persons with sensory impairment and those with nonsensory impairment. Public responses were not perceived to be problematic, although users do indicate that the actual application of devices may be unsatisfactory. User's suggestions for further research chiefly propose examination of the systems that develop and distribute assistive devices. results encourage examination of socioeconomic arrangements that reinforce the minority position of people with disabilities by restricting access to aids perceived as beneficial to social roles. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent {{research}} has shown that experiences of stigmatization have an adverse impact on the psychological well being of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Most studies investigating this relationship employ an aggregate measure of stigma. Although this approach provides useful information about the psychological implications of HIV-related stigma in general, it neglects to acknowledge the possibility that some manifestations in specific settings may be psychologically more detrimental than others. The present study examines which specific stigma experiences are most strongly related to psychological distress across a number of <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 667 PLWHA in the Netherlands. We examined participants' experiences of 11 manifestations of HIV-related stigma in six <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine which setting-specific manifestations best predict psychological distress after controlling for marital status, education and health status. RESULTS: Three manifestations in family settings, namely receiving advice to conceal one's status, being avoided and being treated with exaggerated kindness, and one manifestation in healthcare <b>settings,</b> namely awkward <b>social</b> interaction, best predicted psychological distress in PLWHA. CONCLUSION: Manifestations of HIV-related stigma vary according to setting. Certain manifestations in specific <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> impact the psychological well being of PLWHA more than others. In this study, certain experiences of stigmatization with PLWHA's families and in healthcare settings were more strongly related to psychological distress than experiences occurring in other <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> These findings suggest that stigma reduction interventions focusing on these influential settings may benefit the psychological well being of PLWHA...|$|R

40|$|Any {{assessment}} {{of the state of}} human relations in the Chicago region needs to be multidimensional. At its most basic, such an assessment involves the quality of relationships, or relations, among individuals. Relations may manifest themselves in families, among friends, within neighborhoods, or in work, religious, educational, recreational or other <b>social</b> <b>settings.</b> There are no widely accepted measures of the quality of human relations, in part because different commentators view the subject differently. Quality human relations may have several outcomes: for people to be satisfied or experience a good quality of life; for people to be supportive and helpful to one another; or for people to treat one another fairly and equally. In some <b>social</b> <b>settings,</b> individuals with common characteristics share a common fate or have similar life experiences and opportunities. Other <b>social</b> <b>settings</b> are marked more by differences among groups than commonalities. Such differences can be readily observed in the cases of different racial, ethnic, age or language groups; among persons sharing a gender or sexual orientation; or among the disabled. These social groupings seem to have the most impact on people's condition and identity...|$|R
