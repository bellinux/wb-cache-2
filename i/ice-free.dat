5|$|A road up Stjørdalen {{was built}} during the 1850s, {{connecting}} at Stjørdalshalsen to a steam ship service to Trondheim. A concern in Sweden was that Bottenviken could freeze {{up and that}} the Trondheimsfjord offered an <b>ice-free</b> alternative for export of timber.|$|E
5|$|The ML fleet {{was joined}} by two new smaller 5,600 grt vessels, the Manchester Port and Manchester Merchant during 1899 and 1900, and further new vessels {{followed}} quickly thereafter. The basic sailing pattern to Canada was St John, New Brunswick, year-round and to Montreal when the St Lawrence River was <b>ice-free.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of the North Atlantic Current also ensures the coastline of Ireland remains <b>ice-free</b> throughout the winter. The climate in Ireland does not experience extreme weather, with tornadoes and similar weather features being rare.|$|E
5|$|Polar deserts such as McMurdo Dry Valleys remain <b>ice-free</b> {{because of}} the dry {{katabatic}} winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains. Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments, such as the Sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts. In the Köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as BWh (hot desert) or BWk (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round <b>ice-free</b> areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's <b>ice-free</b> land with about half of these {{occurring}} in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} its own bus line, and is the northernmost year-round <b>ice-free</b> port in the country, a {{shipping}} base for western and northwestern Greenland. Supply ships head from the commercial port towards smaller settlements in more remote regions of Uummannaq Fjord, Upernavik Archipelago, {{and as far as}} Qaanaaq in northern Greenland. The town airport is served by Air Greenland, providing connections to other towns on the western coast of Greenland, and through Kangerlussuaq Airport, to Europe.|$|E
5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack of {{sufficient}} year-round <b>ice-free</b> ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was <b>ice-free</b> because of low snowfall, {{allowing}} a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the <b>ice-free</b> harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|However, {{studies of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{indicate that the}} russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in <b>ice-free</b> refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's <b>ice-free</b> land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Progress, 5,620 grt, {{opened a}} regular mid-summer service to Churchill, Manitoba on Hudson Bay in 1954, during the short <b>ice-free</b> season, {{bringing}} back grain {{shipped to the}} port by rail from the Canadian Prairies. Captain F. Struss, survivor of sinkings in both wars, retired in March 1954 after forty years service, the last ML Commodore who had gained his master's ticket in sail. That same year the Great Lakes service was extended to Chicago, and ML's pre-1914 service to the southern US ports of Charleston, Savannah, and Jacksonville was resumed.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Tartu, {{confirming}} the new Finnish-Soviet border {{as the old}} border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper. In addition, Finland received Petsamo, with its <b>ice-free</b> harbour on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty did not prevent the Finnish government from allowing volunteers {{to cross the border}} to support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in Finland. In 1923 both countries signed the Border Peace Agreement, which normalized the border.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain <b>ice-free</b> even in winter.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable <b>ice-free</b> water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|The present-day cone of Mount Baker is {{relatively}} young; {{it is perhaps}} less than 100,000years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000years ago. Much of Mount Baker's earlier geological record eroded away during {{the last ice age}} (which culminated 15,000–20,000years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000years, the area around the mountain has been largely <b>ice-free,</b> but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely <b>ice-free,</b> well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} year, Sisimiut {{is served}} twice-weekly by coastal ferries of Arctic Umiaq Line which link the {{communities}} of the western coast. There is also a weekly Royal Arctic Line ferry to Itilleq and Sarfannguit. The port in Sisimiut is the northernmost year-round <b>ice-free</b> port in Greenland, serving as the country's primary maritime base north of Nuuk. Supply ships from the port head north, serving the entire coast, from the Uummannaq Fjord region, through Upernavik Archipelago, to Qaanaaq in the far north. M/S Akamalik, {{one of the largest}} ships in the fleet of Royal Greenland, is based in Sisimiut. Home to the first shipyard of Greenland dating from 1931, the port also handles more than 50 cruise liners per year. The local kayak club operates at the bay harbor east of the port.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Öland was {{the first}} of several major Swedish defeats at sea that ended in {{complete}} Danish dominance over the southern Baltic {{for the duration of the}} Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an <b>ice-free</b> harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become Karlskrona. The lessons from the war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of Hans Wachtmeister (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment of skilled personnel through the allotment system.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either <b>ice-free</b> areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast or through an interior <b>ice-free</b> corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas, in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain <b>ice-free</b> breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's <b>ice-free</b> land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{island of}} Greenland, {{although}} its ice sheet and <b>ice-free</b> coastal regions have different climatic conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Late Cretaceous {{period was}} likely <b>ice-free,</b> with {{implications}} for Earth's future climate, based on new research.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, {{livestock}} production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the <b>ice-free</b> land {{surface of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio River is a climatic {{transition}} area, as {{its water}} {{runs along the}} periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely further south toward Cincinnati and Louisville. At Paducah, Kentucky, in the south, near the Ohio's confluence with the Mississippi, it is <b>ice-free</b> year-round. Paducah was founded there because it is the northernmost <b>ice-free</b> reach of the Ohio.|$|E
25|$|The {{area has}} a {{relatively}} mild climate due to geographical factors, and the town's <b>ice-free</b> harbour {{has played a}} significant role in its history.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} at least five major ice ages in the earth's past (the Huronian, Cryogenian, Andean-Saharan, Karoo Ice Age and the Quaternary glaciation). Outside these ages, the Earth seems to have been <b>ice-free</b> even in high latitudes.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of the lower salinity of the bay is that the freezing point of the water is {{higher than in the}} rest of the world's oceans, thus decreasing the time that the bay remains <b>ice-free.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manitoba was {{the first}} Canadian {{province}} {{to be involved in}} the wheat industry. There are only three <b>ice-free</b> months a year that allow for the shipments to be sent when shipping through the home port of Churchill.|$|E
25|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{settled in}} the area that is now Edmonton, Alberta, Canada around 3,000BC and perhaps as early as 10,000BC, when an <b>ice-free</b> corridor opened up as the last ice age ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.|$|E
25|$|In civil aircraft, bleed air's {{primary use}} {{is to provide}} {{pressure}} for the aircraft cabin by supplying air to the environmental control system. Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the plane (such as the wing leading edges) <b>ice-free.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the Mackenzie River is <b>ice-free,</b> Northern Transportation Company Limited {{provides}} a commercial barge service from Hay River, on Great Slave Lake {{to the regional}} terminal in Inuvik. The annual sealift moves supplies as far east as Taloyoak, Nunavut and west to Barrow, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Kaliningrad Oblast's {{economy is}} {{positively}} influenced by several factors, such as <b>ice-free</b> ports, the world's largest amber deposits and proximity to European countries. The region {{also has a}} developed tourist infrastructure, unique museums and monuments, and tourist attractions. One {{of these is the}} Curonian Spit.|$|E
