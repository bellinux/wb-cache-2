5|$|All {{surviving}} sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is {{not known}} whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{gain more}} control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accuses Stromm of {{embezzlement}} and has his partner arrested.

The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into destructive insanity.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> {{present the}} {{character}} as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in Beware the Batman was radially redesigned as entirely white, {{in contrast to}} Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art of Rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> teach him morality.|$|E
5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E

Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began on June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace.

5|$|Scholars face several {{problems}} <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> connect Khaba to royal names {{known from the}} Ramesside era (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the number or names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives Nebka, Djoser, Teti, Sedjes, and Neferkarê, while the Turin Canon offers Nebka, Djoser, Djoserteti, Hudjefa, and Huni. The kinglist of Saqqara lists Djoser, Djoserteti, Nebkarê, and Huni. The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: Necheróphes, Tosorthrós, Týreis, Mesôchris, Sôÿphis, Tósertasis, Achês, Sêphuris, and Kerpherês. Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside cartouche name Teti.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one.

While Shea did his part <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
