5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and <b>emaciation.</b> Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, <b>emaciation,</b> diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause <b>emaciation,</b> salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E
25|$|Chronic Fasciolosis: {{infectious}} dose is 200-800 ingested metacercariae. Asymptomatic or gradual {{development of}} bottle jaw and ascites (ventral edema), <b>emaciation,</b> weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Following {{international}} protest involving prominent Italians including Benito Mussolini and the Vatican, surviving prisoners {{older than}} 40, were released on February 8, 1940. More academics were released later. However, {{over a dozen}} died in captivity, including Stanisław Estreicher, and several others right after their return, owing to <b>emaciation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The trypanosomes are {{injected}} into vertebrate muscle tissue, but make their way, {{first into the}} lymphatic system, then into the bloodstream, and eventually into the brain. The disease causes the swelling of the lymph glands, <b>emaciation</b> of the body, and eventually leads to death. Uninfected tsetse may bite the infected animal prior to its death and acquire the disease, thereby closing the transmission cycle.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{specific}} symptoms or signs of hookworm infection, but they {{give rise to}} a combination of intestinal inflammation and progressive iron-deficiency anemia and protein deficiency. Coughing, chest pain, wheezing, and fever will sometimes result from severe infection. Epigastric pains, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea can occur early or in later stages as well, although gastrointestinal symptoms tend to improve with time. Signs of advanced severe infection are those of anemia and protein deficiency, including <b>emaciation,</b> cardiac failure and abdominal distension with ascites.|$|E
25|$|Wombats {{have been}} {{considered}} as agricultural pests by landholders. Their digging can destroy crops and can {{increase the risk of}} livestock breaking their legs by falling though their burrow systems. Competition between livestock, rabbits, and wombats can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which wombats cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of <b>emaciation</b> and mass starvation. The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of wombats.|$|E
500|$|The ships {{set sail}} for Rio de Janeiro, {{arriving}} there on 10 September when the slaves {{were transferred to}} the hulk Crescent {{under the supervision of}} Sir Thomas Paisley. [...] Paisley said that he had [...] "never witnessed anything so shocking", particularly as most of the slaves were suffering from <b>emaciation</b> and sores and others were infected by smallpox and had to be quarantined aboard the Vincedora. [...] The slaves included parentless children, babies and a harem of women for the brigantine's crew. [...] Although the slaves continued to die over the next month, most recovered to be set free. [...] The event was recorded in the memoirs of Sir Astley Cooper Key.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large number}} of jokes are about distrofiks, people with severe muscular dystrophy. The main themes are the extreme weakness, slowness, gauntness, and <b>emaciation</b> of a {{dystrophic}} patient. Some of the jibes originated in jokes about Gulag camps. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Gulag Archipelago, wrote that dystrophy was a typical phase {{in the life of}} a Gulag inmate, and quotes the following joke: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals {{her as a}} sickly infant. [...] "Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing {{we seem to have}} a hope of recovery. The {{diarrhoea}} has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the <b>emaciation</b> is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing." [...] He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been [...] "pretty occupied" [...] with the girl's care. Domitia would die in 151.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{syndrome}} involves {{a lack of}} essential fat, {{more than half of}} those diagnosed are underweight, sometimes to the point of sickliness and <b>emaciation.</b> [...] Females are impacted more often than males, and while {{the syndrome}} can occur at any age, it is most frequently diagnosed in early adulthood. [...] The most common co-morbid conditions include mental and behavioral disorders including eating disorders and depression, infectious diseases including tuberculosis and acute gastroenteritis, and nervous system diseases including muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy.|$|E
2500|$|Since females {{between the}} ages of 10 and 30 are most {{frequently}} afflicted, {{it is not uncommon for}} physicians to initially and incorrectly assume that <b>emaciation</b> is a choice of the patient instead of a consequence of SMA syndrome. [...] Patients in the earlier stages of SMA syndrome often remain unaware that they are ill until substantial damage to their health is done, since they may attempt to adapt to the condition by gradually decreasing their food intake or naturally gravitating toward a lighter and more digestible diet.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{criticism}} {{sessions were}} {{often used to}} intimidate the peasants into obeying local cadres; they increased the death rate of the famine in several ways, according to Thaxton. [...] "In the first case, blows to the body caused internal injuries that, in combination with physical <b>emaciation</b> and acute hunger, could induce death." [...] In one case, after a peasant stole two cabbages from the common fields, the thief was publicly criticized for half a day. He collapsed, fell ill, and never recovered. Others were sent to labor camps.|$|E
2500|$|According to Walter Gratzer, {{the study}} of {{nutrition}} probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or [...] "wind" [...] similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into [...] "hot" [...] (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and [...] "cold" [...] (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets. About {{the same time in}} Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or <b>emaciation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Elisabeth became even more restless and obsessive, {{weighing}} herself up to three times a day. She regularly took steam baths to prevent weight gain; by 1894 she had wasted away to near <b>emaciation,</b> reaching her lowest point of 95.7lbs (43.5kg). There were some aberrations in Elisabeth's diet that appear to be signs of binge eating, On one occasion in 1878 the Empress astonished her travelling companions when she unexpectedly visited a restaurant incognito, where she drank champagne, ate a broiled chicken and an Italian salad, and finished with a [...] "considerable quantity of cake". She may have satisfied her urge to binge in secret on other occasions; in 1881 she purchased an English country house and had a spiral staircase built from her living room into the kitchen, so that she could reach it in private.|$|E
2500|$|L. donovani is the causative {{agent of}} visceral leishmaniasis, {{traditionally}} known as kala-azar ("black fever", particularly in India), {{because of its}} characteristic symptoms. The disease is highly lethal if not treated properly. The incubation period generally ranges from 3 to 6 months, {{and in some cases}} may be over a year. In Indian leishmaniasis, incubation can be as short as 10 days. The target cells are those of mononuclear phagocyte system. The two main tissues of infection are spleen and liver. Clinical symptoms include pyrexia (recurring high fever which may be continuous or remittent), enlargement of spleen and liver, and heavy skin pigmentation which darkens the physical appearance (the reason for naming [...] "black fever"). To a lesser extent mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes are also invaded by the parasite. Morphological symptoms are noticeable particularly on facial and abdominal regions. Skin becomes coarse and hard. In African infections, warty eruptions are common. In a fully developed stage, the patient shows <b>emaciation</b> and anaemia. Where medical facilities are poor, mortality can be as high as 75–95% within 2 years of epidemics. The disease is often accompanied by complications with dysentery, tuberculosis, septicaemia and even HIV infection.|$|E
2500|$|Thin Sow Syndrome (TSS) is a {{behavior}} observed in stalled sows {{that is similar}} to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from <b>emaciation,</b> hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness and hyperactivity. [...] The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors. [...] Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors. [...] However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning. When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously. It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow. Affected sows have poor appetite but often show pica, excessive water intake (polydipsia) and are anemic.|$|E

60|$|Miss Cynthia {{followed}} the doctor {{down the long}} ward. When he paused by a cot, she pushed past him. Wilbur lay tossing restlessly on his pillow. He was thin to <b>emaciation,</b> but his cheeks were crimson and his eyes burning bright.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{brothers}} Sol and Dan {{did most}} of the actual work,' said Ethelberta, 'though I drew the outlines, and designed the tiles round the fire. The flowers, mice, and spiders are done very simply, you know: you only press a real flower, mouse, or spider out flat under a piece of glass, and then copy it, adding a little more <b>emaciation</b> and angularity at pleasure.' ...|$|E
60|$|When Lydgate came in, she {{was almost}} shocked at the change in his face, which was strikingly {{perceptible}} to her who had not seen him for two months. It was not the change of <b>emaciation,</b> but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency. Her cordial look, when she put out her hand to him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.|$|E
60|$|Whilst Angela {{was talking}} to Pigott, Sir John and Lady Bellamy were paying a call at Isleworth. They found George lying on the sofa in the dining-room, in which, though {{it was the first}} week in June, a fire was burning on the hearth. He bore all the signs of a man in the last stage of consumption. The hollow cough, the <b>emaciation,</b> and the hectic hue upon his face, all spoke with no {{uncertain}} voice.|$|E
60|$|Stevie {{was staring}} at the horse, whose hind {{quarters}} appeared unduly elevated by the effect of <b>emaciation.</b> The little stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke; and at the other end the thin, flat neck, like a plank covered with old horse-hide, drooped to the ground under the weight of an enormous bony head. The ears hung at different angles, negligently; and the macabre figure of that mute dweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the muggy stillness of the air.|$|E
60|$|Here the {{previous}} speaker, rotund, dignified, and elderly, alighted indignantly, closely {{followed by the}} rest of the party, two ladies and a gentleman. One of the ladies was past the age, but not the fashion, of youth, and her Parisian dress clung over her wasted figure and well-bred bones artistically if not gracefully; the younger lady, evidently her daughter, was crisp and pretty, and carried off the aquiline nose and aristocratic <b>emaciation</b> of her mother with a certain piquancy and a dash that was charming. The gentleman was young, thin, with the family characteristics, but otherwise indistinctive.|$|E
60|$|Course after {{course was}} {{served by the}} supernumerous waiters. Grandemont, {{inspired}} {{by the results of}} André's exquisite skill in cookery and his own in the selection of wines became the model host, talkative, witty, and genial. The guest was fitful in conversation. His mind seemed to be sustaining a succession of waves of dementia followed by intervals of comparative lucidity. There was the glassy brightness of recent fever in his eyes. A long course of {{it must have been the}} cause of his <b>emaciation</b> and weakness, his distracted mind, and the dull pallor that showed even through the tan of wind and sun.|$|E
60|$|Does {{not this}} speak {{of dirt and}} {{disorder}} we cannot suffer to continue, of women ill trained for motherhood and worked beyond care for cleanliness, of {{a vast amount of}} preventable suffering? And these figures of filth and bad clothing are paralleled by others at least equally impressive, displaying <b>emaciation,</b> under-nutrition, anæmia and every other painful and wretched consequence of neglect and insufficiency. These underfed, under-clothed, undersized children are also the backward children; they grow up through a darkened, joyless childhood into a grey, perplexing, hopeless world that beats them down at last, after servility, after toil, after crime it may be and despair, to death.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was because}} he had talked long with the steward who had left the ship, that Dag Daughtry {{recognized}} and identified {{each of the four}} men. That, surely, was the [...] "Ancient Mariner," [...] sitting back and apart with washed eyes of such palest blue that they seemed a faded white. Long thin wisps of silvery, unkempt hair framed his face like an aureole. He was slender to <b>emaciation,</b> cavernously checked, roll after roll of skin, no longer encasing flesh or muscle, hanging grotesquely down his neck and swathing the Adam's apple so that only occasionally, with queer swallowing motions, did it peep out of the mummy-wrappings of skin and sink back again from view.|$|E
60|$|She {{was dressed}} very prettily {{for the opening}} night of the Drawing Academy, wearing a {{delicate}} lace cap, and a new silk gown of Valentine's choosing, made full enough to hide the <b>emaciation</b> of her figure. Her husband's love, faithful through all affliction and change to the girlish image of its first worship, still affectionately exacted from her as {{much attention to the}} graces and luxuries of dress as she might have bestowed on them of her own accord, in the best and gayest days of youth and health. She had never looked happier and better in any new gown than in that, which Mr. Blyth had insisted on giving her, to commemorate the establishment of the domestic drawing school in her own room.|$|E
60|$|Was it my own excited imagination--or {{the misty}} {{influence}} of the atmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the gray draperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; and I--not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her person. Alas! its <b>emaciation</b> was excessive, and not one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning glances at length fell upon the face.|$|E
60|$|The third {{point to}} be {{considered}} {{with respect to the}} corporeal expression of mental character is, that there is a certain period of the soul culture when it begins to interfere with some of the characters of typical beauty belonging to the bodily frame, the stirring of the intellect wearing down the flesh, and the moral enthusiasm burning its way out to heaven, through the <b>emaciation</b> of the earthen vessel; and that there is, in this indication of subduing of the mortal by the immortal part, an ideal glory of perhaps a purer and higher range than that of the more perfect material form. We conceive, I think, more nobly of the weak presence of Paul, than of the fair and ruddy countenance of Daniel.|$|E
60|$|I {{received}} this note within {{half an hour}} after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the <b>emaciation</b> was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and {{a certain degree of}} physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some palliative medicines without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.|$|E
60|$|Feeling well heated by this time, Deronda {{gave up the}} oar {{and drew}} over him again his Inverness cape. As he lifted up his head while {{fastening}} the topmost button his eyes caught a well-remembered face looking toward him over the parapet of the bridge--brought out by the western light into startling distinctness and brilliancy--an illuminated type of bodily <b>emaciation</b> and spiritual eagerness. It was the face of Mordecai, who also, in his watch toward the west, had {{caught sight of the}} advancing boat, and had kept it fast within his gaze, at first simply because it was advancing, then with a recovery of impressions that made him quiver as with a presentiment, till at last the nearing figure lifted up its face toward him--the face of his visions--and then immediately, with white uplifted hand, beckoned again and again.|$|E
60|$|Two candles {{were burning}} on the {{stand-up}} desk. Mr. Jones, tightly enfolded {{in an old}} but gorgeous blue silk dressing-gown, kept his elbows close against his sides and his hands deeply plunged into the extraordinarily deep pockets of the garment. The costume accentuated his <b>emaciation.</b> He resembled a painted pole leaning {{against the edge of}} the desk, with a dried head of dubious distinction stuck on the top of it. Ricardo lounged in the doorway. Indifferent in appearance to what was going on, he was biding his time. At a given moment, between two flickers of lightning, he melted out of his frame into the outer air. His disappearance was observed on the instant by Mr. Jones, who abandoned his nonchalant immobility against the desk, and made a few steps calculated to put him between Heyst and the doorway.|$|E
6000|$|Three of {{them were}} gaunt and brown, the fourth was gaunt and pale, with signs of fever and ague upon him. One had a great scar down his temple; one limped; and they all had unnaturally large bright eyes, showing <b>emaciation.</b> There were no bands {{greeting}} them at the stations, no banks of gaily dressed ladies waving hand-kerchiefs and shouting [...] "Bravo!" [...] as they came in on the caboose of a freight tram into the towns that had cheered and blared at them {{on their way to}} war. As they looked out or stepped upon the platform for a moment, as the train stood at the station, the loafers looked at them indifferenfly. Their blue coats, dusty and grimy, were too familiar now to excite notice, much less a friendly word. They were the last of the army to return, and the loafers were surfeited with such sights.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yesterday, however, just as I was {{thinking}} of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, {{with the name of}} 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this <b>emaciation</b> seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.|$|E
