5|$|Both the {{original}} 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots {{found in the}} PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one <b>FireWire</b> 400 port, while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports {{as well as one}} <b>FireWire</b> 400 port. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with <b>FireWire</b> 800 or S-Video ports, although <b>FireWire</b> 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision and is present in every version of the 17-inch design. S-Video capability can be attained {{through the use of a}} DVI to S-Video adapter. External displays with up to a 2,560×1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port. All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g. Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2.1.|$|E
5|$|For {{external}} connectivity, the Mac Pro included five USB 2.0 ports, two <b>FireWire</b> 400 and two <b>FireWire</b> 800 (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four <b>FireWire</b> 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
5|$|USB {{runs with}} a 5V power line, while <b>FireWire</b> in current {{implementations}} supplies 12V and theoretically can supply up to 30V.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{and drivers}} used to {{implement}} USB and <b>FireWire</b> have a crucial {{impact on how}} much of the bandwidth prescribed by the specification is achieved in the real world, along with compatibility with peripherals.|$|E
5|$|A USB network {{relies on}} a single host {{at the top of}} the tree to control the network. All {{communications}} are between the host and one peripheral. In a <b>FireWire</b> network, any capable node can control the network.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB hub ports {{can provide}} from the typical 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports. USB3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8A/9.0W (for {{dedicated}} battery charging, 1.5A/7.5W full bandwidth or 900mA/4.5W high bandwidth), while <b>FireWire</b> can in theory supply up to 60watts of power, although 10 to 20watts is more typical.|$|E
5|$|The ports {{are all on}} {{the left}} edge; on early models, from left to right, they are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, mini-DVI, <b>FireWire</b> 400, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (<b>FireWire)</b> technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{brought a}} 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and {{integrated}} Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, {{and the removal of}} the <b>FireWire</b> 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while <b>FireWire</b> was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a <b>Firewire</b> port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks <b>FireWire</b> and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no <b>FireWire</b> 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models. The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbit/s, which is up to {{twice as fast as}} the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than <b>FireWire</b> 800. Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for <b>FireWire</b> or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, {{as most of}} them did not have <b>FireWire</b> ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of <b>FireWire,</b> although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using <b>FireWire</b> for data transfer (while still allowing for use of <b>FireWire</b> to charge the device) {{in an attempt to}} reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, <b>FireWire</b> charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and charging port for the dock/cable.|$|E
25|$|On a USB flash drive, {{one end of}} {{the device}} is fitted with a single Standard-A USB plug; some flash drives {{additionally}} offer a micro USB plug, facilitating data transfers between different devices. Flash drives with a USB-C interface and other not so common interfaces (such as <b>FireWire</b> 400, <b>FireWire</b> 800, and ThunderBolt) are also available.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} fears that Intel, which {{took part in}} the {{development}} and implementation of the USB, would force Apple to drop all development and support of its <b>FireWire</b> serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as <b>FireWire</b> ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the MacBook Air in 2008, until being replaced by the faster Thunderbolt port.|$|E
25|$|IEEE 1394 (aka <b>Firewire)</b> {{audio support}} {{is slated for}} a future release of Windows Vista, to be {{implemented}} as a full class driver, automatically supporting IEEE 1394 AV/C audio devices.|$|E
25|$|Originally, a <b>FireWire</b> {{connection}} to the host computer was used to update songs or recharge the battery. The battery could also be charged with a power adapter that was included with the first four generations.|$|E
25|$|The I/O ports {{were changed}} with the early 2009 revision. A fifth USB 2.0 port was added and the <b>FireWire</b> 400 port was {{replaced}} with a <b>FireWire</b> 800 port. The AirPort card was upgraded to 802.11a/b/g/draft-n and later to 802.11a/b/g/n. Bluetooth was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1. Instead of a single full-size DVI port, a Mini-DVI port was added along with a Mini DisplayPort connection, which allows dual display support. Unlike the DVI port, the Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560×1600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display with the Mac Mini. As of this revision, the Apple Remote is no longer included with the Mac Mini.|$|E
25|$|Serial ATA (SATA). The SATA {{data cable}} has one data pair for {{differential}} {{transmission of data}} to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like EIA-422. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar differential signaling system is used in RS485, LocalTalk, USB, <b>FireWire,</b> and differential SCSI.|$|E
25|$|Features such as {{biometric}} security or multiple interfaces (for example, <b>Firewire)</b> {{are available at}} a higher cost. There are pre-assembled external hard disk drives that, when taken out from their enclosures, cannot be used internally in a laptop or desktop computer due to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards, and lack of SATA (or Parallel ATA) interfaces.|$|E
25|$|Many {{personal}} computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adaptor. Adaptors {{exist for the}} PC card, ExpressBus, USB, <b>FireWire,</b> and the parallel printer port. Active adaptors also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as CompactFlash. The FlashPath adaptor lets SD cards {{be used in a}} floppy disk drive.|$|E
25|$|Further {{releases}} in 2006 {{include the}} Duende DSP, platform designed to emulate SSL console-grade audio quality for home recording enthusiasts. Based on the digital technology behind SSL's C-Series consoles, Duende {{is designed to}} integrate into Digital audio workstation environments using a <b>FireWire</b> cable connection, though a PCI-e card is also available. The digital processing channels appear as audio plug-ins. The system supports Steinberg VST, Apple Audio Units and Digidesign RTAS, (support via Fxpansion wrapper).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Intel-based Mac Mini {{includes four}} USB 2.0 ports and one <b>FireWire</b> 400 port. Networking is supported {{with a built-in}} Gigabit Ethernet port and an integrated 802.11b/g AirPort card. Bluetooth was also made standard. External displays are supported through a DVI port. While the Mac Mini G4 supports only analog audio output, the Intel-based Mac Mini has separate Mini-TOSLINK/3.5mm mini-jacks that support both analog audio input and output as well optical digital S/PDIF input and output.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{intended}} {{to grow the}} Pippin platform alongside {{the rest of the}} Macintosh line. In an Apple developer publication, Apple's CEO Gil Amelio announced the Pippin 1997 Reference Platform, and suggested that the platform would include the latest Macintosh technologies, including IEEE 1394 or <b>FireWire,</b> as well as a 25-pin external SCSI port as standard interfaces. In May 1997, Bandai announced a docking station that would include Ethernet support at US$139.00, although such a peripheral was never made available.|$|E
25|$|The 6 audio {{channels}} can be decrypted {{and then}} re-encrypted into an HDMI or IEEE-1394 (<b>FireWire)</b> signal {{and sent to}} the amplifier, which will then decrypt the digital signal and then extract the 6 channels of audio. HDMI and IEEE-1394 encryption are different from the DVD-A encryption and were designed as a general standard for a high-quality digital interface. The amplifier has to be equipped with a valid decryption key or it won't play the disk.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Mac Mini {{includes two}} USB 2.0 and one <b>FireWire</b> 400 port. Networking is supported with 10/100 Ethernet and V.92 modem ports, while 802.11b/g and Bluetooth were additional build-to-order options. The modem was later {{omitted from the}} Mac Mini, but an external modem remained an option. External displays are supported via a DVI port. Adaptors are also available for VGA, S-Video, and composite video. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo Mini jack for sound out {{at the back of}} the case.|$|E
25|$|Handles {{plug and}} play and {{supports}} device detection and installation at boot time. It also has the responsibility to stop and start devices on demand—this can happen when a bus (such as USB or IEEE 1394 <b>FireWire)</b> gains a new device and {{needs to have a}} device driver loaded to support it. Its bulk is actually implemented in user mode, in the Plug and Play Service, which handles the often complex tasks of installing the appropriate drivers, notifying services and applications of the arrival of new devices, and displaying GUI to the user.|$|E
25|$|During the Mac's {{early history}} Apple {{generally}} refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own. This trend was largely reversed {{in the late}} 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. <b>FireWire</b> is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 3.0 {{added support}} for {{graphics}} importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF and other file formats, and video output components which served primarily to export movie data via <b>FireWire.</b> Apple also licensed several third-party technologies {{for inclusion in}} QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced video compression, the QDesign Music codec for substantial audio compression, and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video effects which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, {{as part of the}} new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).|$|E
25|$|VLC {{media player}} can play high {{definition}} recordings of D-VHS tapes duplicated {{to a computer}} using CapDVHS.exe. This offers another way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. Using a <b>FireWire</b> connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV. VLC media player can display the playing video as the desktop wallpaper, like Windows DreamScene, by using DirectX, only available on Windows operating systems. VLC media player can create screencasts and record the desktop. On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct Media Object (DMO) framework and can thus make use of some third-party DLLs (Dynamic-link library). On most platforms, VLC can tune into and view DVB-C, DVB-T, and DVB-S channels. On macOS the separate EyeTV plugin is required, on Windows it requires the card's BDA Drivers.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was {{released}} on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256MB and a built-in <b>FireWire</b> port. Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used {{a modified version of}} Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, {{with the exception of the}} Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.|$|E
25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and <b>Firewire</b> (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Jobs {{cancelled}} {{almost all}} of the product lines, and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level desktop computer suitable for consumers. The result was the iMac released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as USB, which would then go on to become an industry standard. The iMac also shipped without a floppy disk drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the optical drive and new technologies such as USB and <b>Firewire</b> for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.|$|E
