40|$|Abstract. To {{assess the}} {{behavior}} of concrete beams partially prestressed with external unbonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons, three specimens prestressed with CFRP tendons and one reference specimen prestressed with external steel tendons were tested to failure under third point loading.

The transition from the elastic to the cracked-elastic stage was caused by the development of cracks {{at the bottom of the}} beam, while the transition from the cracked-elastic to the plastic stage was caused by yielding of the non-prestressed steel. For beams prestressed with external CFRP tendons and that with external steel tendons, the relationships between the stress increment in external tendons and the mid-span deflection of specimens were linear or approximately linear.

An innovating investigation was realized on a motorway viaduct close to Lyon in May 2013 : strain gauges will be positioned on four steel tendons of prestressed right to significant cracks of the box-girder, cracks also instrumented by displacement sensors. Indeed, risks of overstretching in the tendons are expected under road traffic. A first relation will be established between the overstretchings evaluated from the measurements of the gauges and the openings of cracks from the dis-placement sensors. Moreover, measurements of temperature gradients were also carried out to distinguish solicitations from traffic loads and temperature effects. All these measurements are realized from a new Wi-Fi platform called PEGASE developed by IFSTTAR and the society A 3 IP. Finally, a fatigue analysis has been carried out in order to establish the residual lifetime of the bridge. An analysis in robustness will be undertaken. Three approaches are described in this paper. The most realistic approach is the experimented one.

40|$|Abstract: <b>External</b> <b>prestressing</b> is commenly {{used with}} notable {{effectiveness}} to increase and upgrade the flexural capacity of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams and slabs. However, the major practical difficulty associated with <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> is that, {{it must be}} applied to relatively high strength concrete elements {{which may not be}} met in many cases where geometry and properties of concrete and steel reinforcement of existing member can't be modified. Hence the designer has no control on the existing structural elements that need repair. This research is aims to develop and evaluate an innovative strengthening technique for low strength concrete slabs. This method is based on applying a thin layer of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) in the compressive side of RC slabs prior to the application of the <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> tendons. The role of the proposed ECC layer is to avoid the early concrete crushing in compression side, and consequently increase the efficiency of the <b>external</b> <b>prestressing.</b> To investigate the efficiency of the proposed strengthening technique, a total of nine RC slabs cast by low concrete strength (compressive strength = 15 MPa). Application of <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> solely would induce brittle failure by abrupt crushing in concrete at the low strength compressed soffit. For That purpose, two different thicknesses of ECC layer were considered in the first group of the experimental program.

The observation of building collapse by earthquake normally caused by malfunction {{of the building}} columns as bearing elements. The columns were failed {{because they did not}} meet the standard of confining reinforcement. In most cases, external confinement is necessary to strengthen the existing columns of old buildings. This research focused on the methods to strengthen the existing columns. Three types of pre-stressed steel rings were used to confine the concrete cylinders of 10 × 20 cm and 10 × 30 cm. Several concrete strengths of 50 MPa, 70 MPa and 100 MPa were selected for constructing 18 specimens of concrete cylinders. The first type of pre-stressed is with zero pre-stressing force represented passive confinement while the second and third types were given different prestressing forces on the steel ring represented active confinement. Prestressing force on the steel ring will cause radial stress that compress the concrete cylinders. Load test were conducted on concrete cylinders to measure the strength and the relationship of stress strain concrete cylinders which was confined by varied external lateral pre-stressing.

40|$|Cells sense, {{generate}} {{and respond}} to forces in their surroundings through cytoskeletal dynamics. Actin, the most abundant protein found in eukaryotic cells, is organized into various cytoskeletal structures that provide physical support for the cell and play important roles in numerous cellular processes. Assembly of F-actin into higher-order structures is regulated by over 100 actin binding proteins (ABPs). Although extensive measurements to estimate the mechanical properties of ABP/F-actin networks showed that they are nonlinear and viscoelastic, {{a full understanding of}} the origin of such fascinating behaviors is lacking. This thesis presents a multi-scale approach to identify the factors that determine the mechanical properties of F-actin networks from the macroscopic level to the single-molecule level. The mechanical properties of F-actin networks were probed by passive and active methods using optical tweezers. For the passive approach the thermal fluctuations of colloidal spheres are monitored to estimate the frequency-dependent complex shear modulus of an F-actin network. In the active approach, the response of an embedded microsphere to a driving force is tracked to obtain the strain-dependent viscoelasticity. The developed methods were applied to F-actin networks cross-linked with various ABPs such as filamin and a -actinin, with and without gelsolin to control filament length. Microstructures of those networks were also characterized in terms of filament length, mesh size, and degree of bundling. (cont.) Comparison between cross-linked F-actin with two different length scales of actin filament suggested that network connectivity is another critical parameter in determining mechanical properties. To better understand how the cross-linking protein responds to an external force, a single molecule assay was used to measure the rupture force of a complex formed by an ABP filamin linking two actin filaments. Both force-induced unbinding and unfolding of filamin were observed at the critical force of 70 ± 23 pN and 57 ± 19 pN, respectively, although unbinding occurred more frequently. Similar pulling experiments were also performed on cross-linked F-actin networks and an abrupt transition was observed in the force trace indicating network rupture. The critical forces at transitions exhibited a similar loading-rate dependence to that observed for rupture forces in the single molecule measurements. Nonlinear behavior observed in strain-dependent microrheology was found to be irreversible. Combined results of molecular unbinding, network rupture, and irreversible network properties suggest that unbinding rather than unfolding is a dominant mechanism governing the mechanical properties of cross-linked F-actin networks. In addition, the mechanical behavior of F-actin networks subjected to an <b>external</b> <b>prestress</b> was investigated using a shear device. Visualization of sheared F-actin networks showed the structural evolution including mesh deformation, filament alignment, and network rupture. (cont.) Measurement of mechanical properties as a function of external strain demonstrated that some regions exhibited strain-hardening while the others showed strain-softening. Aligned stretching of actin filaments observed at high strain seemed {{to play a role in}} strain-stiffening. By comparing the behaviors of an F-actin network cross-linked with wildtype and mutant FLNa, it was demonstrated how molecular structure of the ABP alters the mechanical behavior of F-actin network. by Hyungsuk Lee.

40|$|Abstract. Friction loss is an {{important}} component of the calculation of prestressing loss for external prestress strengthening technology. Unfortunately, the test data of relevant curvature friction and wobble coefficients is scarce, especially for beams strengthened by <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) tendons. Through the experiment of 12 concrete beams strengthened by <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> CFRP tendons, this study attempts to discuss the friction loss algorithm and the reasonable value of friction coefficient. The test results demonstrated that traditional friction loss algorithm for prestressed steel tendons is also suit to <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> CFRP tendons, but the value of curvature and wobble coefficients should be determined by different types of CFRP tendons and saddle design. What is more, aiming at the domestic production of CFRP tendons and the adopted special saddle design in this paper, the curvature friction coefficient is 0. 263 and the wobble coefficient is 0. 0067 at the deviator.

Five beams, four of them were externally strengthened using Parafil rope, were loaded up to failure to investigate the effect of shear span/depth ratio, <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> force and concrete strength on their shear behavior. Test results showed that the shear span to depth ratio has a significant effect on both the shear strength and failure mode of the strengthened beams and the presence of <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> force increased the ultimate load of the tested beams by about 75 %. Equations proposed by different codes for both the conventional reinforced concrete beams and for ordinary prestressed beams were used to evaluate the obtained experimental results. In general, codes equations showed a high level of conservatism in predicting the shear strength of the beams.

40|$|Many bridges in {{the world}} are {{classified}} as deficient and in need of rehabilitation or replacement. Some of them are deficient because their load-carrying capacity is inadequate for today's increased traffic load. To improve their efficiency and increase their load capacity, several methods can be used, {{one of them is the}} <b>external</b> <b>prestressing.</b> Also, to avoid corrosion problem that faced this type of strengthening, Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) can be used instead of steel tendons. Within the different types of FRP, Parafil rope was established to be well suited for prestressing system, combining the benefits of light-weight, high strength, easy handling and efficient anchorage system. Thirteen prestressed beams,one with internal prestressing steel only, and the rest strengthened externally using Parafil Ropes Type G were tested up to failure under two third point loading. Six factors were studied to investigate their effect on the behaviour of strengthened beams. These factors are the value of the <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> force and its eccentricity, deviator position, previous loading stage before strengthening, concrete strength and (span/depth) ratio. Also, analytical investigations were conducted to propose simple equations could be used in the analysis of this beam type, regarding its deflection and flexural strength with an acceptable accuracy. The study indicated that, <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> using Parafil rope is a very powerful system for strengthening or rehabilitation of prestressed concrete structures. Also, providing <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> force by a moderate amount improves the stiffness, and both cracking and ultimate flexural strength of prestressed concrete beams without significant reduction in ductility even for cracked beams. The modifications made to the methods used to calculate deflection and ultimate moment of bonded prestressed concrete, generalised these methods so, they can be used with beams have different types of prestressing tendons (bonded, internal unbonded, external unbonded or mixture of them).

40|$|Strengthening and/or {{upgrading}} {{of concrete}} structures with bonded steel or FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymers) materials or {{by use of}} external tendons have now been used for some time. <b>External</b> <b>prestressing</b> may {{be defined as a}} prestress introduced by tendons located outside a section of a structural member, only connected to the member through deviators and end-anchorages. The main advantages using this technique are; higher utilization of small sectional areas, ease in inspection of the tendons and in their replacement and low friction losses. This type of prestressing can be applied to both new and existing structures that need to be strengthened due to several reasons such as: changes in use, deficiencies in design or construction phase and structural degradation. External prestressed cables of FRP materials have shown to be an alternative to steel cables. Good durability properties and a first-rate behaviour in creep and relaxation have given very good results so far. Bonding prestressed FRP laminates or sheets to a structures surface has proven to be efficient and gives also a better utilization of the strengthening material. The weak part for both external cables as well as bonded laminates, when using FRP materials, has shown to be anchorage. Often the anchorage has problem to handle the high stresses that would justify the use of FRP materials in prestressing.

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>prestressing</b> {{has been}} applied to both new {{construction}} and retrofitting of existing reinforced and prestressed concrete structures. Continuous beams are preferred to simply supported beams because of economy, fewer movement joints and possible benefits from moment redistribution.

Applying the same design approach for RC to <b>external</b> <b>prestressing</b> may lead to design with a lower safety margin. To better understand the behaviour of continuous prestressed concrete beams with unbonded tendons, an experimental investigation is performed in which nine such specimens are tested to failure.

In this paper, the authors have discussed the efficiency of increasing ultimate flexural strength of PC beams reinforced with external cables. The ultimate flexural strength was calculated on the assumption that the elongation of the cable at the ultimate state is equal to that of the concrete which is in the same location as the cable. The change of external cable eccentricity caused by the deflection of the beam was also taken into account in this analysis...|$|E
