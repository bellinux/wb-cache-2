The active noise control system is used to reduce the air-borne noise radiated via the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> whereas the active vibration control system is used to both reduce the structure-borne noise radiated by the duct wall and to minimise the structural feed-through effect that reduces {{the effectiveness of the}} active noise control system. An elemental model based on structural mobility functions and acoustic impedance functions has been developed to investigate the principal effects and limitations of feed-forward active noise control and decentralised velocity feedback vibration control. The principal simulation results have been contrasted and validated with measurements taken on a laboratory duct set-up, equipped with an active noise control system and a decentralised vibration control system. Both simulations and experimental results show that the air-borne noise radiated from the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> can be significantly attenuated using the feed-forward active noise control. In the presence of structure-borne noise the performance of the active noise control system is impaired by a structure-borne feed-through effect.

40|$|The dynamic flow {{distortion}} generated within convoluted aeroengine intakes {{can affect}} the performance and operability of the engine. There {{is a need for}} {{a better understanding of the}} main flow mechanisms that promote flow distortion at the exit of S-shaped intakes. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the main coherent structures in an S-duct flowfield based on a delayed detached-eddy simulation. The capability of this numerical approach to capture the characteristics of the highly unsteady flowfield is demonstrated against high-resolution, synchronous stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements at the aerodynamic interface plane. The flowfield mechanisms responsible for the main perturbations at the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> are identified. Clockwise and counterclockwise streamwise vortices are alternately generated around the separation region at a frequency of St= 0. 53 St= 0. 53, which promote the swirl switching at the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet.</b> Spanwise vortices are also shed from the separation region at a frequency of St= 1. 06 St= 1. 06 and convect downstream along the separated centerline shear layer.

40|$|Several serious {{problems}} such as material durability and fouling in the High Temperature Heat Exchanger (HTEH) for Externally Fired Micro Gas Turbines (EFMGT) cause the low thermal efficiency. In this study for increasing the thermal efficiency, a duct around a cylindrical fixed bed combustor which burns wood pellets is proposed and two different designs, empty and porous material filled, are investigated. A heat transfer model, based on coupling between radiative and convective modes at the combustor and duct sides is developed to evaluate the important geometrical parameters in the different designs. The predicted results for the empty duct show that although an increase of the combustion length increases the temperature of air at the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet,</b> an increase of the combustor diameter is more effective. In addition, an increase of the duct cross section {{is the most effective}} way and according to the predictions, the pressure drop in this case is still acceptable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental studies {{on a combination}} of active noise control and active vibration control for a ventilation duct. Ventilationsystems radiate noise at the duct outlets and from the duct walls. In many practical applications, ventilation ducts are installed without shielding, although, they may run through corridors and adjacent rooms or halls to be ventilated. Thus both air- and structure-borne disturbances can be a cause of acoustic discomfort for the occupants. In this study the combined active control of air- and structure-borne noise is examined. In the theoretical study a duct segment with circular cross-section has been modelled using an elemental approach with coupled acoustic impedance and structural mobility functions. This model is used to investigate the principle effects and limitations of feed forward control using acoustic sources acting on the duct interior and the effect of feedback control forces acting on the duct walls. The control performance is evaluated in terms of (a) the far field sound power radiated from the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> and (b) the far field sound power radiated from the duct walls. For the experimental studies a laboratory duct set-up is used, which is equipped with loudspeaker, shaker and an axial ventilator as primary sources and a combined active noise and active vibration control system. Results for loudspeaker and shaker primary excitations are in reasonable agreement with the simulations for ideal air and structure borne sources. Experiments with the ventilator source are used to investigate the system limitations in the presence of air flow induced turbulences and structure borne disturbances. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the air borne noise radiated from the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> can be significantly attenuated using feed-forward active noise control. In presence of structure borne noise the performance of the activenoise control is impaired and sound radiation from the duct walls is increased. In this case, if the active noise control is combined with a vibration controlsystem, the control of the sound radiation by the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> is improved and considerable reductions of the sound radiation from the duct wall are achieved...|$|E

The duct was expanded to reduce the radiator losses, and the installation of the duct and radiator was made entirely within the wing to reduce form and interference drag. The tests were made using a two-dimensional flow set-up with a full-span duct and radiator. Section aerodynamic characteristics of the basic airfoil are given and also curves showing the characteristics of the various duct-radiator combinations. An expression for efficiency, the primary criterion of merit of any duct, and the effect of the several design parameters of the duct-radiator arrangement are discussed.

40|$|This thesis details a {{study of}} {{strategies}} used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser {{with a variety of}} secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved {{with the use of a}} distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms- 1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the diffuser outlet assembly was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet.</b> The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill&# 146;s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> and the resulting far field sound pressure levels. This result is then used to calculate the corresponding far field sound intensity and sound power levels.

40|$|Linear {{acoustic}} network {{models are}} commonly used to characterize the acoustic behaviour of flow duct systems. In such a model, each element is represented, independent of the elements up- and downstream, by a so-called acoustic two-port.

Although this characterization approach is limited to low frequencies, below the traversal cut-on frequency of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ducts,</b> it allows making an in-depth analysis of the acoustic transmission properties of a duct system and its components.

This project attempted to alter the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> in a way that reduces the test apparatus height while maintaining the reliability of the ASHRAE Standard 37 testing setup. The investigation was done in two scenarios, the first, which altered the direction of the flow after the unit with an elbow and measured static pressure downstream of the elbow, and the second which inserted a passive resistive piece in the flow to decrease the required distance between the unit and the static pressure measurement. Three air handling units were used in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 testing, with the two smallest units additionally being tested in Scenario 1 with an over-sized duct. The scenario tests were required to be within 5 % power and 2. 5 % airflow of a baseline test following ASHRAE Standard 37. he results for Scenario 1 have shown that ASHRAE Standard 37 can be modified to reduce testing height restrictions by using a square elbow with turning vanes, provided it is oriented in a specific way in relation to the blower.

The tone is characterised by a frequency above the first mode cut-on frequency of the exhaust duct and it is not steady in either amplitude or frequency. Passive silencing of the exhaust is a very expensive and inconvenient option and for this reason the feasibility of using active noise control was investigated. Zander and Hansen developed a theoretical model for analysing the effect of active noise control on higher order rectangular duct modes,and used it to evaluate the effects of source size,location and strength. It was shown that the total acoustic power reduction was dependent on the relative locations of the control sources. More recently this work was applied to the practical example of a cylindrical spray dryer exhaust stack to determine the most suitable location and number of control sources and error sensors. Prior to installation in the exhaust stack a half scale model was constructed to test the theory.

A computer program has been developed for the successive calculation of the temperature variation of the void air from the inlet to outlet {{in the direction of}} void air flow. The program utilizes the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) to compute transient heat conduction and temperature distribution of the cross section of the void slab. Using this computer prigram, the temperature variation of the void air for nine types of void slabs: uninsulated, upside of the slab insulated, the surface of the voids insulated, both upside of the slab and the surface of the voids insulated are all simulated under actual air-conditioning conditions for a commercial building.

40|$|The {{problem of}} steady, laminar, {{incompressible}} flow through curved ducts of varying cross-sectional area is investigated numerically. The area change is attained {{by keeping the}} upper and lower walls at a constant angle of inclination with respect to the horizontal. Since the angle of divergence or convergence used is small and the Reynolds numbers employed are high, the governing equations are simplified by applying the parabolic assumptions. In most of the previous studies, a Neumann boundary value problem in the correction potential is solved to estimate the velocity corrections which are used to enforce continuity satisfaction in the cross stream plane. In the present study, a simple technique is developed to calculate these velocity corrections. It is achieved by solving two mixed boundary value problems in the velocity correction. The finite difference form of the momentum equations are solved using an alternating direction implicit method. The velocity correction equations and the Poisson equation for pressure are solved using the successive line over relaxation scheme and the strongly implicit procedure respectively. Results are obtained for flows with uniform axial velocity at the inlet with the Dean number ranging from 50 to 300. The ratio of the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> to the inlet area varied from 0. 8 to 6. 0 in the current study. The procedure to calculate the velocity corrections is shown to be correctly formulated and that it provides accurate results. The variation of the centerline velocity with the streamwise distance shows that the effect of area change is realized only beyond a certain axial distance and that the variation is linear in this region. The axial presssure drop as well as centerline velocity variation indicate that the location of axial flow separation moves closer to the inlet when the Dean number increases. The secondary flow is suppressed or enhanced depending on the divergence or convergence of the cross-sectional area respectively. The area change has a non-uniform effect on the secondary flow, in the case of diverging ducts. The area change has a definite effect on the secondary flow separation also.

40|$|Packed beds {{have many}} {{industrial}} applications and are increasingly {{used in the}} process industries due to their low pressure drop. With the introduction of more efficient packings, novel packing materials (i. e. adsorbents) and new applications (i. e. flue gas desulphurisation); the aspect ratio (height to diameter) of such beds is decreasing. Obtaining uniform gas distribution in such beds is of crucial importance in minimising operating costs and optimising plant performance. Since to some extent a packed bed acts as its own distributor the importance of obtaining uniform gas distribution has increased as aspect ratios (bed height to diameter) decrease. There is no rigorous design method for distributors due to a limited understanding of the fluid flow phenomena and in particular {{of the effect of}} the bed base / free fluid interface. This study is based on a combined theoretical and modelling approach. The starting point is the Ergun Equation which is used to determine the pressure drop over a bed where the flow is uni-directional. This equation has been applied in a vectorial form so it can be applied to maldistributed and multi-directional flows and has been realised in the Computational Fluid Dynamics code PHOENICS. The use of this equation and its application has been verified by modelling experimental measurements of maldistributed gas flows, where there is no free fluid / bed base interface. A novel, two-dimensional experiment has been designed to investigate the fluid mechanics of maldistributed gas flows in shallow packed beds. The flow through the outlet of the duct below the bed can be controlled, permitting a rigorous investigation. The results from this apparatus provide useful insights into the fluid mechanics of flow in and around a shallow packed bed and show the critical effect of the bed base. The PHOENICS/vectorial Ergun Equation model has been adapted to model this situation. The model has been improved by the inclusion of spatial voidage variations in the bed and the prescription of a novel bed base boundary condition. This boundary condition is based on the logarithmic law for velocities near walls without restricting the velocity at the bed base to zero and is applied within a turbulence model. The flow in a curved bed section, which is three-dimensional in nature, is examined experimentally. The effect of the walls and the changes in gas direction on the gas flow are shown to be particularly significant. As before, the relative amounts of gas flowing through the bed and <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> can be controlled. The model and improved understanding of the underlying physical phenomena form the basis for the development of new distributors and rigorous design methods for them...|$|E
40|$|In {{many kinds}} of buildings, the {{ventilation}} is handled by a mechanical ventilation system. Such ventilation systems constitute a well known source of broadband noise. As awareness of the negative effects that subjection to low frequency noise can have on human well-being has increased, so too has the requirement for quieter ventilation installations. Traditionally, duct born noise is attenuated using passive resistive silencers. These passive silencers are valued {{for their ability to}} produce a high level of attenuation over a broad frequency range, however they tend to become large and bulky if designed for low frequency attenuation. The active noise control (ANC) technique is known for its ability to produce high levels of attenuation in the low frequency range even with a relatively moderate sized ANC system. On the other hand, ANC normally tends to be ineffective for higher frequencies. Accordingly, a combination of active- and passive techniques, i. e. the construction of a hybrid active/passive silencer, provides a duct silencer solution of manageable size which also covers the low frequency range. The ANC systems controller normally relies on adaptive digital signal processing. Even so, adequate levels of attenuation {{are not likely to be}} obtained if the installation of the ANC system is not designed to account for the physical factors that may degrade its performance. This thesis focuses on applying ANC in ventilation systems, with particular emphasis on analysis and installation design, for the purpose of reducing the influence of some of these degrading physical factors. The degrading factors which are of particular interest include: flow induced noise in the microphone signals, acoustic feedback between the control loudspeaker and reference microphone, and standing waves inside the ducts. With respect to installation design, focus is also placed upon industry requests on the ANC system. Taking this into consideration has led to a module based approach, in which the microphones and the loudspeaker are installed in separate modules based on standard duct parts. This thesis comprises four parts. The first describes initial investigations of potential microphone installations intended to reduce flow induced noise. The second part analyzes the influence of flow induced noise on the digital controller and presents further investigations of microphone modules. Further, results of measurements conducted in an acoustic laboratory according to an ISO-standard are presented. The attenuation produced by the ANC system was approximately 15 - 25 dB between 50 - 315 Hz even for airflow speeds up to 20 m/s. The third part of this thesis focuses on the possibility of using the passive silencer with which the ANC system is combined, to reduce acoustic feedback and standing waves. The fourth and final part investigates the possibility of using a passive silencer to reduce standing waves in the duct when the ANC system is not installed near the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet...</b>|$|E
40|$|Total {{pressure}} drop in the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ducting</b> of the LCA-ECS primary heat exchanger were determined corresponding to flight Mach numbers upto 0. 86. A suitable screen/wire mesh was selected whose pressure loss characteristics matched {{with those of the}} primary heat exchanger being procured for use with LCA. The flow through the duct at low inlet Mach numbers was augmented using a suitable ejector. The inlet duct pressure loss was found to be nearly 60...|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Minnesota Power, Inc., the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) sampled for lead at the stack (or duct {{directly}} leading to the stack) for three units at the Boswell Energy Center. All sampling was done in triplicate using U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 12, with sampling procedures following EPA Methods 1 through 4. During the test program, lead sampling was done using EPA Method 12 in the <b>duct</b> at the <b>outlet</b> of the baghouse serving Unit 2 and the <b>duct</b> at the <b>outlet</b> of the wet particulate scrubber serving Unit 3. For Unit 4, lead sampling was done at the stack. The specific objective for the project was to determine the concentration of lead in the flue gas being emitted into the atmosphere from the Boswell Energy Center. The test program was performed during the period of May 8 through 11, 2000. This report presents the test data, sample calculations, and results, and a discussion of the lead sampling performed at the Boswell Energy Center. The detailed test data and test results, raw test data, process data, laboratory reports, and equipment calibration records are provided in Appendices A, B, and C...|$|R
40|$|The noise {{sources and}} {{mechanisms}} {{of the front}} and rear HV AC systems of an automotive are characterized experimentally. The front system has three main <b>outlet</b> <b>ducts</b> equipped with louvers and operates in two modes of bypass and recirculation. The inlet and outlet sides of the rear system are both located in the cabin; hence, it always works only on the recirculation mode. The <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> of the rear system is covered by a ten-hole curved plate which is found to be a strong source of noise. Both systems are tested at the highest possible flow rate, as it is the most annoying condition of noise generation. The noise coming out of each duct of {{the front and rear}} systems and their fan units are measured separately. Since the fan {{is an important part of}} the systems, it is studied at different speeds with more details. In order to compare the effect of the noise generated by the fan section with the noise produced by the complete system, the impeller is replaced with a speaker generating an overall sound level similar to the fan noise. Under this condition, the flow noise due to the evaporator core, distributive ducts and louvers are cancelled. It is concluded that at low frequencies the duct flow-noise i...|$|R
