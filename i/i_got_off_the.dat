500|$|In 2017, Durant became {{involved}} with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement. On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, [...] "I'm so excited because I got off social media. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube." [...] As of April 26, 2017, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 100,000 subscribers and one million video views.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1993 {{release of}} her third album, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, McLachlan spent {{two and a}} half years touring. This long period on the road {{finished}} in January 1996; she was due to begin work on her fourth album in April of that year, but was mentally exhausted. She later said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road, I thought Fumbling was my swan song, [...] I'd never make another record ever again. I couldn't imagine writing another song in my life. I had a huge psychological block for a long time." [...] She spent time working in the studio in Quebec but struggled to produce anything for her new album. At her manager's suggestion, she returned home to Vancouver and took six months off. She said that after this break—and some time spent in therapy—she began to feel more in control of her creativity and started writing material for the album.|$|E
2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station to meet me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the end the}} {{evidence}} against me was held to be insufficient to justify a conviction, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> on <b>the</b> minor charge of drunk and disorderly. But I lost my situation and I lost my young lady, and I don't care if I never see a goose again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently, however, Kaptein {{began to}} get restless. First he snorted, then {{he got up and}} snorted again. I could not make it out, so like a fool <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>off</b> <b>the</b> waggon-box to have a look round, {{thinking}} it might be the lost oxen coming.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Our organ is tuning up its pipes--man comes to-morrow--Prayers in the Lady Chapel and not choral, and it's {{a holiday}} at school, so <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> by <b>the</b> 5.20, and need {{not go back}} till the 6.10 to-morrow. We are practising our throats out to lead you all on the 3rd. You know yon are coming, the whole kit of you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
60|$|I was on {{the ground}} and down on one knee in such a hurry, that to this day I know not by what process <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> horse.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I {{stopped the}} machine, and saw about me again the old {{familiar}} laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> thing very shakily, {{and sat down}} upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, {{and the whole thing}} have been a dream.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Shelter was {{the first}} {{promoter}} to bring punk and hardcore to the Cameo. According to Shelter, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road with Pickett and started doing bigger shows at the Cameo, the financing came from Patrick, the owner of Tobacco Road, whom I had worked for part time as a waiter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About two miles," [...] {{came from}} Jack Wumble. [...] "I reckon <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a bit <b>off</b> <b>the</b> trail yesterday, but I know I am right now, boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bank drafts for two millions," [...] was his summing up, [...] "and a {{thousand}} a day piling {{up from my}} claims. And now I want some beef stew and canned peaches. <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train since <b>I</b> mushed out of Seattle, and I'm hungry. The stuff the niggers feed you on Pullmans don't count. You gentlemen order what you want." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{and in my}} dreams, often, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> little narrow-gauge train {{where the}} straggly village stood beside the big dry creek, {{and got into the}} buckboard behind my {{mountain}} horses, and drove hour by hour past all the old familiar landmarks of my alfalfa meadows, and on to my upland pastures where my rotated crops of corn and barley and clover were ripe for harvesting and where I watched my men engaged in the harvest, while beyond, ever climbing, my goats browsed the higher slopes of brush into cleared, tilled fields.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] Cyril {{replied with}} a {{careless}} laugh. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train at the settlement, everybody stared at me, and there were anxious inquiries as to where I'd been. I promised {{to tell them about}} it another time, and at the livery-stable Kevan said something about my being killed. I told him it didn't look like it; and as the boys seemed determined on hearing my adventures; I rode off smartly. When I reached your place, Svendsen looked scared, and all I could get out of him was that you were here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{horror of}} this great {{darkness}} came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared {{the edge of the}} sun. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, {{the size of a football}} perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> watch by {{this time}} {{and laid it on}} the table, unobserved, as I thought. Alberta, not having the key of the bracelet, {{had not been able to}} get it off, and she sat there crimson with shame. As for Uncle William, there was {{positively}} a twinkle in his eye. He did not look in the least ogreish.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he replied, despondently. [...] "Awhile back <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my mind <b>off</b> <b>the</b> game. Then--people who don't like me {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of my slump to----" ...|$|R
5000|$|During a {{performance}} at the Hippodrome, London in 1948, after her return to Britain, the Duke of Edinburgh was introduced to Kirkwood in her dressing room. Later that evening, they went to dinner at Les Ambassadeurs restaurant in Mayfair. Kirkwood reported later: [...] "He {{was so full of}} life and energy. I suspect he felt trapped and rarely got a chance to be himself. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> on <b>the</b> right foot because I made him laugh". Reporters recalled that the pair danced and had breakfast the next day together.|$|R
60|$|Alicia, by my advice, engaged {{a modest}} lodging {{in a suburb}} of Barkingham. In the days of the red-brick house, she had seldom been seen in the town, and she was not at all known by sight in the suburb. We {{arranged}} that she was to visit me as often as the authorities would let her. She had no companion, and wanted none. Mrs. Baggs, who had never forgiven the rebuke administered to her at the starting-point of our journey, left us at the close of it. Her leave-taking was dignified and pathetic. She kindly informed Alicia that she wished her well, though she could not conscientiously look upon her as a lawful married woman; and she begged me (in case <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off),</b> <b>the</b> next time I met with a respectable person who was kind to me, to profit by remembering my past errors, and to treat my next benefactress with more confidence than I had treated her.|$|E
5000|$|As the bus drew up {{in front}} of the house, I saw a young boy playing in the yard. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bus and went over to him. [...] "How long have you lived in this house?" [...] I asked. [...] "I was born here," [...] he replied. [...] "Me too," [...] I said ...|$|E
5000|$|Around 24 October an unclear {{and vague}} unrest caught hold of me. ... On Monday 28 October <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train ... I {{made my way}} to the {{editorial}} office of the Nat. Listy, where I met Štefánek. ... 'We have been waiting for you for three days.' ... In front of the Obecny dom hall there was a huge crowd. ... Through the whole night and the following days we put down the institutional requirements of the state.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{confirmed}} by Delgado, that an audio clip from a remix called [...] "Los terroristas", with the line [...] "Con Los Terroristas" [...] was used uncredited in the opening of Baauer's [...] "Harlem Shake", which became a viral internet sensation in February 2013. Baauer had referred to the voice in the opening of his song, as [...] "The dude in <b>the</b> beginning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> somewhere <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Internet, <b>I</b> don’t even know where" [...] in an earlier interview. Delgado told WAPA-TV’s “Lo sé todo” that {{he was working with}} his lawyers and that he plans to meet with them next week to discuss next steps.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 30. The third caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 36 for a single-car incident in turn 1. Rounding the front stretch, Harvick's left-rear tire went down and he dove down onto the apron. After the race, crew chief Rodney Childers said that the car [...] "had that left-rear go down and automatically you panic and think it was self-inflicted like maybe we didn’t have enough air in it, that kind of thing. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>off</b> <b>the</b> (pit) box, I saw a piece cut right in the tread. It was probably {{out of one of}} the cars that was tore up earlier." ...|$|R
60|$|Recollection of the {{subsequent}} proceedings is not, so far as I am concerned, amusing. By a miracle of good luck--they say Providence watches over certain of us--the incident happened in Carlsruhe, where I possess a German friend, an official of some importance. Upon {{what would have been}} my fate had the station not been at Carlsruhe, or had my friend been from home, I do not care to dwell; as it was <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> as <b>the</b> saying is, by the skin of my teeth. I should like to add that I left Carlsruhe without a stain upon my character, but that would not be the truth. My going scot free is regarded in police circles there to this day as a grave miscarriage of justice.|$|R
5000|$|Candi Staton {{was unaware}} of the record's {{existence}} until she was told that she had a number 1 single: [...] "They were calling my house saying I had a number one record in England, and I said, 'What song? I haven't released any song.' When they told me it was [...] "You Got the Love", I said I'd never made a record called that. Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> phone and realised - it was the one from the diet video! Which was never supposed to be put on a record at all".|$|E
5000|$|Carpenter {{announced}} the tour on April 26, 2017, {{while she was}} touring with her first ever headline tour, the Evolution Tour. Referring to the tour, the singer said: [...] "Ever since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road from my first tour, all I can think about is going back out. Now this time, everything is gonna be bigger, better and very, very unexpected". New Hope Club and Alex Aiono were announced as supporting acts. Carpenter released her song [...] "Why" [...] on July 7, 2017, following {{the beginning of the}} tour.|$|E

5000|$|About Miracle, DeVille told Sounds magazine, [...] "This is {{the first}} album where I had left-overs. The doggy bag! <b>I</b> <b>got</b> good stuff on the record. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> good stuff <b>off</b> <b>the</b> record — 22 songs! I wrote and I wrote...it was a cakewalk. It was so easy. Of course we had some problems. It was so powerful, nothing could get in the way. We worked on the album {{for four or five}} months." ...|$|R
60|$|Just as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{my knees}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> spatient's breast, Maud peeped {{in at the}} door. She had {{remained}} in the lane till she thought the charm had had time to hibernate, then came in to have her laugh. She began having it, gently; but seeing me with the empty bottle in my sable hand, and the murky inspiration rolling off my face in gasconades, she got graver, and came in very soberly.|$|R
5000|$|Freberg was {{employed}} as a voice actor in animation shortly after graduating from Alhambra High School. He began at Warner Brothers in 1944 by getting on a bus and asking the driver to let him off [...] "in Hollywood". As he describes in his autobiography, It Only Hurts When <b>I</b> Laugh, he <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bus and found {{a sign that said}} [...] "talent agency". He walked in, and the agents there arranged for him to audition for Warner Brothers cartoons where he was promptly hired.|$|R
5000|$|Navasky {{later wrote}} (on p. 298) {{in his book}} A Matter of Opinion about being confronted by Kissinger, [...] "'Tell me, Mr. Navasky,' Kissinger said in his famous {{guttural}} tones, 'how is it that a short article in a obscure journal such as yours about a conversation {{that was supposed to}} have taken place years ago about something that did or didn't happen in Argentina resulted in sixty people holding placards denouncing me a few months ago at the airport when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane in Copenhagen?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{her maiden}} speech, {{she talked about}} her {{commitment}} to social justice, equal opportunity for women and her Roman Catholic faith. She also made light of an incident that happened during the 1999 state election. She was working in John Watkins' campaign office when she took a call from Premier Bob Carr's communications director, Walt Secord. Keneally later learned that Secord had demanded that Dawkins' campaign team [...] "get that woman with an American accent off the telephones." [...] She replied, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> phones that day, but today I have the floor." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{inspiration for}} the song came to co-songwriter Jay Graydon in the bathroom. He explained to Songfacts: [...] "'Turn Your Love Around' was a gift, and it's the gift that keeps giving. I {{was in the bathroom}} when I came up with the melody, and I was sitting down, if you get my drift. Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> can as fast as I could and got to a cassette machine so I wouldn't forget it. George Benson was coming in town Tuesday, so I had four days {{to come up with a}} song for The George Benson Collection. And I was gettin' nothing. And then bang! I just came up with this melody for the chorus when I was in the bathroom." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} season of Everybody Loves Raymond ended in 1997, the series' creator, Philip Rosenthal, asked Ray Romano {{what he was going}} to do over the summer. When Rosenthal {{suggested}} he go to Italy, Romano did not accept because he was [...] "not really interested in other cultures." [...] According to Rosenthal, [...] "After <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> floor, <b>I</b> realized: Here's an episode." [...] Directed by Gary Halvorson, [...] "Italy" [...] guest stars Silvana De Santis as Colletta, Pierrino Mascarino as Giorgio, Alex Meneses as Stefania, David Proval as Signore Fogagnolo, Enzo Vitagliano as the Bocce player, Sergio Sivori, Vanni Bramat, Luca Francucci and Alessandro Francucci. It was filmed in July 2000 in the town Anguillara Sabazia outside of Rome. Romano first hinted of the episode in an interview published that same month in the Rome News-Tribune.|$|R
60|$|I myself {{liked the}} hero of the tale more than I have liked worthier men, perhaps because I thought I had {{achieved}} in him a true rustic New England type in contact with urban life under entirely modern conditions. What seemed to me my esthetic success in him possibly softened me to his ethical shortcomings; but I do not expect others to share my weakness for Jeff Durgin, whose strong, rough surname had been waiting for his personality ever since <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> side of an ice-cart many years before.|$|R

'I come on the train,' he says, 'by myself. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> here because <b>the</b> conductor said my ticket had ex-pirated.' He looks at John Tom with sudden suspicion 'I bet you ain't a Indian,' he says. 'You don't talk like a Indian. You look like one, but all a Indian can say is [...] "heap good" [...] and [...] "paleface die." [...] Say, I bet you are one of them make-believe Indians that sell medicine on the streets. I saw one once in Quincy.' ...|$|R
