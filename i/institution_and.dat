40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze and clarify the process of {{formation}} and change in the <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs of international airfreight. I categorize the <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs for moving goods, money and documents into functional <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs. Rights and obligations flow together with merchandise, foreign exchanges and documents. There are <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs to govern these flows which are known as the coordinating <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs. Formation of <b>and</b> changes to <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs begin from functional ones. A coordinating institution or custom adjusts to the formation of or change in a functional institution or custom. This formation or change causes chain reactions but does not necessarily continue until the system becomes perfect. Some coordinating <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs tend to remain half-finished. This phenomenon is called “incompleteness of coordinating <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> customs. ” Problems with a coordinating institution or custom tend to be left untouched when the only means of settlement is to revise a functional institution or custom...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the partial effects of <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> human capital on growth. We find that cross-country regressions of the log-level of per capita GDP on instrumented measures of <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> schooling are uninformative {{about the relative}} importance of <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> human capital in the long run because of multicollinearity problems. Using dynamic panel regressions we show that both <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> human capital have significant effects on growth. Using Rodrik's (2005) four-way partition of institutions, we also unbundle institutions. We show that strong market creating <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> market stabilising <b>institutions</b> are growth enhancing.

40|$|Optimal growth {{requires}} pro-growth <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> culture. In {{an optimal}} growth pattern, <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> culture facilitate entrepreneurship and innovation. In contrast, if the development <b>and</b> coevolution of <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> culture are distorted, growth can become permanently stagnant, with a distorted creative destruction process causing weak entrepreneurship and innovation activity. Policymakers should therefore plan and implement pro-growth structural changes to <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> culture {{that account for}} their coevolution process. Otherwise, imported growth (i. e., incoming capital flows or innovation) must be relied upon to form an exogenous pro-growth prototype that promotes growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation...|$|R
