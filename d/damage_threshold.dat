Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field.

40|$|The working {{package of}} this project {{was focused on the}} {{production}} of low loss dielectric coatings for the UV/VUV-spectral range. Besides conventional boat evaporation, ion-assisted deposition and ion beam sputtering were employed. These ion techniques have the advantage of being able to produce films at low substrate temperatures with low scatter losses. With conventional thermal evaporation, mirrors based on fluorides for excimer-laser-applications could be produced with low absorption losses and high laser-induced <b>damage</b> <b>thresholds.</b> High substrate temperatures of more than 400 C are required. With the ion techniques, coatings with low scatter losses, high packing density and high environmental stability could be achieved at substrate temperatures of less than 100 C. On the other hand IAD- and IBS-mirrors show high absorption losses and low <b>damage</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the UV/VUV-range. Nevertheless, the mirrors with the highest reflectivity are IBS-coatings based on oxides, due to their low scatter losses. At longer wavelengths, the advantages of the ion techniques are more pronounced. Mirrors for the wavelength of 514 nm could be produced with the IBS-process with total losses of less than 10 ppm. Furthermore, IBS-mirrors for the NdYAG-laser show <b>damage</b> <b>thresholds</b> comparable with the best conventional systems. (orig.)
