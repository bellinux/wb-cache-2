For the variable coefficient combined KdV equation (1) with a forced term, the constructing of conservation laws is not easy because of the arbitrariness of the variable coefficients a(t), b(t), m(t), and the forced term R(t).

40|$|Abstract – We {{present a}} {{methodology}} for proving termination of left-linear term rewriting systems (TRSs) by using Albert Burroni’s polygraphs, {{a kind of}} rewriting systems on algebraic circuits. We translate the considered TRS into a polygraph of minimal size whose termination is proven with a polygraphic interpretation, then we get back the property on the TRS. We recall Yves Lafont’s general translation of TRSs into polygraphs and known links between their termination properties. We give several conditions on the original TRS, including being a first-order functional program, that <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{reduce the size of}} the polygraphic translation. We also prove sufficient conditions on the polygraphic interpretations of a minimal translation to imply termination of the original TRS.

The constrained operator has a reduced number of independent coefficients, leading to improved migration efficiency, whilst retaining accuracy and flexibility for different maximum propagation angles and grid intervals in the inline and crossline directions. Our optimization process for the operator design <b>ensures</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> quickly design {{a large number of}} well-behaved operators, for different combinations of velocity and anisotropy parameters.

Current methods for motion capture often suffer from occlusions, which limits the accuracy of their pose estimation.

Different from previous monocular depth camera systems, we leverage two Kinect sensors to acquire more information about human movements, which <b>ensures</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> still get an accurate estimation even when significant occlusion occurs. Because human motion is temporally constant, we adopt a learning analysis to mine the temporal information across the posture variations.

However, many of these applications require some level of motion detection, if only to notice the cases when a network ceases to be statically located and starts to have moving nodes. As most of the currently used application scenarios rely {{on the assumption that}} motion will not happen, if a node does move it will cause significant amounts of damage to any protocols relying on this static assumption e. g. routing, localisation, aggregation, etc. In this paper we look at methods for detecting moving nodes, using only RSSI data, including an anchor-less solution to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> always detect motion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{development}} of high-level standard representations of buildings has been welcomed {{by the majority}} within the industry. Such standards allow for semantic interoperability between {{the large number of}} design tools which are available to practitioners in the A/E/C and FM industries. However, with such standards comes greater reliance on the information contained within the models which are transmitted, and interpreted, automatically between design tools. Unlike geometry-based standards (e. g., DXF, IGES, DWG, etc) where there was always an expectation of human interpretation, this semantic data must be correct to fit within the interoperable world we have developed. Testing of the semantic interoperability of a small number of commercial design tools has shown that this level of trust is not yet able to be assumed and that further work {{needs to be done to}} <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> preserve meaning when moving semantic information between design tools. ...|$|E
