5|$|Hooper {{finished}} school aged 16, then {{wrote the}} script for his first professional short film, entitled Painted Faces. He {{spent the next two}} years raising capital for the short by courting advertisement directors, whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by Hooper. Director Paul Weiland invested in the short, which provided Hooper with the equipment he needed. After two years of financing and production, Painted Faces was completed. Hooper wrote, produced, directed and edited it. It was sold to Channel 4 and broadcast on the channel's <b>First</b> <b>Frame</b> strand in 1992, had a screening at the 35th London Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} session, Maguire took the <b>first</b> <b>frame,</b> but Higgins won the next three, compiling a 100 {{break in the}} third. Breaks of 72, 55, and 76 allowed Maguire to regain the lead, before Higgins took the eighth after Maguire missed a straightforward red to leave it 4–4 {{at the end of}} the first session. In the evening session, Higgins took the ninth, before Maguire made two breaks over 50 in the 10th. Higgins then made two consecutive century breaks, including a 144 in the 11th, which equalled his own highest break. He continued his run with a break of 68 in the 13th, before Maguire pulled one back in the next. A 97 break gave Higgins the victory.|$|E
5|$|In the Masters, O'Sullivan {{reached the}} final by beating Joe Perry, Ali Carter and Stephen Maguire. In a tense final against {{defending}} champion Mark Selby, neither player {{was able to}} obtain a sizeable lead, with frames littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3–1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4–4, and took the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7–5. O'Sullivan responded by taking three frames in succession himself, to lead 8–7. The following two frames were shared, and at 9–8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10–8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with a cue that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive frames. In {{the first round of}} the 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10–5 win against Stuart Bingham. O'Sullivan compiled a 140 break in the second, a 104 in the eighth, and a 103 in the 14th. He was defeated in the second round 11–13, by Mark Allen, after having led 9–7.|$|E

25|$|While {{some aspects}} of the film the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> with Riggan, for {{instance}} went unchanged from Birdman's conception to release, others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself.|$|E
25|$|Shenandoah was {{powered by}} , eight-cylinder Packard {{gasoline}} engines. Six engines were originally installed, but in 1924 one engine (aft {{of the control}} car) was removed. The <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> of Shenandoah was erected by 24 June 1922; on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated free of the ground. Helium cost $55 per thousand cubic feet at the time, and was considered too expensive to simply vent to the atmosphere {{to compensate for the}} weight of fuel consumed by the gasoline engines. Neutral buoyancy was preserved by installing condensers to capture the water vapor in the engine exhaust.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an {{extension}} to the PNG format called APNG was proposed as {{alternative to the}} MNG format by Mozilla. APNG provide the ability to animate PNG files, while retaining backwards compatibility in decoders that cannot understand the animation chunk (unlike MNG). Older decoders will simply render the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> of the animation. The PNG group officially rejected APNG as an official extension on April 20, 2007. There have been several subsequent proposals for a simple animated graphics format based on PNG using several different approaches. Nevertheless, Animated Portable Network Graphics is still under development by Mozilla and is supported in Firefox 3 while MNG support was dropped.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} session of the final O'Sullivan won the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> with a break of 86. The next two frames were shared, before O'Sullivan made a century, which he {{followed}} with a 72 in the frame after. The sixth frame had lasted 36 minutes, when O’Sullivan stroked in the pink to a distant balk pocket before clipping in a tricky black for 5–1 lead. McCulloch won the next to bring the score to 5–2 in O'Sullivan's favour {{at the end of}} {{the first session}}. In the second session O'Sullivan took the first two with breaks of 66 and 104. O'Sullivan won two of the next three to bring the score to 8–4, before missing a relatively straightforward pot in the 13th, which allowed McCulloch to take the frame. A break of 71 in the next gave O'Sullivan the victory.|$|E
25|$|Davis, who {{had been}} ranked the world number one for two years, and would remain in that {{position}} for another five, was strong favourite going into the event. The pair met in the semi-finals twelve months before with Davis coming through a convincing winner by 16 frames to 9. Taylor started the final strongly with a fifty plus break but Davis proved too strong by whitewashing Taylor in the first session and won the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> of the second session to lead 8–0, Taylor won the ninth frame on the pink after Davis attempted and missed a fine cut on the green. This frame {{appeared to be the}} turning point of the match. Davis, looking tired and jaded allowed Taylor to win six of the next seven frames, producing quality break building including the highest break of the final of 98 to trail only 7–9 overnight.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the <b>first</b> <b>frame,</b> it was usually black).|$|E

25|$|In 1831 {{the federal}} {{survey of the}} Northwest Territory reached the Grand River; it set the {{boundaries}} for Kent County, named after prominent New York jurist James Kent. In 1833, a land office was established in White Pigeon, Michigan, with Campau and fellow settler Luther Lincoln seeking land in the Grand River valley. Lincoln purchased land {{in what is now}} known as Grandville, while Campau became perhaps the most important settler when he bought 72 acres (291,000 m²) from the federal government for $90 and named his tract Grand Rapids. Over time, it developed as today's main downtown business district. In the spring of 1833, Campau sold Joel Guild, who traveled from New York, a plot of land for $25.00, with Guild building the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> structure in Grand Rapids, which is now where McKay Tower stands. Guild later became the postmaster, with mail at the time being delivered monthly from the Gull Lake, Michigan to Grand Rapids. Grand Rapids in 1833 was only a few acres of land cleared {{on each side of the}} Grand River, with oak trees planted in light, sandy soil standing between what is now Lyon Street and Fulton Street.|$|E
25|$|Ding {{could not}} get past the second round {{in any of the}} first six ranking events of the 2012/2013 season to find himself ranked world number 11 in December. However, he won the minor-ranking Scottish Open by {{defeating}} Anthony McGill in the final. This signalled an improvement in form for Ding as at the Welsh Open he beat Mark King, Mark Allen and Robert Milkins to reach the semi-finals, where he was edged out 5–6 by Stuart Bingham. At the World Open he was whitewashed 0–5 by John Higgins in the quarter-finals. His title at the Scottish Open formed part of the Players Tour Championship events with Ding finishing sixth on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals. At the Finals he made the fifth 147 of his career in the <b>first</b> <b>frame</b> of his quarter-final against Allen and made two further century breaks in a 4–3 win. He cruised past Kurt Maflin 4–0 in the semi-finals before staging a remarkable comeback from 0–3 down in the final against Neil Robertson to take his sixth ranking title with a 4–3 win. Ding made eight century breaks in the 20 frames he won during the tournament, with no other player compiling more than one. However, his poor form in tournaments played in his homeland continued as he was beaten 3–5 by Barry Hawkins {{in the first round of}} the China Open. Ding beat veteran Alan McManus 10–5 in the first round of the World Championship and came back from 2–6 down after the first session against Mark King in the second round to lead 9–7 after the next session and went on to win 13–9. Ding came up against Barry Hawkins in the quarter-finals and struggled for consistency throughout the match, losing 7–13. His end of season ranking was world number 10.|$|E
