40|$|Bank {{insolvency}} regimes vary widely. First, {{many countries}} maintain separate bank insolvency rules {{from those that}} govern insolvency of other firms or individuals. Other countries have no special regime and rely on their <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> law for bank closure. Second, some countries rely on an administrative process for bank closure in which the bank supervisor, bank insurer, or other agency {{has the power to}} appoint the conservator or receiver, and, in some instances, may appoint itself to the job. Other countries rely on a judicial process in which the bank supervisor (or bank managers or creditors) must apply to the court for the appointment of a conservator or receiver. A comparison of the United States and United Kingdom bank insolvency regimes reflects many of the different approaches used throughout the world. The U. K. system relies on <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> law for the closure of banks. The system is judicial in that a court decides whether a bank is insolvent and insolvency is the only basis for closing the bank. In contrast, the U.

40|$|Self-insurance {{is often}} {{permitted}} {{as a means}} of satisfying regulatory requirements imposed on operators to evidence capability to bear their environmental liabilities. Its hallmark is that operators or their parent companies prove their financial strength rather than dedicate specific assets/funds to cover these costs. This article examines whether self-insurance can ensure that adequate funds are available when required. It is argued that if a self-insuring operator and/or its parent enter into liquidation then the protection afforded to their creditors under insolvency law may result in an environmental regulator recovering little or, indeed, nothing in respect of the costs associated with any requisite preventive, remedial or restorative works. This protection includes a liquidator’s ability to disclaim ‘onerous property’ and challenge certain payments made to the regulator as a voidable ‘preference’.

Insolvency presents a unique opportunity to study fields since it is at this point when there is a shortfall of funds that the field's power relations become most clear and the struggles on the field more visible. In order to provide a more nuanced complex picture of the football field, its actors and regulations, especially those relating to insolvency, this paper draws upon the work of Pierre Bourdieu.

30|$|The Spanish {{bankruptcy}} system (Ley Concursal), which {{entered into}} force in 2004, 50 applied to consumers and {{all types of}} firms, including both limited liability companies and personally owned businesses with no limit to personal liability. In September 2013 the Spanish Parliament approved some legal reforms in this regard that are summarised in Appendix A. 6. By contrast, there are specific procedures for personal debtors both in France and the UK, which may be used by consumers, self-employed individuals and owners of small firms that used personal guarantees to fund their businesses. France has two procedures, the plan de redressement and the procedure de rétablissement personnel, while bankruptcy is the main insolvency procedure for individuals in the UK. 51 It is necessary to remark that, in the UK, the term “bankruptcy” only applies to individuals, while insolvency is the term that is used for companies.

40|$|The {{question}} as to whether aggrieved shareholders should rank equally with creditors in cases of insolvency involving illegal or misleading conduct sits at the crossroads of both insolvency and securities law. Important questions arise at this juncture concerning the fairness, certainty, transparency and efficiency of the treatment of such claims when in competition with creditor claims. In Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1 the High Court allowed shareholders to rank equally with unsecured creditors in insolvency cases involving illegal or misleading behaviour, flying in the face of traditional perceptions of the distinction between debt and equity, and the primacy historically accorded to creditors upon insolvency.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade or so a number of banking crises has {{occurred}} in both industrial and developing countries. Bank unsoundness is the focus of deep concerns for its possible interactions with macroeconomic instability. The potential size and severity of sovereign debt crises in integrated financial markets were highlighted by the outbreak of the Mexican crisis at the end of 1994. Subsequently, in a number of international bodies policy makers have undertaken to consider various avenues and arrangements to prevent, anticipate and resolve sovereign debt crises. In the second half of 1997, East Asia's turmoil testified to the interdependence between currency devaluations, stockmarket crashes, and banks' <b>insolvencies.</b> After a <b>general</b> discussion of financial crises and bank runs, the paper discusses the prototype case of banks for which both established economic doctrine and the practical experience of policy makers and regulators offer clearer indications. Then it turns to countries exploring interactions, analogies and differences with the case of banks. Fundamental differences remain between the cases of financial intermediaries and nations. Ultimately the decision of a sovereign state to default or suspend its debt-service payments is largely a voluntary one and the safeguards against moral hazard built into domestic bankruptcy codes cannot be applied to it. Important consequences follow in terms of international co-ordination and the function of the "lender of last resort"...|$|R

Nevertheless, the privatization (and restructuring) of socially owned enterprises {{is one of the}} key requirements for enhancing business performances of the real sector and entire economy. Although relatively satisfactory results of key macro economic trends in Serbia have been realized in previous period, it could not be stated that all desired and expected effects have been efficiently realized up to now. As a result, according to the World Economic Forum Report, the Serbian economy is at 91 place among 130 countries on the level of competitiveness. Partly, it’s a result of unsatisfactory trends in the field of real sector privatization and restructuring.

In 2008, Australia enacted a standalone statute, the Cross-border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) to which is annexed the Model Law. In that process, it made minimal changes to the Model Law text. Against the background of the 2008 Act, related procedural laws as well as Australia’s <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> statutes and recent cross-border insolvency jurisprudence, this article comments on the potential relevance of the Transnational Insolvency Report as a point of reference for Australian courts and insolvency administrators when addressing international insolvency cases.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{considers the}} topical {{issue of the}} relationship between secured transactions and insolvency laws in the light of two recent international instruments, the 2001 Cape Town Convention on international interests on mobile equipment and the (at the time) Draft UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions. Both instruments, though differing in their scope of application and in their nature, pursue the primary goal of promoting secured credit through efficient and clear rules. Such a goal may be, however, in contrast with national insolvency law policies, especially when rescue of the defaulting debtor's economic activity is attempted. Thus, the international uniform rules should try to find an - admittedly difficult - balance between the need to foster reorganisation procedures and the goal of encouraging pre-commencement financing of enterprises. The contribution considers several aspects which are crucial to the relationship between the pre-commencement creditor rights and insolvency-related policies: avoidance of preferential transactions, priority of liens arising by operation of law, opportunity to limit all-encompassing security devices in favour of (certain) unsecured creditors, tension between creditors’ preferential satisfaction and rescue proceedings, treatment of title retention instruments in insolvency. After a thorough analysis of the uniform law provisions dealing with the above mentioned aspects, the conclusion is reached that both the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide and the Cape Town Convention offer a number of fruitful suggestions towards finding a balanced solution, while the Aircraft Protocol to the Cape Town Convention shows a marked preference for enhancing the secured creditor's position to the detriment of <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> policies.

Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) followed the Report titled, “Administration of a Company’s Affairs with a View to Executing a Deed of Company Arrangement” and operates from 23 June 1993. The deed of company arrangement allows for the creditors and the company debtor to come to an alternate arrangement between themselves to enable the chances of a company within the zone of insolvency a chance of survival and as an alternative to liquidation of the company. This fresh start ideal is a key underpinning feature of modern insolvency and bankruptcy law. The Australian corporate rescue provisions however have been in place for over 20 years and remain largely unaltered. Whilst this is a testament to inter alia clarity of drafting, there are signs that perhaps {{now is the time to}} review {{the operation of}} the deed of company arrangement provisions, especially in the light of court judgments regarding secured credit and deeds of company arrangement that appear to be at odds with the purpose and drafting of rescue provisions speciﬁcally and corporate insolvency generally.

I do not think this <b>general</b> <b>insolvency,</b> which involves in some sort all the population, to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and other times, in bestowing gifts; since it is always so pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to pay debts. But the impediment lies in the choosing. If at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody, I am puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone. Flowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because they are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house. Nature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws. Yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty. Men use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted. Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed? Fruits are acceptable gifts, because they are the flower of commodities, and admit of fantastic values being attached to them. If a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of fine summer-fruit, I should think there was some proportion between the labor and the reward.|$|R

The dissertation entails an analysis of core insolvency standards and related principles, which are highly significant when (re-) designing or reforming the insolvency regime of a country in the transition process. There, the author intends to examine those issues from a potential legislator's point of view, whereby the benefits and repercussions associated with such standards are analysed {{in the context of}} the particular economical, social and political needs of the jurisdictions in question. The aim of the thesis is to discuss the policy objectives facing a potential legislator in a country seeking to reform its insolvency regime and to offer guidelines that support good practise standards in the countries in question. Furthermore, the paper attempts to articulate a comprehensive statement about the various and competing goals that underlie the insolvency system, particularly in a transition economy. As a result the paper identifies several key principles that should form the basis of any insolvency regime. Furthermore, the outcome of the research points out, certain issues will be of more importance for transition economies than for developed countries, and vice versa. Some of the issues, characteristic particularly to transition economies, are attempted to reflect in this paper. What does the term transition economy mean in the context of insolvency law?

Do <b>general</b> objectives of <b>insolvency</b> regimes differ in transition economies from those in highly developed countries?
