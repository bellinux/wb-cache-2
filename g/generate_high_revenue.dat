40|$|This article {{experimentally}} studies a two-stage elimination {{contest and}} compares its performance with a one-stage contest. Contrary to the theory, the two-stage contest <b>generates</b> <b>higher</b> <b>revenue</b> than the equivalent one-stage contest. There is significant over-dissipation in both {{stages of the}} two-stage contest and experience diminishes over-dissipation {{in the first stage}} but not in the second stage. Our experiment provides evidence that winning is a component in a subject’s utility. A simple behavioral model that accounts for a non-monetary utility of winning can explain significant over-dissipation in both contests. It can also explain why the two-stage contest <b>generates</b> <b>higher</b> <b>revenue</b> than the equivalent one-stage contest. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} managerial {{question is}} {{the choice of the}} pricing rule. We study whether this choice depends on the uncertainty about the number of participating bidders by comparing expected revenues under discriminatory and uniform pricing within an auction model with affiliated values, stochastic number of bidders, and linear bidding strategies. We show that if uncertainty about the number of bidders is substantial, then the discriminatory pricing <b>generates</b> <b>higher</b> expected <b>revenues</b> than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price auction might <b>generate</b> <b>higher</b> <b>revenues</b> than the second-price auction. Therefore, uncertainty about the number of bidders is an important factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule. We also study whether eliminating this uncertainty, i. e., revealing the number of bidders, is in the seller's interests, and discuss the existence of an increasing symmetric equilibrium. discriminatory pricing, uniform pricing, auctions, demand uncertainty, stochastic number of bidders...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the secret reservation price in eBay auctions. Under {{the assumptions of}} secret and public reservation price, the bidders choose the optimal bidding function and the seller selects equilibrium reservation price. This model argues that the choice of secret reservation price is rational for the seller, as they can <b>generate</b> <b>higher</b> <b>revenue</b> in certain conditions. It predicts that, under endogenous entry, secret reservation price leads to <b>higher</b> <b>revenue</b> since it attracts more bidders to the auction. This effect is more noticeable for luxury goods. However, secret and public reservation prices generate identical revenue for the seller if entry is exogenous. Furthermore, the results are supported by numerous recent empirical works. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The current cloud {{computing}} platforms allocate virtual machine instances to their users through fixed-price allocation mechanisms. We argue that combinatorial auction-based allocation mechanisms are especially efficient over the fixed-price mechanisms since the virtual machine instances {{are assigned to}} users having the highest valuation. We formulate the problem of virtual machine allocation in clouds as a combinatorial auction problem and propose two mechanisms to solve it. We perform extensive simulation experiments to compare the two proposed combinatorial auction-based mechanisms with the currently used fixed-price allocation mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the combinatorial auction-based mechanisms can significantly improve the allocation efficiency while <b>generating</b> <b>higher</b> <b>revenue</b> for the cloud providers.

We first establish an integrated approach of the different attributes that producers and consumers attach to 'superior' quality.

On the contrary, the clustering of producers in function of their adherence to a label gives clear differences in labour income.
