5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up,</b> not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E
5|$|The axiom of {{foundation}} {{proposed that}} every set {{can be constructed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> in an ordered succession of steps {{by way of the}} principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in set theory.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Liberty Bend Bridge {{was built}} in 1927, and was dismantled in 1973. After the new river channel was cut and the new bridge build over it in 1949, the old bridge continued to carry traffic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>up</b> to Arsenal Hill, spanning the old riverbed and also crossing the railroad tracks. The then 291, now Southview Dr, continued north. In the early 1970s the new four-lane divided 291 was built along the eastside of the old highway, and the new Independence-Liberty Bridge (the pair of bridges now carrying 291 across the railroad) was built alongside the old Liberty Bend Bridge. It was then, that the old bridge was torn down.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the central}} tenets in Easterly’s {{approach}} is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies {{not only to the}} identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up,</b> rather than being given to a specific government.|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{get more}} {{quantitative}} information out of a mass spectrum {{is to create a}} standard curve to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an internal standard which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> to be quantitative.|$|E

25|$|The book {{is perhaps}} most {{important}} {{in the manner in}} which it provides the viewpoint of one of Wellington's foot soldiers at a time when so many were illiterate. Whilst some officers kept diaries or wrote memoirs of their service, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is rare because unlike the grand actions or great people recalled by his superiors, Harris mentions dozens of men whose history is no longer remembered and whose names would otherwise be lost, and records the details of daily ennui with interesting and colloquial prose. He describes medicine from a patient's point of view, punishment from a friend of the victim's view, and military life <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up,</b> giving insight to the daily life of a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a valuable primary source to some of the British campaigns of the period.|$|E
25|$|Presbyterian polity was {{developed}} as a rejection of governance by hierarchies of single bishops (episcopal polity), but also differs from the congregationalist polity in which each congregation is independent. In contrast {{to the other two}} forms, authority in the presbyterian polity flows both from the top down (as higher assemblies exercise limited but important authority over individual congregations, e.g., only the presbytery can ordain ministers, install pastors, and start up, close, and approve relocating a congregation) and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> (e.g., the moderator and officers are not appointed from above but are rather elected by and from among the members of the assembly). This theory of governance developed in Geneva under John Calvin and was introduced to Scotland by John Knox after his period of exile in Geneva. It is strongly associated with French, Dutch, Swiss and Scottish Reformation movements, and the Reformed and Presbyterian churches.|$|E
2500|$|James Lockhart, {{who specializes}} in the {{historical}} description of the Nahua, said Aztec society was characterized by a [...] "tendency to create larger wholes by the aggregation of parts that remain relatively separate and self-contained brought together by their common function and similarity". This understanding entails a social stratification that is built <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> – <b>up,</b> rather than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top – down. Aztec hierarchy by this understanding was not of the type [...] "where a unit of one type – the capital – controls subordinate units of another type" [...] but instead a type where the main unit is composed out of several constituent parts.|$|R

25|$|Seth Kaplan (2011) {{argues that}} in {{contrast}} to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up,</b> with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa {{because it has been}} largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up,</b> or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E

40|$|High {{aspect ratio}} {{semiconductor}} nanostructures {{are becoming more}} prevalent in many applications including solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), field effect transistors (FETs), thermo-electric devices, and sensing. 15 These nanostructures can be formed <b>from</b> either <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> by growth or the top-down by etching.

For silicon, such surface damage can be repaired by thermal anneal-ing. However, for compound semiconductors, such as GaAs, thermal repair is not completely effective mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining stoichiometry. 7, 8 One top-down etching method, which is becoming increasingly more favorable, is metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch), a simple directional we...|$|R
