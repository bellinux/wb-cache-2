5|$|Minnesotans {{participate}} in {{high levels of}} physical activity, {{and many of these}} activities are outdoors. The strong interest of Minnesotans in <b>environmentalism</b> has been attributed to the popularity of these pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as <b>environmentalism,</b> pacifism, feminism, love and family. His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} Morris's preservationism was {{his desire to}} protect the natural world from the ravages of {{pollution}} and industrialism, causing some historians of the green movement to regard Morris as an important forerunner of modern <b>environmentalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Environment. Several of the candidates, {{including}} Berry and Goldsmith, are long-standing environmental campaigners. Berry put sustainability at {{the centre}} of her campaign, while Goldsmith linked <b>environmentalism</b> more closely to economic growth, and Khan pledged a range of green policies, including a programme to plant over 2 million trees in London while mayor.|$|E
5|$|Raelians deride {{the current}} state-system as {{inadequate}} {{for dealing with}} contemporary global issues that are typical of Globalisation, such as <b>Environmentalism,</b> Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Crass were an English art {{collective}} and punk rock band formed in 1977 who promoted anarchism {{as a political}} ideology, {{a way of life}} and a resistance movement. Crass popularised the anarcho-punk movement of the punk subculture, advocating direct action, animal rights, feminism and <b>environmentalism.</b> The band used and advocated a DIY punk ethic approach to its sound collages, leaflets, albums and films.|$|E
5|$|Gore {{then begins}} his slide show on Global Warming; a {{comprehensive}} presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several {{photographs of the}} Earth taken from multiple space missions, as Earthrise and The Blue Marble. Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed {{the way we see}} the Earth, helping spark modern <b>environmentalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has {{an active}} program of {{organized}} amateur and professional sports. Tourism {{has become an}} important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber has largely {{been transformed into a}} vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and <b>environmentalism,</b> added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed {{greater emphasis on}} conservation. With public sentiment tending towards <b>environmentalism,</b> Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program also}} {{affected}} environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos {{taken by the}} astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is The Blue Marble. This image, which was released during a surge in <b>environmentalism,</b> {{became a symbol of}} the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{influenced}} later works {{within the}} Jim Henson universe as well, including {{the television show}} Dinosaurs produced by The Jim Henson Company. The first episode of Dinosaurs featured a plot line supporting <b>environmentalism</b> that was similar to an episode of The Land of Gorch. The Land of Gorch segment from the November 8, 1975 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Candice Bergen included themes that were reused in Dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of <b>environmentalism</b> and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s green {{became the}} color of a number of new European {{political}} parties organized around an agenda of <b>environmentalism.</b> Green was chosen for its association with nature, health, and growth. The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|Journalists have {{described}} the episode as a satire on both American politics and <b>environmentalism.</b> It won an Environmental Media Award in 1991 for being the best television episode of the year with an environmental message. Since the episode first aired, the three-eyed fish Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.8, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and <b>environmentalism.</b> Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or <b>environmentalism</b> as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
5|$|Two Timmy and Lassie episodes {{launched}} Campbell's Soup premiums, {{while two}} others promoted a UNICEF Halloween {{project and the}} Peace Patrol, a children's savings bond program spearheaded by Lassie and The Lone Ranger. The same seasons saw several Christmas episodes, while conservation and <b>environmentalism</b> were brought center stage. Some scripts dealt with race and ethnicity with both Jeff and Timmy championing Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Aging Americans were presented {{in a positive light}} during the years when Andy Clyde was featured as Martin family friend/neighbor Cully Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to <b>environmentalism</b> that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both <b>environmentalism</b> and democracy.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream <b>environmentalism</b> of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. It was decided beforehand the film would be a direct sequel, to exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film. Just as Casino Royale theme was terrorism, the sequel focuses on <b>environmentalism.</b> The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role. Roger Michell, who directed Craig in Enduring Love and The Mother, was in negotiations to direct, but opted out because there was no script. Sony Entertainment vice-chairman Jeff Blake admitted a production schedule of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade completed their draft of the script by April 2007, and Paul Haggis, who polished the Casino Royale script, began his rewrite the next month.|$|E
5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including <b>environmentalism,</b> antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced <b>environmentalism,</b> campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste of natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

25|$|From the 1970s onwards, <b>environmentalism</b> {{became an}} {{increasing}} {{concern of the}} left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing Builders Labourers Federation in Australia, led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place Green Bans on environmentally destructive development projects. Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged <b>environmentalism</b> and anti-capitalism into an eco-socialist ideology. Barry Commoner articulated a left-wing response to The Limits to Growth model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred <b>environmentalism,</b> postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures. Environmental degradation {{can be seen as}} a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.|$|E
