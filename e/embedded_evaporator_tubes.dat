40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to reveal the {{mechanisms}} of corrosion processes of outer surfaces of low-emission steam boiler <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes.</b> Examinations were performed to find the reasons of different corrosion susceptibility of tubes situated at combustion chamber on various levels. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations were conducted on several segments of Ø 57 x 5. 0 mm <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes</b> made of 16 M (16 Mo 3) steel grade. Segments were taken from level of 10 meters and 18 meters from the chamber bottom of low-emission coal fired steam boiler after two years operation. Microstructure degradation of base material was estimated. Metallographic evaluation of scale morphology, its micro sites chemical composition analysis and distribution of elements on cross sections have been performed. Findings: Eexaminations of <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes</b> indicated that reduction of wall thickness was considerable at the segments taken from level of 10 m, when at level of 18 m this reduction was small. The morphology of scales consisted of external layer which was porous and weakly connected to the tube surface, and internal layer, which was dense and adherent to the base metal. In these two layers the bands reach in sulfur were detected. The sulfide corrosion seems to be the main degradation mechanism of the tube surface at the level of 10 m. Research limitations/implications: Corrosion of the water wall tubes in low-emission steam boilers is a result of reaction of steel tube surface with the aggressive substoichiometric environment contains sulfur. The chemical composition of flue gases changes along the water wall. The exact compound of flue gases has not been determined in this study. Practical implications: Prevention of water wall tubes corrosion can be achieved by changing in operation conditions or replacement of tube materials. The first mentioned action is limited to accurate burner’s adjustment or introduces a flow of additional air along the walls and create air curtain between reducing environment and tubes surface. These efforts often are insufficient. The replacement of more corrosion resistant material on Cr rich steel or Cr-Ni steel is possible but other problems appear connected with high costs of installation and low heat transfer coefficients of such materials. Knowing the mechanisms of corrosion allows adjusting combustion process at low emission steam boilers. Originality/value: Information available in literature does not clearly indicate what mechanism of corrosion is dominant at different parts of combustion chamber.

40|$|A {{computer}} algorithm {{has been}} developed to simulate two-phase thermosiphon coil loop heat exchanger systems in which each coil consists of parallel rows of tubes running between common headers. The coils may be oriented in any arbitrary fashion relative to the gravitational field, subject to the limitation that the condensate {{must be able to}} return by gravity to the evaporator and may be subject to different external flow and thermal conditions. The developed program requires the operator to specify the source and sink fluid approach temperature and face velocities; the source and sink fluid to coil inner surface heat transfer coefficients; and the size and orientation of the various system components. The simulated performance was compared to each of the following three very different experimental systems: (1) Water jacketed <b>evaporator</b> and condenser <b>tubes.</b> This system was studied by Raza.

Substantial experience in deposit formation and management has been gained in conventional goal and oil/gas boilers over time. The role of boiling modes in the steam generator tubes is very critical to areas of deposit formation. Incipient boiling, nucleate boiling and convective boiling modes all have different deposition behavior. When Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) power plants of larger size (> 100 MW) began operation in the 1990 ’s, deposits in <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes</b> were not considered a significant issue.

40|$|A complex {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} climbing film evaporator, based on rigorous material and heat balances, was developed by Peacock and Starzak (1996). Empirical correlations were {{used to describe the}} heat transfer and hydrodynamics within the <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes,</b> taking account of the different regimes of heat transfer and fluid flow encountered during evaporation. The model was used to modify the existing nucleate boiling heat transfer correlation by fitting experimental data from the Felixton (FX) pilot plant climbing film evaporator. Because of the complexity of the model and the extensive computational time required for solution, the amount of data correlated had to be severely limited. In order to overcome this difficulty, a new simplified model is proposed. This was found to be an acceptable approximation of the complex model, giving very similar solutions under all of the process conditions tested. The simplified model was used in the study of three useful practical applications: determination of the effect of juice flow rate on the overall heat transfer coefficient in a climbing film evaporator, influence of juice recycle on evaporator performance, and optimal <b>evaporator</b> <b>tube</b> configuration for the performance of a given heat transfer duty.

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{design feature}} of steam boiler with natural circulation {{is the presence}} of the steam drum which plays a role of the separator of vapor from the flow of water-and-steam mixture coming into steam drum from the furnace tubes. Steam drum with unheated downcomer tubes, deducing from it, and riser (screen/furnace tubes) inside the furnace is a closed circulation loop in which movement of water (downcomer tubes) and water-and-steam mixture (riser tubes) is organized. The movement of the working fluid is appears due to occurrence of the natural pressure, determined by the difference in hydrostatic pressure and the mass of water and water-and-steam mixtures in downcomer and riser tubes and called the driving pressure of the natural circulation: S drive = H steam (ρ down + ρ mix) g where: ρ down - density of water in downcomer tubes; ρ mix - density of water in riser tubes; H steam - height of steam content section; g - acceleration of gravity. In steam boilers with natural circulation the circulation rate is usually between 10 and 30. Thus, consumption of water in the circulation circuit “circulation rate times” more than steam output of the boiler. There are two aspects of the design of natural water circulation loops. One is to ensure a sufficient mass flux of circulating water to avoid burnout of <b>evaporator</b> <b>tubes.</b> The other is to avoid tube wall temperature fluctuation and tube vibration due to oscillation of circulation velocity. The design criteria are therefore reduced, in principle, to those of critical heat flux, critical flow rate for burnout, and flow instability.

The fluids were tested on the smooth tube at operating temperatures of 4 C and 20 'C, and 19 fins per inch tube at 4 C. Results of the experiments show that the enhancements of pool boiling heat transfer varied within the range of 6 % to 570 % depending upon the type of refrigerant, pool temperature, applied voltage and type of <b>evaporator</b> <b>tube</b> surface.

The exhaust gases’ heat transfer coefficient increased with the evaporator’ tube length in all zones. The results were compared with result by other authors and were found to be in agreement...|$|R

The one-dimensional separate model of two-phase flow and heat transfer in a closed thermosyphon loop with minichannels and minipump {{has been used in}} calculations. The latest correlations for minichannels available in literature have been applied. This model is based on mass, momentum, and energy balances in the <b>evaporator,</b> rising <b>tube,</b> condenser and the falling tube. A numerical analysis of the mass flux and heat transfer coefficient in the steady state has been presented...|$|R

Evaporation of black liquor up to higher dry solid content gives a higher heating value of the black liquor used in the recovery boiler. A high dry solid content means that the viscosity of the black liquor becomes very high. The link between viscosity and heat transfer for black liquor is therefore interesting. Experimental and theoretical knowledge is essential for proper design of evaporators for this purpose. A simplified model for the black liquor falling-film evaporation heat transfer coefficient is suggested. Without a substantial increase in uncertainty, only dependence on mass flow rate and viscosity is included in the model. The model is created from experimental data from experiments performed with a research evaporation plant with a 4. 5 m long <b>evaporator</b> <b>tube.</b> Heat transfer in falling-film evaporators has been studied by other researchers before. The falling-film black liquor evaporation heat transfer coefficient dependence on mass flow rate (in a limited mass flow rate range) and viscosity according to this study is in agreement with some of these earlier studies. Above a certain mass flow rate limit, however, the experimental heat transfer coefficient was constant or even decreased with increasing mass flow rate...|$|R
