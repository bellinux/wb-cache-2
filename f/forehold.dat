2500|$|A new {{steelwork}} {{lower deck}} of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature {{was installed in}} the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the <b>forehold</b> to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship's starboard quarter. The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, {{which leads to the}} lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in Classic Boat magazine's September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that [...] "The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore". Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw's proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust's own engineer Peter Mason.|$|E
6000|$|... "So Jefferson {{made the}} pump go, {{and ran the}} <b>forehold</b> dry!" [...] he said. [...] "When ye {{come to think of}} it, yon is an ingenious man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is difficult, indeed," [...] Matteo said, [...] "seeing {{that the}} Genoese sailors are {{quartered}} in the forecastle above the <b>forehold,</b> while the officers {{will be in}} the cabins in the poop over us." ...|$|E
60|$|Followed by Rosey, Renshaw and Nott hurriedly {{sought the}} lower deck {{and the open}} hatch of the <b>forehold.</b> The two men leaped down first with the lantern, and then {{assisted}} Rosey to descend. Renshaw {{took a step forward}} and uttered a cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "The first {{lieutenant}} {{is in the}} <b>forehold,</b> sir; all {{the marines}} have got their dead-lights still in, and the master is working-up his log, the gun-room steward says. I hope these will do, sir; they are the greatest idlers in the ship, I believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jarl Hakon was {{led up to}} the king's ship. He was the handsomest {{man that}} could be seen. He had long hair as fine as silk, bound about his head with a gold ornament. When he sat down in the <b>forehold</b> the king said to him: ...|$|E
60|$|They {{went and}} searched the <b>forehold</b> {{but could not}} find that the Swallow had taken any harm worth noting. Indeed, her massive oaken prow, {{with the weight of}} the gale-driven ship behind it, had crashed through the frail sides of the open Spanish boat like a knife through an egg.|$|E
60|$|Maisie {{looked more}} than usually kissable {{as she stepped}} from the night-mail on to the windy pier, in a gray {{waterproof}} and a little gray cloth travelling-cap. The red-haired girl was not so lovely. Her green eyes were hollow and her lips were dry. Dick saw the trunks aboard, and went to Maisie's side in the darkness under the bridge. The mail-bags were thundering into the <b>forehold,</b> and the red- haired girl was watching them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. Only two {{or three}} tons which are down in the <b>forehold</b> {{together}} are for Enkhuizen, the rest are for Leyden and the Hague. I told the merchants that if they put their goods on board I must sail past the ports and make straight on to Enkhuizen; for that first of all I must bring Mistress Martin to the captain, but that I would go round and discharge their goods as soon as I had brought her here. It was only on these terms I agreed to take the cargo." ...|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Nott had {{satisfied}} {{himself of}} Renshaw's departure, he coolly bolted {{the door at}} the head of the companion way, thus cutting off any communication with the lower deck. Taking a long rifle from the rack above his berth, he carefully examined the hammer and cap, and then cautiously let himself down through the forehatch to the deck below. After a deliberate survey of the still intact fastenings of the hatch over the <b>forehold,</b> he proceeded quietly to unloose them again with the aid of the tools that still lay there. When the hatch was once more free he lifted it, and, withdrawing a few feet from the opening, sat himself down, rifle in hand. A profound silence reigned throughout the lower deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Nott thoughtfully, plucking at his bushy whiskers {{with his}} fingers and thumb {{as if he were}} removing dead and sapless incumbrances in their growth, [...] "that's just what it is--them's ez in it themselves don't pay, and them ez haz left their goods--the goods don't pay. The feller ez stored them iron sugar kettles in the <b>forehold,</b> after {{trying to get me to}} make another advance on 'em, sez he believes he'll have to sacrifice 'em to me after all, and only begs I'd give him a chance of buying back the half of 'em ten years from now, at double what I advanced him. The chap that left them five hundred cases of hair dye 'tween decks and then skipped out to Sacramento, met me the other day in the street and advised me to use a bottle ez an advertisement, or try it on the starn of the Pontiac for fireproof paint. That foolishness ez all he's good for. And yet thar might be suthin' in the paint, if a feller had nigger luck. Ther's that New York chap ez bought up them damaged boxes of plug terbakker for fifty dollars a thousand, and sold 'em for foundations for that new building in Sansome Street at a thousand clear profit. It's all luck, Rosey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not think}} of danger just then. I might have been a little startled: all this {{happened}} in such a quiet way and so very suddenly. I knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the forepeak from the <b>forehold.</b> I went back to tell the captain. I came upon the second engineer getting up {{at the foot of the}} bridge-ladder: he seemed dazed, and told me he thought his left arm was broken; he had slipped on the top step when getting down while I was forward. He exclaimed, [...] "My God! That rotten bulkhead'll give way in a minute, and the damned thing will go down under us like a lump of lead." [...] He pushed me away with his right arm and ran before me up the ladder, shouting as he climbed. His left arm hung by his side. I followed up in time to see the captain rush at him and knock him down flat on his back. He did not strike him again: he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low. I fancy he was asking him why the devil he didn't go and stop the engines, instead of making a row about it on deck. I heard him say, [...] "Get up! Run! fly!" [...] He swore also. The engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine-room companion which was on the port side. He moaned as he ran. [...] .' ...|$|E
6000|$|At this point--it was off Rodosto--enter a small steamer {{which does}} not halt when requested, and so is fired at with [...] "several rounds" [...] from a rifle. The crew, on being told to abandon her, tumble into their boats with such haste that they capsize two out of three. [...] "Fortunately," [...] says E11, [...] "they are {{able to pick up}} everybody." [...] You can imagine to {{yourself}} the confusion alongside, the raffle of odds and ends floating out of the boats, and the general parti-coloured hurrah's-nest all over the bright broken water. What you cannot imagine is this: [...] "An American gentleman then appeared on the upper deck who informed us that his name was Silas Q. Swing, of the Chicago Sun, and that he was pleased to make our acquaintance. He then informed us that the steamer was proceeding to Chanak and he wasn't sure if there were any stores aboard." [...] If anything could astonish the Trade at this late date, one would almost fancy that the apparition of Silas Q. Swing ("very happy to meet you, gentlemen") might have started a rivet or two on E11's placid skin. But she never even quivered. She kept a lieutenant of the name of D'Oyley Hughes, an expert in demolition parties; and he went aboard the tramp and reported any quantity of stores--a six-inch gun, for instance, lashed {{across the top of the}} forehatch (Silas Q. Swing must have been an unobservant journalist), a six-inch gun-mounting in the <b>forehold,</b> pedestals for twelve-pounders thrown in as dunnage, the afterhold full of six-inch projectiles, and a scattering of other commodities. They put the demolition charge well in among the six-inch stuff, and she took it all to the bottom in a few minutes, after being touched off.|$|E
60|$|He {{had reached}} the passage when the door he had just opened was {{suddenly}} darkened. Turning rapidly, he was conscious of a gaunt figure, grotesque, silent, and erect, looming on the threshold {{between him and the}} sky. Hidden in the shadow, he made a stealthy step towards it, with an iron wrench in his uplifted hand. But the next moment his eyes dilated with superstitious horror; the iron fell from his hand, and with a scream, like a frightened animal, he turned and fled into the passage. In the first access of his blind terror he tried to reach the deck above through the forehatch, but was stopped by the sound of a heavy tread overhead. The immediate fear of detection now overcame his superstition; he would have even faced the apparition again to escape through the loft; but, before he could return there, other footsteps approached rapidly {{from the end of the}} passage he would have to traverse. There was but one chance of escape left now--the <b>forehold</b> he had just quitted. He might hide there until the alarm was over. He glided back to the hatch, lifted it, and closed it softly over his head as the upper hatch was simultaneously raised, and the small round eyes of Abner Nott peered down upon it. The other footsteps proved to be Renshaw's, but, attracted by the open door of the loft, he turned aside and entered. As soon as he disappeared Mr. Nott cautiously dropped through the opening to the deck below, and, going to the other hatch through which the Lascar had vanished, deliberately refastened it. In a few moments Renshaw returned with a light, and found the old man sitting on the hatch.|$|E
