2500|$|The {{concept of}} Zion in the Community of Christ relates to a {{theology}} of the [...] "kingdom of God". As a doctrine, it is therefore closely founded upon the kingdom parables of Jesus as recorded in the four gospels. Based on references in the Bible to Mt. Zion or simply Zion, it was initially regarded as a city, sometimes called the New Jerusalem. Prior to 1920, {{most members of the}} Community of Christ identified Independence, Missouri, as Zion or the New Jerusalem. As New Testament understandings of basileia, as the realm or the domain of God, have gradually taken root among members of the denomination, Zion is now understood more as a cause, as a way of living or as a state of existence, and is usually not regarded as having its foundation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>place.</b> Officially, the denomination states that [...] "he 'cause of Zion' expresses our commitment to pursuing God's kingdom through the establishment of Christ-centered communities in families, congregations, neighborhoods, cities, and throughout the world." [...] While the Concept of Zion is rarely associated with the Jewish concept of Zionism, some members of the Community of Christ from Maine, intrigued by the doctrine of Zion, established a refugee center near Tel Aviv during the initial return of the Jewish diaspora to Israel in the early 1900s.|$|E

When revenue service began, [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies), trains that {{show up on the}} computer system as being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>place</b> but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 volts rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection. Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of [...] Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking— operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights — that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between Westinghouse, the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the state government (advised by University of California professor Dr. Bill Wattenburg), the federal government, and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service. Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system. In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: The term "autobiographical memory" (AuM) {{refers to}} contextually bound {{experiences}} that occurred <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> time, <b>place,</b> and affective setting. AuM is {{a component of}} memory commonly impaired in amnestic disorders. Alteration occurs rarely in isolation but rather {{in the setting of}} a larger memory impairment. Isolated AuM deficit is a controversial clinical entity, however, recently reported in the context of temporal lobe epilepsy. This study aims at characterizing this poorly documented clinical syndrome and at discussing its potential pathophysiological basis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a group of three subjects with a history of pharmacosensitive epilepsy and severe AuM complaints. They all were submitted to a neuropsychological evaluation that included an extensive episodic memory assessment, along with wake/sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: We observed the following findings: preserved autonomy and intact global cognitive functioning; normal performance to standardized episodic memory assessment, contrasting with decreased performance to specific AuM evaluation; frontal and/or temporal epileptic activity on EEG; and normal structural brain MRI. CONCLUSION: We reported on a group of patients exhibiting selective impairment of some components of personal memory, associated with interictal frontal and/or temporal abnormalities on EEG. To account for these findings, we hypothesise that interictal epileptic-related activity is impeding long-term consolidation or storage of autobiographical material...|$|R
