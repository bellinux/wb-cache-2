50|$|Metal Foil <b>Deep</b> <b>Etching</b> is a {{plastograph}} {{print in}} which aluminium foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then laminated on plywood or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the foils into a print medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique.

This paper examines the practicality of using acid etching of the tooth surface to extract amino acids from the enamel for racemization analysis. By serial etching of the tooth and contamination of the teeth with bovine serum albumin prior to etching, the ability of etching to remove contamination was assessed. The destructiveness of the method was visualized and quantified using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). By bleaching the teeth and by <b>deeper</b> <b>etching</b> it was possible to obtain more consistent values. While etching had little effect on the enamel at the macroscale, it did have an impact at the microscale.

Two very thin defect layers due to residual photoresist materials have been observed at the MR sensor-exchange layer interface and exchange-conducting layer interface.
