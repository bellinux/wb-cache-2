5000|$|The order <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> (meaning [...] "hairy tail") {{comprises}} {{most of the}} Australian carnivorous marsupials, including quolls, dunnarts, the numbat, the Tasmanian devil, and the thylacine. In Australia, {{the exceptions}} include the omnivorous bandicoots (order Peramelemorphia) and the marsupial moles (which eat meat but are very different and are now accorded an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia). Numerous South American species of marsupials (orders Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata, and Microbiotheria) are also carnivorous.|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} the order are polyprotodont (have several pairs of lower front teeth) - {{in the case of}} the Peramelemorphia, three pairs. This {{suggests}} that they have evolved within <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> (marsupial carnivores). On the other hand, they also have an unusual feature in their feet: the second and third toes are fused together. This condition is called syndactyly, and is characteristic of the Diprotodontia (the order of marsupial herbivores that includes kangaroos, wombats, possums, and many others).|$|E

50|$|All {{the species}} of this order are native to Australia and New Guinea; {{however it is}} unclear how closely related this order is {{to the rest of the}} marsupials. The {{bandicoots}} have two features that suggest separate and quite opposite ideas of their evolution. They have three pairs of lower front incisors, which would usually suggest evolution from the order <b>Dasyuromorphia,</b> which consists of carnivorous marsupials; however, the bandicoot's middle two digits are syndactylous, meaning they are joined together except for the claw. This would suggest they share the common ancestor of the Diprotodontia which includes the kangaroos and koalas.|$|E
50|$|All 8 {{species are}} nocturnal {{carnivores}} which hunt {{a range of}} small creatures, typically insects, larvae, insect eggs, small lizards and the young of small mammals. Although tiny, they are very bold, {{at least some of}} the species regularly take prey larger than themselves. Even the widespread common planigale, which can be found in the outer suburbs of Brisbane is poorly known. Until the improvements in biochemical analysis methods towards the end of the 20th century, very little was known about the relationships between the smaller carnivorous marsupials: it is only in recent years that it has been possible to discover that the Planigalinae are a distinct group within the <b>Dasyuromorphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{specialisation}} among marsupial predators {{is that of}} size: {{prior to}} the massive environmental changes that came about {{with the arrival of}} humans about 50,000 years ago, there were several very large carnivores, none of them members of the <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> and all of them now extinct. Those that survived into historical times ranged from the wolf-sized thylacine to the tiny long-tailed planigale which at 4 to 6 grams is less than half the size of a mouse. Most, however, tend towards {{the lower end of the}} size scale, typically between about 15 or 20 grams and about 2 kilograms, or from the size of a domestic mouse to that of a small domestic cat.|$|E
5000|$|The thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, was {{the largest}} <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> and the last living {{specimen}} of the family Thylacinidae; however, the last known specimen died in captivity in 1936.

50|$|There are, of course, {{theories}} {{using these}} features {{to describe their}} evolution. The incisors could, in fact, be analogous features shared between the bandicoot and the order <b>Dasyuromorphia.</b> They share the same function, after all, and though they are structurally similar the incisors of the carnivorous marsupials are a lot sharper than the flatter versions in the Bandicoot. The Bandicoot may have evolved the third tooth separately. If this was the case, it would seem logical that the syndactyl feet were homologous features shared between the Bandicoots and the kangaroos, wombats, possums and other species. This would make sense as syndactyly is so rare {{it is unlikely that}} it would evolve twice in two separate populations. The feet of the bandicoot when compared to, say, the kangaroo are structurally quite similar. This similarity suggests that the bandicoots share a more recent ancestor with them.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{detailed}} scientific description {{was made}} by Tasmania's Deputy Surveyor-General, George Harris in 1808, five years after first settlement of the island. Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus Didelphis, which had been created by Linnaeus for the American opossums, describing it as Didelphis cynocephala, the [...] "dog-headed opossum". Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led {{to the establishment of}} the modern classification scheme, and in 1796, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created the genus Dasyurus where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To resolve the mixture of Greek and Latin nomenclature, the species name was altered to cynocephalus. In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, Thylacinus, by Temminck. The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek θύλακος (thýlakos), meaning [...] "pouch" [...] or [...] "sack".Several studies support the thylacine as being a basal member of the <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> and the Tasmanian devil as its closest living relative. Research published in Genome Research in January 2009 suggests the numbat may be more basal than the devil. The resulting cladogram follows below: ...|$|E

These rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.The bandicoots and bilbies - order Peramelemorphia - are marsupial omnivores. There are seven species in Australia, most of which are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long, thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, because they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.Herbivorous marsupials are classified in the order Diprotodontia, and further into the suborders Vombatiformes and Phalangerida. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat. One of Australia's best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of eucalyptus. Wombats, on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on grasses, sedges and roots. Wombats use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The genome of the {{carnivorous}} marsupial, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii, Order: <b>Dasyuromorphia),</b> was sequenced in {{the hopes}} of finding a cure for or gaining {{a better understanding of the}} contagious devil facial tumor disease that is threatening the species’ survival. To better understand the Tasmanian devil genome, we screened it for transposable elements and investigated the dynamics of short interspersed e lement (SINE) retroposons. Results The temporal history of Tasmanian devil SINEs, elucidated using a transposition in transposition analysis, indicates that WSINE 1, a CORE-SINE present in around 200, 000 copies, is the most recently active element. Moreover, we discovered a new subtype of WSINE 1 (WSINE 1 b) that comprises at least 90 % of all Tasmanian devil WSINE 1 s. The frequencies of WSINE 1 subtypes differ in the genomes of two of the other Australian marsupial orders. A co-segregation analysis indicated that at least 66 subfamilies of WSINE 1 evolved during the evolution of <b>Dasyuromorphia.</b> Using a substitution rate derived from WSINE 1 insertions, the ages of the subfamilies were estimated and correlated with a newly established phylogeny of <b>Dasyuromorphia.</b> Phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates of mitochondrial genome data indicate a rapid radiation of the Tasmanian devil and the closest relative the quolls (Dasyurus) around 14 million years ago. Conclusions The radiation and abundance of CORE-SINEs in marsupial genomes indicates that they may be a major player in the evolution of marsupials. It is evident that the early phases of evolution of the carnivorous marsupial order <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> was characterized by a burst of SINE activity. A correlation between a speciation event and a major burst of retroposon activity is for the first time shown in a marsupial genome. </p...|$|E
40|$|All derived {{sequences}} {{have been}} {{deposited in the}} NCBI database (accession nos. KC 619625 –KC 620125). The Australian numbat, Myrmecobius fasciatus, is the only marsupial that feeds almost exclusively on termites and that has a life following the diurnally restricted and dynamic geographical distribution of termites. The {{millions of years of}} this adaptation led to unique morphological and anatomical features, especially basicranial and dental characteristics, that make it difficult to identify a clear phylogenetic affiliation to other marsupials. From DNA sequence analyses, the family Myrmecobiidae is placed within the dasyuromorph marsupials, but the exact position varies from study to study, and support values are mostly rather modest. Here, we report the recovery and analysis of approximately 110, 000 quasi-fossilized traces of mobile element insertions into the genome of a dasyurid marsupial (Tasmanian devil), 25 of which are phylogenetically informative for early dasyuromorphial evolution. Fourteen of these ancient retroposon insertions are shared by the 16 <b>Dasyuromorphia</b> species analyzed, including the numbat, but are absent in the outgroups. An additional 11 other insertions are present in all Dasyuridae but are absent in the numbat. These findings place numbats as the sister group to all living Dasyuridae and show that the investigated <b>Dasyuromorphia,</b> including the Myrmecobiidae, constitutes a monophyletic group that is separated from Peramelemorphia, Notoryctemorphia, and other marsupials.
