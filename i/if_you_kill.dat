500|$|Libby {{is one of}} the few main {{characters}} not to have a centric episode detailing her life before the crash. The writers said a reason for killing the character was so they could explore her backstory in a mysterious and posthumous way. The producers intended to explore Libby's backstory through flashbacks in the show's third season, and later in the fourth season, although her character did not appear. Although she appeared in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", her backstory was not explored. In September 2008, the writers stated her backstory would probably be explored in the fifth season; however, Lindelof revealed in May 2009 her story would not be explored any further, saying, [...] "I have learned that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> someone off the show, they are less likely to cooperate with you". The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments, and they could not reveal Libby's story without her.|$|E
500|$|Kung Fu Hustle makes {{references}} {{to a wide}} range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels and other sources. Sing and Bone resemble George Milton and Lennie Small from the 1992 film Of Mice and Men. The housing arrangement of the Pig Sty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. There are two {{references to}} Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer. [...] When Sing arrives at Pig Sty Alley, he plays skillfully with a soccer ball, then says, [...] "You're still playing football?". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pig Sty Alley, Sing calls him [...] "The Karate Kid", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> me, there will be thousands more of me!". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing Dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer's (the Landlady's) ill fate. In the scene in which Sing robs the ice cream vendor, a poster for the 1935 film Top Hat is in the background. As Sing arrives at the door to the Beast's cell in the mental asylum, he hallucinates a large wave of blood rushing from the cell door, similar to a scene in The Shining. The Landlady says at one point, [...] "Tomorrow is another day," [...] which is a line from the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation.|$|E

But, according to Chowdhury, he knew that us-Shan was responsible for inciting the soldiers, so he said to them: [...] "You have conspired to assassinate me. Remember that the Alamgir (Aurangzeb) will come to know everything. Abstain from doing such things, as {{it is a way of}} showing disrespect to the emperor.

2500|$|According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how {{to handle}} Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian {{appointed}} Liu Bei as the Governor (牧) of Yu Province (豫州). Someone told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you." [...] Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "I understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Villaraigosa {{vowed to}} hire 1,000 new police officers. On March 6, 2009, Mayor Villaraigosa and Police Chief Bratton {{announced}} that the L.A.P.D. had expanded to its largest force in city history. On May 14, 2009, City Council approved an LAPD/LAFD hiring freeze. In a television advertisement {{paid for by the}} Villaraigosa campaign, Chief Bratton stated that [...] "Crime is down to levels of the 1950s." [...] Twenty-four hours before the March 3 Election Day, Villaraigosa and Bratton reannounced a statement from the Mayor’s Office that the “citywide crime-rate drop to the lowest level since 1956, the total number of homicides fall to a 38-year low. Gang homicides were down more than 24 percent in 2008.” However, former Chief of Police Daryl Gates argued against this statistic, citing a trend toward lengthier prison sentences for career criminals as the reason for the change. In fact, crime fell by 43 percent across California between 1994 and 1999. The figures are also disputed by Patrick Range McDonald and Professor Andrew Karmen, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Karmen stated that, adjusting for population, the Los Angeles murder rate would need to be 180 or less to be equivalent to the crime rate of 1956, with its rate of 104 homicides per 2.2 million people, or one killing for every 22,115 people (the 2007 rate was 396 per 4 million people, or one killing per 10,101 people). McDonald further noted that, [...] "In 1956, 89 percent of homicides were cleared. Today, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> another human being in Los Angeles, chances are very good you will get away with it: 43 out of every 100 killers are not caught." [...] Similarly, he notes, [...] "In 1956, 42 percent of robberies were cleared by an arrest. Today, that number is 26 percent." ...|$|E
2500|$|When General Sherman {{decided to}} send the Kiowa war chiefs to Jacksboro for trial, he wanted an example made. [...] What he did not want, and what happened, was that the trial became a circus. [...] First, the two {{attorneys}} appointed to represent the two Kiowa actually represented them, instead of participating {{in the kind of}} civics lesson which the Army had wanted. [...] Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. [...] Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. [...] Nor were the Indians apologetic. [...] At his trail Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: [...] " [...] I am a great chief among my people. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire – a terrible fire!" [...] Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. [...] Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. [...] Thanks to the stubborn behaviour of Guipago, who forced the U.S. Government to agree seriously threatening a new bloody war, Satanta and Big Tree were freed after two years of imprisonment at the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas.|$|E
