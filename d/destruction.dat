5|$|<b>Destruction</b> Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to <b>Destruction</b> Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and <b>Destruction</b> Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E

5|$|<b>Destruction</b> Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} developed by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of <b>Destruction</b> Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, <b>Destruction</b> Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found <b>Destruction</b> Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the <b>Destruction</b> Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, <b>Destruction</b> Derby 2.|$|E

5|$|The <b>destruction</b> of Syria's {{chemical}} weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial <b>destruction</b> deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the <b>destruction</b> of its {{chemical weapons}} and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for <b>destruction.</b> The <b>destruction</b> of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual <b>destruction</b> operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of chemical weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental <b>destruction</b> using a procedural <b>destruction</b> system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental <b>destruction,</b> and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to <b>destruction,</b> players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
