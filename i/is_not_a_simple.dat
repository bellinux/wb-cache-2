5|$|Green {{marketing}} {{products that}} are presumed to be environmentally safe. It incorporates {{a broad range of}} activities, including product modification, changes to the production process, , as well as modifying advertising. Yet defining green marketing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other; an example of this will be the existence of varying social, environmental and retail definitions attached to this term.Other similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the two stanzas of the chorale is identical. The tune <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> four-part setting as in most of Bach's later cantatas, but the voices are {{embedded}} in a concerto of the orchestra, led by violin I and oboe I. The instrumental theme {{is derived from the}} first line of the chorale tune.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't {{have to worry about}} stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{process for the}} SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data {{that would not have}} otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{procedure and}} the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E

25|$|Kamban flourished {{during the}} reign of Kulothunga CholaIII. His Ramavataram (also {{referred}} to as Kambaramayanam) is an epic of Tamil literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki's Ramayana, it is generally accepted that his work <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> translation or adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. He imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time; his description of Kosala is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.|$|E
25|$|Tunnels on steep {{gradients}} {{can present}} problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power. The solution {{is analogous to}} compensation for curvature and requires the gradient in the tunnel and for some distance on either side to be greatly reduced compared to the ruling grade. Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> equation, but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels {{to find out which}} one is best, it is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.|$|E

He had visited the South to lecture, and was sympathetic to its people. Further, his Irish friend John Mitchel, who had settled in the South, supported the secessionists. Meagher and Mitchel split over the issue of slavery. Mitchel went to the Confederate capitol in Richmond, Virginia, and his three sons served with the Confederate States Army.|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} plot, or perhaps more {{accurately}} plot device, Plautus {{served as a}} source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights. The many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience the feeling of a genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and Molière. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both L'Avare and L'Etourdi, two plays by Molière, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in Miles Gloriosus. These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus' plays find their driving force, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> coincidence.|$|E
25|$|The power {{problems}} were further exacerbated by Mbeki's government policy of attracting energy-intensive industry (such as Aluminium smelters) through the carrot of cheap electricity. This meant that, as Eskom's excess capacity {{ran out and}} became a deficit, the South African government finds itself contractually bound to provide power to energy-intensive industries. Despite this meaning {{the rest of the}} country experienced traffic problems and business disruption due to the blackouts. For South Africa to remain a desirable foreign investment destination the country must be seen to honour its contractual obligations. To shut down the smelters <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> process, said one analyst. Government would be paying the cost of effects all through the relevant parties aluminium value chain – its aluminium refineries and bauxite ore mines in other countries.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{tendency}} for inter-paradigm critiques {{to focus on a}} number of assumptions that are commonly associated with P, but which actually are common to Chomskyan generative linguistics as a whole. These include innateness, modularity, the poverty of the stimulus, language universals, binarity, etc. See for example, Connectionist, Functionalist and Cognitivist critiques. As another example, the linguist Larry Trask argues that the ergative case system of the Basque language <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> binary parameter, and that different languages can have different levels of ergativity. Also, some have argued using evidence from historical linguistics that grammar is an emergent property of language use. Language evolution theorist, Terrence Deacon notes that it is problematic to consider language structure as innate - that is, as having been subject to the forces of natural selection, because languages change much too quickly for natural selection to act upon them. There are many more critiques. There is debate about the validity of these arguments, but since these are not specific to P they will not be dealt with here.|$|E
