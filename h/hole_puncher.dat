5000|$|His earlier inventions {{included}} the Autodex, a spring-operated phone directory that automatically {{opened to the}} selected letter, Swivodex, an inkwell that did not spill, Punchodex, a paper <b>hole</b> <b>puncher,</b> and Clipodex, a transcription aid that attached to a stenographer's knee.|$|E
5000|$|Comb binding (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "cerlox or surelox binding") {{is one of many}} ways to bind pages together into a book. This method uses round plastic spines with 19 rings (for US Letter size) or 21 rings (for A4 size) and a <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> that makes rectangular holes. Comb binding is sometimes {{referred to}} as plastic comb binding or spiral comb binding.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 many Belgian banks {{got money}} from the {{government}} due to a bank crisis. This was however paid with tax money. Basta contacted all those banks and requested if they could recharge their money, which was estimated at 250 euros for each Belgian inhabitant. No bank did pay them, so Basta decided to take another approach: they stole staplers, <b>hole</b> <b>punchers</b> etc. from the desks.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes steps may {{be taken}} to ensure that {{certified}} funds cannot easily be forged. These steps can include various unique stamps, inks and <b>hole</b> <b>punchers,</b> {{as well as the}} assistance of a machine such as a protectograph. Unfortunately these steps cannot prevent someone from erasing the payee's name and writing in their own name. Fraud is specifically not reimbursed by many issuer's of money orders (e.g. Western Union), and so has to go through local police. The perpetrator can then claim [...] "identity theft" [...] to the investigating detective. Such money orders can be obtained from places like rent-drop boxes.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{sense the}} book was {{inspired}} by a hole punch: [...] "One day I was punching holes with a <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> into a stack of paper, and I thought of a bookworm and so I created a story called A Week with Willi the Worm." [...] Carle was familiar with [...] "different shaped pages" [...] from books that he read as a child in Germany.|$|E
50|$|A {{hole punch}} (also {{known as a}} <b>hole</b> <b>puncher)</b> is a common office tool {{that is used to}} create holes in sheets of paper, often for the purpose of {{collecting}} the sheets in a binder or folder. A leather punch, of different construction from one designed for paper, is used for leather goods, cloth, or thin plastic sheeting. Hole punch tools are also made for use on sheet metal, such as aluminum siding or metal air ducts.|$|E
50|$|The Rolodex {{was invented}} in 1956, by the Danish {{engineer}} Hildaur Neilsen, the chief engineer of Arnold Neustadter's company Zephyr American, a stationery manufacturer in New York. First marketed in 1958, it was an improvement to an earlier design called the Wheeldex. Zephyr American also invented, manufactured and sold the Autodex, a spring-operated phone directory that automatically opened to the selected letter, Swivodex, an inkwell that did not spill, Punchodex, a paper <b>hole</b> <b>puncher,</b> and Clipodex, an office aid that attached to a stenographer's knee.|$|E
5000|$|For Disk Operating Systems {{that do not}} use {{the index}} hole in the disk to mark the {{beginnings}} of tracks, the [...] "flippy" [...] modification required only a new write-enable notch to be cut if the disk {{was designed to be}} written to. For this purpose, specially designed single-rectangular-hole punchers, commonly known as disk doublers, were produced and sold by third-party computer accessory manufacturers. Many users, however, made do with a standard (round) <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> and/or an ordinary pair of scissors for this job.|$|E
50|$|Since {{stretching}} {{is difficult}} with cartilage, those wishing {{to attain a}} larger gauge piercing more easily may opt for a dermal punch. This device functions similarly to a <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> for paper. A razor-sharp, circular blade protrudes and removes a clean disk of cartilage from the desired area. This procedure is far more common with outer conch piercings due to the area's flatness versus the much more concave shape of the inner conch in most individuals. Several clients describe the pain as comparable to a standard cartilage piercings, with others attesting that it actually hurts less.|$|E
5000|$|The Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, [...] "single-density" [...] floppy disks, but it {{was very}} common for Apple II users to extend the {{capacity}} of a single-sided floppy disk to 280 kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch {{on the side of the}} disk using a [...] "disk notcher" [...] or <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the theme}} park has reduced its {{footprint}} to Phase 1 and 2, the original Playground. It {{has introduced a}} revised system of ticketing called the ticket card system. The park is once again free entry to the general public, but guests have to buy ticket cards {{to be able to}} use the rides and attractions. These tickets come in $8 and $10 price range. The ticket cards have slots which can be punched using a single <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> - one punch equals one use of any ride or facility for one person. This system therefore gives the guest the choice to choose which ride he or she would want to use, and how many would be able to use the facility using the ticket card. An $8 ticket card has 4 slots and 1 free slot (effectively allowing one guest to use 5 rides/attractions - or 2 guests to use two rides with one extra). The $10 ticket card has 5 slots plus 3 free slots (which means a guest can use 8 rides attractions and so on). The free entry has seen a marked increase in the number of people going to the park, as shown on weekends where one can observe a large group of families having picnics in the field, or long queues on the remaining rides and attractions.|$|E

30|$|The general {{approach}} to suppress heavy-tailed interference is {{to pass the}} received observation through a ZMNL limiter. Two simple examples include a <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> and a clipper [4]. Some limiters are designed carefully according to the noise model.|$|E
30|$|The {{pattern for}} the {{microfluidic}} device was designed using AutoCAD and was produced on a high-resolution plotted film. This film was bonded to a customized quartz glass, {{resulting in a}} compositional photomask. The negative photoresist SU- 8 2075 was spin-coated onto a 4 -inch silicon wafer. A mask aligner was subsequently used for photoetching {{and led to a}} male mould in the silicon wafer. PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pre-polymer and curing agent were mixed at a ratio of 10 : 1 and rapidly stirred. The PDMS mixture was poured onto the silicon master, degassed in a vacuum oven, and then cured at 65  °C overnight. After curing, the PDMS replica containing the microchannel pattern was peeled away from the silicon master. A <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> was used to create holes in a set position to form inlets and outlets for the samples and reagents. The PDMS replica and glass slides were exposed to an oxygen plasma (Harrick Plasma, USA) for 180  s at 300  W and were then face–face bonded.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{amplitude}} {{probability density}} (APD) of the wideband {{extremely low frequency}} (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) atmospheric noise is studied. The electromagnetic signals from the atmosphere, referred to herein as atmospheric noise, was recorded by a mobile low-temperature {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) receiver under magnetically unshielded conditions. In order to eliminate the adverse effect brought by the geomagnetic activities and powerline, the measured field data was preprocessed to suppress the baseline wandering and harmonics by symmetric wavelet transform and least square methods firstly. Then statistical analysis was performed for the atmospheric noise on different time and frequency scales. Finally, the wideband ELF/VLF atmospheric noise was analyzed and modeled separately. Experimental results show that, Gaussian model is appropriate to depict preprocessed ELF atmospheric noise by a <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> operator. While for VLF atmospheric noise, symmetric α-stable (SαS) distribution is more accurate to fit the heavy-tail of the envelope probability density function (pdf) ...|$|E
30|$|Effective {{suppression}} of impulsive interferences in the signal path typically requires nonlinear means, for example, digital processing based on order statistics, and various approaches to design of nonlinear receivers with improved {{performance in the}} presence of impulsive interference have been proposed. Many of these are model-based approaches, which rely on theoretical or empirical assumptions and models of interference distributions. For example, the α-stable [17, 18] and Middleton class A, B, and C [19, 20] distributions are commonly used to model the interference in wireline [21] and wireless [22, 23] communications. Such approaches, designed under specific interference model assumptions, are often limited by parameter estimation schemes (e.g., are sensitive to inaccuracies in obtaining derivatives) and may not be robust under a model mismatch. Alternative methods that do not explicitly rely on noise distribution models have also been proposed. Those include receiver designs based on flexible classes of distributions (e.g., myriad filter [24 - 26], normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) [27]) or directly on the log-likelihood ratio shape (e.g., soft limiter [28], <b>hole</b> <b>puncher</b> [29], p-norm [27, 30, 31]).|$|E
