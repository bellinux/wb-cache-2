The spirosomes were demonstrated by negative staining to be helical structure about 6. 5 nm in width, 12. 5 nm in height and 11 nm in pitch. Their length varied considerably, ranging from 30 to 400 nm {{with a maximum}} of approximately 900 nm, but spirals measuring 100 to 200 nm were most frequent.

40|$|PNAS papers by Linus Pauling, Robert Corey, and Herman Branson in {{the spring}} of 1951 {{proposed}} the α-helix and the β-sheet, now known to form the backbones {{of tens of thousands of}} proteins. They deduced these fundamental building blocks from properties of small molecules, known both from crystal structures and from Pauling's resonance theory of chemical bonding that predicted planar peptide groups. Earlier attempts by others to build models for protein helices had failed both by including nonplanar peptides and by insisting on helices with an integral number of units per turn. In major respects, the Pauling–Corey–Branson models were astoundingly correct, including bond lengths that were not surpassed in accuracy for > 40 years. However, they did not consider the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> the <b>helix</b> or the possibility of bent sheets.

40|$|Unidirectional and rotary {{shadowing}} {{techniques have}} been applied in studying the surface structure of two types of intermediate filaments. Keratin filaments and neurofilaments demonstrate a approximately 21 -nm axial periodicity which probably indicates the helical pitch {{of the outer shell}} of the filament. Analysis of unidirectionally shadowed keratin showed that the helix is left-handed. The observation <b>of</b> a left- <b>handed</b> <b>helix</b> <b>of</b> 21 -nm pitch supports the three-stranded protofilament model of Fraser, Macrae, and Suzuki (1976, J. Mol. Biol. 108 : 435 - 452), and indicates that keratin filaments probably consist of 10 three- stranded protofilaments surrounding a core of three such protofilaments, as predicted by models based on x-ray diffraction of hard keratin filaments. Neurofilaments do not demonstrate an easily identifiable hand, so their consistency with the model is, as yet, uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Six {{rhodopsin}} mutants containing disulfide cross-links {{between different}} cytoplasmic regions were prepared: disulfide bond 1, between Cys 65 (interhelical loop I-II) and Cys 316 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VII); disulfide bond 2, between Cys 246 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI) and Cys 312 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VII); disulfide bond 3, between Cys 139 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> III) and Cys 248 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI); disulfide bond 4, between Cys 139 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> III) and Cys 250 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI); disulfide bond 5, between Cys 135 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> III) and Cys 250 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI); and disulfide bond 6, between Cys 245 (end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI) and Cys 338 (Cterminus). The effects of local restrictions {{caused by the}} cross-links on transducin (GT) activation and phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase (RK) following illumination were studied. Disulfide bond 1 showed little effect on either GT activation or phosphorylation by RK, suggesting that the relative motion between interhelical loop I-II and helix VII is not crucial for recognition by GT or by RK. In contrast, disulfide bonds 2 - 5 abolished both GT activation and phosphorylation by RK. Disulfide bond 6 resulted in enhanced GT activation but abolished phosphorylation by RK, suggesting the structure recognized by GT was stabilized in this mutant by cross-linking of the C-terminus to the cytoplasmic end <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI. Thus, {{the consequences of the}} disulfide cross-links depended on the location of the restriction. In particular, relative motions <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> VI, with respect to both helices III and VII upon light activation, are required for recognition of rhodopsin by both GT and RK. Further, the conformational changes in the cytoplasmic face that are necessary for protein-protein interactions need not be cooperative, and may be segmental...|$|R

40|$|Derivatives {{of human}} SRP-RNA were {{constructed}} by site-directed mutagenesis and tested {{for their ability}} to interact with protein SRP 19.

SRP 19 interacts to a full extent with the fourth mutant RNA composed of helices 6, 7, 8 and a portion <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> 5. It is concluded that helix 6 - and not helix 8 - is the major SRP 19 binding site. Helices 7, 8 and portions <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> 5 contribute to the formation of a functional site.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to use the model system {{described}} earlier to make direct measurements of the enthalpy <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> formation at different temperatures. For this we studied model alanine peptides in which helix formation can be triggered by metal (La 3 +) binding. The heat of La 3 + interaction with the peptides at different temperatures is measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Circular dichroism spectroscopy is used to follow <b>helix</b> formation. Peptides <b>of</b> increasing length (12 -, 16 -, and 19 -aa residues) that contain a La 3 +-binding loop followed by helices of increasing length, are used to separate the heat of metal binding from the enthalpy <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> formation. We demonstrate that (i) the enthalpy <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> formation is − 0. 9 ± 0. 1 kcal/mol; (ii) the enthalpy <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> formation is independent of the peptide length; (iii) the enthalpy <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> formation does not depend significantly on temperature in the range from 5 to 45 °C, suggesting that the heat capacity change on helix formation is very small. Thus, the use of metal binding to induce helix formation has an enormous potential for measuring various thermodynamic properties of α-helices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHalorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis (pHR), a retinylidene {{protein that}} {{functions}} as a light-driven chloride ion pump, is converted into a proton pump {{in the presence of}} azide ion. To clarify this conversion, we investigated light-induced structural changes in pHR using a C 2 crystal that was prepared in the presence of Cl− and subsequently soaked in a solution containing azide ion. When the pHR-azide complex was illuminated at pH 9, a profound outward movement (∼ 4  Å) of the cytoplasmic half <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> F was observed in a subunit with the EF loop facing an open space. This movement created a long water channel between the retinal Schiff base and the cytoplasmic surface, along which a proton could be transported. Meanwhile, the middle moiety <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> C moved inward, leading to shrinkage of the primary anion-binding site (site I), and the azide molecule in site I was expelled out to the extracellular medium. The results suggest that the cytoplasmic half <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> F and the middle moiety <b>of</b> <b>helix</b> C act as different types of valves for active proton transport...|$|R
