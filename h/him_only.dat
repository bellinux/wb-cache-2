Rapp then led the 61stLine Regiment forward when he was wounded (for the 22ndtime in his career).|$|E

5000|$|In the The Mirror of Simple Souls Marguerite Porete {{explained}} the different {{states of the}} soul. She explained: [...] "And therefore this Soul knows <b>only</b> <b>him,</b> and loves <b>only</b> <b>him,</b> praises <b>only</b> <b>him,</b> for there is only he. Because what is exists by his goodness, and God loves his goodness whenever he has bestowed it, and his goodness bestowed is God himself, and God cannot depart from his goodness so that it doesn't dwell in him, thus he is what goodness is and goodness is what God is. And therefore Goodness sees itself by means of his goodness through divine light in the sixth state, by which the Soul is purified." ...|$|R

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 U.S. Championship, Fischer {{experienced}} {{his first}} single-game loss (to Edmar Mednis) in round one. Bisguier was in excellent form, and Fischer {{caught up to}} <b>him</b> <b>only</b> at the end. Tied at 7–3, the two met in the final round. Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing Fischer his fifth consecutive U.S. championship.|$|E

5|$|To {{compound}} {{the agony of}} his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died in late November. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration.

5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with <b>him</b> <b>only</b> 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined <b>him</b> <b>only</b> after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before <b>him,</b> <b>only</b> to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1967, Como began {{reducing}} his TV appearances, gradually becoming {{limited to}} seasonal and holiday specials {{with the emphasis}} being on Christmas. Como had numerous Christmas television specials, beginning on Christmas Eve 1948, and continuing to 1994, when his final Christmas special was recorded in Ireland. They were recorded in many countries, including the Holy Land, Mexico, and Canada, {{as well as many}} locations throughout the United States. The 1987 Christmas special was cancelled at the behest of an angry Como; The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was willing to offer <b>him</b> <b>only</b> a Saturday 10 PM time slot for it three weeks before the holiday. Perry filled the yearly gap for his fans with live Christmas concerts in various locations.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave <b>him</b> <b>only</b> a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
