5|$|At {{the start}} of the 18th century the Luttrells and Dunster Castle faced many {{financial}} challenges. Francis's son Alexander, inherited the castle when he came of age in 1704, but it was still mostly empty and carried large debts with it. Alexander died young in 1711 and his widow, Dorothy, spent almost twenty years paying off the debts. Dorothy built a new chapel, designed by Sir James Thornhill in white Portland stone, on the rear of the mansion at a cost of £1,300 (£178,000 at 2009 prices); few records of this remain, but the interior probably resembled that of the chapel at Wimpole Hall. A safer, <b>if</b> <b>less</b> grand, approach road to the castle was created, called the New Way, and the remains of the Upper Ward on top of the motte were flattened {{to be used as a}} bowling green, complete with an octagonal summer house. Dorothy's son, Alexander Luttrell, took over the castle in 1726 but ran up new debts, and the castle was handed over into the control of a receiver.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, <b>if</b> <b>less</b> so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|E

25|$|It is {{unlikely}} that hominins populated Eurasia after a one-off event getting a few hominins across a strait (such as a Homo erectus family drifting on flood debris and landing on a Eurasian bank). There are biological constraints to the minimum size a population must maintain to avoid extinction. That is to say, <b>if</b> <b>less</b> than 50 hominins at once made it into Eurasia and lost contact with African hominins, the population would likely undergo an extinction vortex, {{in part due to}} inbreeding.|$|E
25|$|For example: In Pennsylvania {{there are}} two rates, basic rate and reissue rate.

These rates and applicable discounts are filed with and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission.|$|E
