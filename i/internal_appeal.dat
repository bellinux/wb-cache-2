25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any <b>internal</b> <b>appeals</b> procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|R

5000|$|A person's {{specific}} {{rights and duties}} depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice. [...] "Exhaustion of administrative remedies" [...] requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then going to a hearing, and finally using the agency's <b>internal</b> <b>appeal</b> process. Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or [...] "exhausted", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court. But the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents parties from seeking relief in the courts first.|$|E

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created, {{among other}} things, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an entity within the U. S. Department of the Treasury tasked with {{assessing}} and mitigating financial risk. Financial institutions with over $ 50 {{billion in assets}} are automatically deemed “systemically important. ” However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, FSOC {{has the authority to}} designate non-bank companies engaged in financial activity as systemically important as well. Once designated as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), these companies are subject to enhanced regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. Because the costs associated with such enhanced regulation are significant, most companies do not actively welcome a SIFI label. In 2016, two of the four non-bank SIFIs (GE Capital and MetLife, Inc.) had their SIFI labels rescinded. GE was able to shed its SIFI label by minimizing the size of its assets and operations. MetLife chose to challenge FSOC’s designation in federal district court. This Note reviews the available methods for challenging SIFI designations and proposes alternative methods to increase fairness in these challenges, including amending FSOC’s evidentiary hearing procedures to more closely resemble federal court proceedings, and creating an <b>internal</b> <b>appeals</b> process within the U.

40|$|The Staff Union 1 of the European Patent Office 2 (SUEPO) {{wishes to}} draw your {{attention}} to the risk associated with the proposed introduction of regulations which limit freedom of association within the EPO. These regulations are {{the latest in a}} series of limitations of staff rights and will further escalate an already heated internal conflict.

The proposed measures engage the responsibility of your country as represented by your delegation to the Administrative Council (AC) of the European Patent Organisation to protect fundamental rights of staff, including the right to strike. If introduced, the measures will result in legal challenges against member states of the EPO for breach of obligations set out under international conventions to enforce such fundamental rights, and will likely draw the attention of a wide range of media.

There is sufficient evidence, for instance, to suggest that public Ombudsmen, despite their shortcomings and need for reform, have the greatest potential to strike this fine balance between PDR and fundamental constitutional values. That said, there are many more issues that should be looked at here, some of which are fundamental, such as the place of ADR in common law and the issue of ADR specifically in public law, while one may still want to be cautious about the divide between public law and private law {{in the context of the}} common law. Finally, there is also an issue of balance to be sought between the use of ADR and the quality of administrative justice...|$|E
40|$|Executive summaryThis {{report is}} {{intended}} to be a practical, useful guide for stakeholders in national and local governments, the media, civil society, and business to making freedom of information laws work. The authors’ particular emphasis is on the role public officials and journalists must play in effectively breathing life into these laws, giving meaning to their democratic intent and legal guarantees. Most of the world’s 90 -plus freedom of information (FOI) laws are recent, enacted in the last two decades, and many are exemplary on paper. But many are also poorly implemented. Surprisingly but commonly, citizens, national and local public officials, and journalists are often unaware that such laws even exist, much less how they work. Non-governmental organizations and businesses typically make more requests than journalists or citizens, but frequently the total number of requests is far below what might be expected given the scope of FOI laws, which in some developing countries apply not only to government agencies but also to private entities that receive government funds. In countries transitioning from authoritarian pasts, governments retain the habit of working in secrecy, which hobbles democracy and promotes corruption. Often when people seek information under FOI laws and are refused, they are denied on grounds that have no basis in law, or, if denied under a statutory exemption, without explanation of why the exemption applies. Sometimes requesters are denied for reasons that amount to official inconvenience, told that the request is too time- or resource-consuming to fulfill, or that the records they want do not exist. Requesters are asked to justify their requests, or officials simply ignore them, thus saving themselves the trouble of providing any explanation. The requester’s opportunity to contest an agency’s denial or failure to respond is typically inadequate: <b>Internal</b> <b>appeals</b> are often met with cursory review and the same result. Ombudsmen or other oversight bodies responsible for monitoring the law rarely have the authority to compel compliance when a request has been improperly denied, and pursuing redress in courts is time-consuming and expensive. Where citizens lack faith in their judicial system, the problem is compounded. This paper begins with a review of the theory and practice of FOI laws, which are universally recognized as critical components of a modern system of free expression. It follows with discussion of the obstacles to effective implementation, including in an appendix several interviews with stakeholders in six countries in which FOI laws have been introduced recently: Albania, Armenia, Indonesia, Jamaica, South Africa, and Ukraine. The paper then makes several recommendations...|$|R
