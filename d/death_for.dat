30|$|For animal illness sensitivity, we again draw on households’ {{explanations}} for livestock mortality. As {{reported in the}} final column of Table  8, of all animal deaths reported, animal disease was cited as the cause for 31 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the left out group, 40 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the moving from group, 21 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the staying with group, and 27 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> the combining group. The staying with group is less exposed to disease transmission relative to the more sedentary groups. We can also pair the relatively low drought loss for the moving from group reported in Table  4 with the relatively high animal disease exposure reported in Table  8 for this group to interpret their smaller herds and lower mobility exposing them differently to animal loss than {{may be the case}} for the other groups.|$|R
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to <b>death</b> <b>for</b> revolutionary activities.|$|E

5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to <b>death</b> <b>for</b> the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century.

A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant <b>death</b> <b>for</b> a breast-fed infant.
