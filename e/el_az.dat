Study group was consisted of 120 dialyzed patients; 57 (age 50, 7 ± 7, 1) were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 73 (age 51, 6 ± 7, 6) were hemodialyzed (HD). Three-dimensional vectorocardiographic (VCG) monitoring was done to assess: QRS-angle, <b>el</b> and <b>az.</b> Echocardiography was performed to assess: Aomax, Aomin, ASI (aortic siffness index). Results. ASI in HD {{as well as in}} CAPD patients was significantly higher compared to controls [resp., 5, 51 (± 1, 32), 5, 83 (± 1, 41), 3, 07 (± 1, 09) ]. Cut-off value of ASI was 5, 67. In HD patients strong correlations between ASI and QRS-angle, <b>el</b> and <b>az</b> were determined (resp., = 0, 429, < 0, 001; = 0, 432, ≤ 0, 001 and = 0, 387, = 0, 001). In CAPD group were significant association between ASI and QRS-angle, <b>el</b> and <b>az</b> (resp., = 0, 452, < 0, 001; = 0, 417, < 0, 001 and = 0, 390, = 0, 001). ASI was independently and markedly associated with: QRS-angle, elev, az, ADMA, cTnT, CRP, Total-chol, LDL-chol in HD and CAPD patients. Conclusions. ASI and VCG indices are higher in HD and CAPD patients. Correlation between ASI and VCG parameters may reflect unfavourable influence of poor aortic compliance on the electrical activity of the heart in dialyzed patients.

The {{creation}} of income {{stability in the}} rural economy is always an important aspiration of agricultural policy. For those that make their living from agriculture, the size and development of producers’ income determines {{the standard of living}} in farming. Comparing the Hungarian rural economy’s income stability indicators with those of other EU countries, {{it can be said that}} the situation of domestic farmers is rather unfavourable. Both the nominal value of income stability and the real value of income have developed unfavourably in the sector. Between 1998 and 2005, real income did not once reach 80 % of the 1998 figure and in fact, in 2003 it was less than 50 % of it. Fundamentally, it is the balance of agricultural output that determines the income stability of agricultural production. Output already includes the effects of price and volume of which the former, that is income development, has the greater influence on stability. Output also includes the advantages and disadvantages stemming from sector diversification. The greater the degree of diversification, the more favourable the stability of the given county’s rural economy. The generally consistent growth in expenditure size has modified nominal income development, for the most part towards stability, while a rate of expansion in excess of output has made real income uncertain. Agricultural policy is, via subsidies, bound to mitigate primarily the unfavourable effects of expenditure. Hungary’s agricultural policy was unable to contribute to increased nominal income stability in the sector, which can primarily be linked to regulatory causes. The realisation of income stability is a common function of producers and of agricultural policy. Increasing the bargaining power of producers’ associations, increasing sector diversification, and agricultural insurance are a few of the tools with which farmers can contribute to income stability. The task of agricultural policy is partly to promote the utilisation of opportunities and partly to increase income levels through development and income supplement subsidies. Regarding the latter, it is a positive step in terms of the future that according to the 2005 Committee Proceedings, income stability can be more or less guaranteed via the new system for divided payments. With the introduction of new, unified payments most producers will be able to count on a reliable basis for planning from 2013. jÃ¶vedelem, stabilitÃ¡s, instabilitÃ¡s, EU, mezÅ‘gazdasÃ¡g, income, stability, instability, EU, rural economy, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Production Economics,...|$|E

40|$|Increasing data {{bandwidth}} requirements from spacecraft systems {{is beginning to}} pressure existing microwave communications systems. Free-Space optical communications allows for larger bandwidths for lower relative power consumption, smaller size and weight {{when compared to the}} microwave equivalent. However optical communication does have a formidable challenge that needs to be overcome before the advantages of the technology can be fully utilized. In order for the communication to be successful the transmitter and receiver terminals need to be pointed with a high accuracy (generally in the order of ≤ 10 µradians) for the duration of communication. In this paper we present a new concept for the precise pointing of optical communications terminals (termed the Precise Pointing Mechanism). In this new concept we combine the separate pointing mechanisms of a conventional optical terminal into a single mechanism, reducing the complexity and cost of the optical bench. This is achieved by electromagnetically actuating the whole telescope assembly in 6 degrees-of-freedom with an angular resolution of less than ± 3 µradians within a 10 (<b>Az.</b> <b>El.)</b> field of view and linear resolution of ± 2 µm.

Within the IMCS, a computer (38) calculates an image registration compensation signal (60) which {{is sent to the}} scan control loops (84, 88, 94, 98) of the onboard cameras (1, 2). At the location external to the spacecraft, the long-term orbital and attitude perturbations on the spacecraft are modeled. Coefficients (K, A) from this model are periodically sent to the onboard computer (38) by means of a command unit (39). The coefficients (K, A) take into account observations of stars and landmarks made by the spacecraft cameras (1, 2) themselves. The computer (38) takes as inputs the updated coefficients (K, A) plus synchronization information indicating the mirror position (<b>AZ,</b> <b>EL)</b> of each of the spacecraft cameras (1, 2), operating mode, and starting and stopping status of the scan lines generated by these cameras (1, 2), and generates in response thereto the image registration compensation signal (60).

Feladatom e lexikai csoport lehető legteljesebb bemutatása, többek közt etimológiai szempontból, s az etimológiákra alapozva a növénynevek áttekintése a lapp nyelvjárások rendszere szempontjából. A több ezer oldalt kitevő szótárakban fellelhető növénynevek kigyűjtése, rendszerezése, eredetvizsgálata mellett az „ismeretlen” eredetű növény-nevek egy részét tudtam etimológiailag megfejteni, és egy lapp–magyar növény-névjegyzéket készítettem <b>el.</b> Emellett <b>az</b> adattáram szócikkeiben még három nyelvű (latin, finn, német) botanikai jelentés-megfeleltetést állítottam össze.

My {{paper is}} about the {{classification}} and etymology {{of the names of}} the plants in Lapland. As I did not have the opportunity to collect on the spot I achived my task by using dictionaries and lists words. The greatest part of the paper, which is a summary of a thesis, is a glossary in which I summarized the names of plants found in the different dictionaries I have studied. According to the similarities of sounds I seperated five main dialect types of Lappish: Southern, Swedish, Norwegian, Inari and Kola-kolta Lappish. I compiled the glossary in alphabetical order. Each of the numbered entries consists of three parts: headword (containing dialect specifications with its places of collecting and meanings in Latin, Hungarian, Finnish and German), etymology and sources. The headword is, possibly the Norwegian Lappish name of the plant followed by the Latin name. If the name of the plant does not exist in Norwegian Lappish, proceeding from the southern dialect towards the North and the East, the first occurance of the word is given as a headword and all the other forms follow. The next part of the entry is in the etymology of the word. Words can be of ancient origin from proto-languages (Proto-Uralic e. g. boska ’angelica plant’; duopma ’bird-cherry’; guossa ’spruce’, Proto-Finno-Ugric e. g. lpKo njormm ’grass in water’; lpI puájui ’willow’, Proto-Finno-Permic e. g. beahci ’pine’, Pro¬to-Finno-Volgaic e. g. suhpi ’aspen’; muorji ’berry’, Baltic-Finnish Early Pre-Finnic e. g. jokηa ’lingonberry’; suoidni ’hay’ and Common Saamic), loan¬words (from old Skandinavian, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Russian, International, Calque), of Lappish origin (compounds, derivation, complementation and allipsis) or of uncertain or unknown origin. In {{the last part of the}} entry a list of literature is given. In the following section there is a map with the names of plants found in most dialects. Similarly, I indicated the names of plants which are interesting, special or characteristic only in Lapland.
