500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E

Among the negative reviews, Janet Maslin from The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Lynch's taste for brain-dead grotesque {{has lost its}} novelty". Fellow Times film critic Vincent Canby concurred, [...] "It's not the worst movie ever made; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be". In his review for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy said, [...] "Laura Palmer, after all the talk, {{is not a very}} interesting or compelling character and long before the climax has become a tiresome teenager". USA Today gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it, [...] "a morbidly joyless affair". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, [...] "though the movie ups the TV ante on nudity, language and violence, Lynch's control falters. But if inspiration is lacking, talent is not. Count Lynch down but never out". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley described the film as a [...] "perversely moving, profoundly self-indulgent prequel".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike Made in the Dark, {{the song}} writing {{approach}} to One Life Stand was {{less of a}} collaborative effort. Only three or four songs were written as a group whilst the rest were written by Goddard and Taylor, though Doyle said [...] "we did have input {{in the way it}} was produced". Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things [...] a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and interlaying a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, there would be the sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody will somehow suddenly explode in your mind. It's never planned, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> happen; almost like it has to." [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] and [...] "Slush" [...] were written by Taylor whilst Goddard wrote [...] "Brothers". Doyle stated that [...] "One Life Stand" [...] and [...] "I Feel Better" [...] were put together [...] "in a slightly more piecemeal way".|$|E

A Zanni also has an animistic view of the world in that he senses a spirit in everything, so it could be eaten. Zanni is ignorant, loutish, and has no self-awareness.

5000|$|.....what we {{concentrated}} on with NeverDead was the graphics, the engine, the destructibility, all the technical side of things. What we didn't have any substantial input into at all were characterisation, script, and large {{elements of the}} way the gameplay rolled out over the game.If you like, the elements I'm particularly proud of because we were involved, were the massive technical achievement to get the destructibility, which some reviewers haven't noticed because it's so seamlessly integrated and so functional. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> work really well, that it's almost a given. If you compare it to the destructibility of other games, it's vastly superior.Having said that, we had Shinta Nojiri embedded here for much more than a year, controlling a lot of the elements of content.
