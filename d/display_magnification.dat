40|$|Twenty {{professional}} pilots {{observed a}} computer-generated airport scene during simulated autopilot-coupled night landing approaches and at two points (20 sec and 10 sec before touchdown) judged whether the airplane would undershoot or overshoot the aimpoint. Visual accommodation was continuously measured using an automatic infrared optometer. Experimental variables included approach slope angle, <b>display</b> <b>magnification,</b> visual focus demand (using ophthalmic lenses), and {{presentation of the}} display as either a real (direct view) or a virtual (collimated) image. Aimpoint judgments shifted predictably with actual approach slope and <b>display</b> <b>magnification.</b> Both pilot judgments and measured accommodation interacted with focus demand with real-image displays but not with virtual-image displays. With either type of display, measured accommodation lagged far behind focus demand and was reliably less responsive to the virtual images. Pilot judgments shifted dramatically from an overwhelming perceived-overshoot bias 20 sec before touchdown to a reliable undershoot bias 10 sec later...|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose in}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the preliminary clinical efficacy of soft-copy reading of digital mammography, for a 15 -mega-sub-pixel (MsP) and a 9 -MsP super-high-resolution liquid-crystal display (SHR-LCD) by use of an independent sub-pixel driving technology. We performed three kinds of phantom observation studies by six radiological technologists. Detectability of a contrast-detail phantom and simulated small objects (SSOs) resembling microcalcifications (MCLs), and shape discrimination ability of SSOs with round and square shapes, were examined and compared with a 5 -MP conventional LCD (5 -MP LCD). In each study, four types of <b>display</b> <b>magnification</b> ratio were used. The detectability and the shape discrimination ability of the 15 -MsP SHR-LCD were highest among the three LCDs of most of the <b>display</b> <b>magnification</b> ratios. The 9 -MsP SHR-LCD indicated a higher or equal performance as compared with the 5 -MP LCD in the SSO detection and shape studies. The results of our study demonstrated that the SHR-LCDs had good potential to detect MCLs and to evaluate the shape in high-resolution digital mammography. © 2009 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics...|$|E
50|$|The screen-door effect (SDE) or fixed-pattern noise (FPN) is {{a visual}} {{artifact}} of displays, where the fine lines separating pixels (or subpixels) become {{visible in the}} displayed image. This {{can be seen in}} digital projector images and regular <b>displays</b> under <b>magnification</b> or at close range, but the increases in display resolutions have made this much less significant. More recently, the screen door effect has been an issue with virtual reality headsets and other head-mounted displays, because these stretch a single display across a much wider field of view.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel FPGA {{implementation of a}} barrel distortion correction algorithm {{with a focus on}} reducing hardware complexity. In order to perform real-time correction in hardware the undistorted output pixels must be produced in raster order. To do this the implementation uses the current scan position in the undistorted image to calculate which pixel in the distorted image to <b>display.</b> The <b>magnification</b> factor needed in this calculation is stored in a special look-up table that reduces the complexity of the hardware design, without significant loss of precision. The application of bilinear interpolation {{to improve the quality of}} the corrected image is also discussed and a real-time approach is presented. This approach uses a novel method of row buffering to compensate for data bandwidth constraints when trying to obtain the required pixels for interpolation...|$|R

40|$|This video {{illustrates}} three distortion-oriented displays as novel ways {{of providing}} awareness of others within groupware. These <b>displays</b> employ <b>magnification</b> lenses and fisheye view techniques to show global context and local detail {{within a single}} window, providing both peripheral and detailed awareness of other participants' presence, location, and actions. The head-up lens uses a transparent interface, showing local detail in the foreground and an overview in the background. The offset lens allows a person to magnify a region of the overview. Finally, the fisheye text viewer displays multiple focal points, one for each participant in the conference. INTRODUCTION Real-time distributed groupware typically provides a shared virtual workspace where people can see and manipulate work artifacts. The problem is that groupware workspaces do not yet afford the richness of interaction available in their physical counterparts. In particular, {{it is difficult to}} maintain a sense of workspace [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Absorbance of {{different}} supernatants {{was measured by}} UV–vis spectrophotometry (Shimadzu Co., Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan; UV- 2450) to evaluate the dispersion stability. The spectral region is 700 to approximately 250 nm. In the experiment, one of the colorimetric wares was enclosed by the supernatant with nanographite as testing sample, {{and the other one}} was enclosed by the supernatant without nanographite as reference sample. The dispersion state of graphite particles in aqueous environment was characterized by SEM (Hitachi High-Tech, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan; S- 4800). SEM images under different <b>magnifications</b> <b>displayed</b> the micromorphology of graphite emulsion.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe explore two methods for real-time generation of more realistic two and three-dimensional terrain displays than what are currently available on relatively inexpensive graphics workstations. The first method involves using a high-resolution terrain elevation database. The second method involves coloring and shading the terrain with gray-scale {{data obtained from}} associated aerial photography. Both methods were implemented with a three-dimensional simulator utilizing a high resolution digital terrain database that was generated from processed F- 14 stereo imagery. We describe our simulator, the High-Resolution Digital Terrain Model (HRDTM), listing its capabilities and graphics features. We also present how the system performs on a high-performance graphics workstation. The High Resolution Digital Terrain Model simulator was developed {{as part of a}} joint master of science degree thesis for Captain William O Breden, USMC and Captain James J. Zanoli, USA. Captain Breden was responsible for database manipulation, the user interface, the two and three-dimensional terrain <b>display,</b> the <b>magnification</b> capability, the variable gamma ramp capability. and the camera (laser printing) capability. Captain Zanoli was responsible for file input/output, elevation contour map and aerial photo display, initial three-dimensional terrain display, and data panel performance measurements.

40|$|Cyclic {{volatile}} methylsiloxanes (cVMS) {{are used}} in personal care products and emitted to aquatic environments through wastewater effluents, and their bioaccumulation potential is debated. Here, a new bentho-pelagic version of the ACC-HUMAN model was evaluated for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and applied to cVMS in combination with measurements to explore their bioaccumulation behavior in a subarctic lake. Predictions agreed better with measured PCB concentrations in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) when the benthic link was included than in the pelagic-only model. Measured concentrations of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) were 60 ± 1. 2 (Chironomidae larvae), 107 ± 4. 5 (pea clams Pisidium sp.), 131 ± 105 (three-spined sticklebacks: Gasterosteus aculeatus), 41 ± 38 (char), and 9. 9 ± 5. 9 (trout) ng g- 1 wet weight. Concentrations were lower for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6), {{and none of the}} cVMS <b>displayed</b> trophic <b>magnification.</b> Predicted cVMS concentrations were lower than measured in benthos, but agreed well with measurements in fish. cVMS removal through ventilation was an important predicted loss mechanism for the benthic-feeding fish. Predictions were highly sensitive to the partition coefficient between organic carbon and water (KOC) and its temperature dependence, as this controlled bioavailability for benthos (the main source of cVMS for fish) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Screen {{magnification}} is {{an important}} means to support visually impaired people when working with computers. Many improvements have been made on appropriate software. But unfortunately, in the last years, those improvements where mainly in realization detail. A number of problems remain, that, to our minds, need conceptual rethinking. In this paper, we present a new concept for magnification software. It uses different views to support the user efficiently in different situations. Thereby, it reveals the possibility to build upon current magnification methods and so retain features of current magnification software. The described views are derived from a concept that was originally developed for a tactile graphics display. We found that both topics, rendering for a tactile graphics <b>display</b> and screen <b>magnification,</b> have very much in common. Initial user feedback confirms {{the usefulness of the}} concept...|$|R
40|$|Desktop {{conferencing}} {{systems are}} now {{moving away from}} strict view-sharing and towards relaxed "what-you-see-iswhat -I-see" (relaxed-WYSIWIS) interfaces, where distributed participants in a real time session can view different parts of a shared visual workspace. As with strict view-sharing, people using relaxed-WYSIWIS require a sense of workspace awareness [...] -the up-to-the-minute knowledge about another person's interactions with the shared workspace. The problem is deciding how to provide a user with an appropriate level of awareness of what other participants are doing when they are working in {{different areas of the}} workspace. In this paper, we propose distortion oriented displays as a novel way of providing this awareness. These <b>displays,</b> which employ <b>magnification</b> lenses and fisheye view techniques, show global context and local detail within a single window, providing both peripheral and detailed awareness of other participants' actions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 10 - 11) This {{study examined}} drivers’ perceptions of distance to a rearward vehicle while using a camera-based rear vision system in actual driving conditions. Participants drove an instrumented car equipped with conventional rearview mirrors {{and with a}} camera rear vision system. Using various configurations of these rear vision systems, they observed the approach of an overtaking car and indicated the last moment at which it would be safe to initiate a lane-change maneuver in front of it. Their judgments were strongly affected {{by the type of}} display used to observe the overtaking car. The longest distances were obtained with the camera-based <b>display</b> at unit <b>magnification.</b> Distances were substantially shorter with the conventional mirror and with the camera-based display at 0. 5 magnification. These results are consistent with results from an earlier study conducted under static conditions...|$|R
40|$|The elastodynamic image forces {{acting on}} {{straight}} screw dislocations {{in the presence}} of planar phase boundaries are derived. Two separate dislocations are studied: (i) the injected, non-moving screw dislocation and (ii) the injected (or pre-existing), generally non-uniformly moving screw dislocation. The image forces are derived for both the case of a rigid surface and of a planar interface between two homogeneous, isotropic phases. The case of a rigid interface is shown to be solvable employing Head's image dislocation construction. The case of the elastodynamic image force due to an interface is solved by deriving the reflected wave's contribution to the global solution across the interface. This entails obtaining the fundamental solution (Green's function) for a point unit force via Cagniard's method, and then applying the convolution theorem for a screw dislocation modelled as a force distribution. Complete, explicit formulae are provided when available. It is shown that the elastodynamic image forces are generally affected by retardation effects, and that those acting on the moving dislocations <b>display</b> a dynamic <b>magnification</b> that exceed the attraction (or repulsion) predicted in classical elastostatic calculations.
