This difference may be because the distribution of mAChR on the endothelium varies with the type of vessel. This paper examines the distribution of mAChR on the vascular endothelium along intraparenchymal blood vessels in the rat brain by <b>immunolabelling</b> and laser confocal microscopy. Sections were immunostained by combinations of an anti-mAChR antibody (M 35) with antibodies to endothelial (anti-GLUT 1), or to smooth muscle markers (anti-actin).

Most of the penetrating vessels bore mAChR <b>immunolabelling</b> which coincided over almost all the vessel surface with endothelial labelling. The mAChR <b>immunolabelling</b> was less widespread over the endothelium on the medium sized vessels (diameter < 50 microm) and only 50 % of these vessels had mAChR staining on the endothelium. There was no mAChR immunostaining on the endothelium of the capillaries.

In control muscles, despite mild glycogen depletion and a mild reduction in protein synthetic rate in the central portion of the muscle, fibres throughout the muscle appear to be viable with normal cytoskeletal and contractile protein architecture, normal concentrations of high energy phosphates and no creatine kinase efflux. Dinitrophenol causes rapid creatine kinase efflux, extensive loss of <b>immunolabelling</b> for desmin and dystrophin, and abnormal myosin <b>immunolabelling.</b> Creatine kinase efflux and the changes in desmin and dystrophin are reduced by the exclusion of calcium.

In the present study we investigated the expression levels of Egr- 1 protein in early stages of human bladder cancer and correlated it to later progression. Methods Expression of Egr- 1 protein in human bladder cancer was examined by immunohistochemistry, on a tissue microarray constructed from tumors from 289 patients with non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer. Results The frequency of tumor cells with nuclear Egr- 1 <b>immunolabelling</b> correlated to bladder cancer stage, grade and to later progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T 2 - 4). Stage T 1 tumors exhibited significantly higher frequencies of tumor cells with nuclear Egr- 1 <b>immunolabelling</b> than Ta tumors (P = 0. 001). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high frequency of tumor cells with nuclear Egr- 1 <b>immunolabelling</b> was significantly associated with a higher risk of progression to stage T 2 - 4 (log-rank test, P = 0. 035).

40|$|A {{method for}} {{sequential}} protein A-gold <b>immunolabeling</b> is described whereby the binding of second gold probe {{to the first}} antibody-protein A-gold complex is reduced to acceptably minimal levels. <b>Immunolabeling</b> of thin sections of embedded pituitary tissue {{was used as a}} model system. After an initial <b>immunolabeling</b> for prolactin, sections were incubated in normal serum (rabbit) followed by a monovalent fragment of protein A. These latter two incubations reduced artifactual second gold probe label over prolactin-labeled secretory granules to minimal levels (much less than 1 particle per granule) when sections were subsequently <b>immunolabeled</b> with normal serum. The combination of normal serum and protein A fragment incubations saturates IgG and protein A binding sites on the first antibody-gold probe complex. The latter is thereafter unable to bind further IgG (and thus gold probe) because of the monovalent nature of the protein A fragment.

40|$|PURPOSE. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the association between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and glaucoma based on the known synergism between oxidative stress with AGEs and the evidence of oxidative stress during glaucomatous neurodegeneration. METHODS. The extent and cellular localization of <b>immunolabeling</b> for AGEs and their receptor, RAGE, were determined in histologic sections of the retina and optic nerve head obtained from 38 donor eyes with glaucoma and 30 eyes from agematched donors without glaucoma. RESULTS. The extent of AGE and RAGE <b>immunolabeling</b> was greater in older than in younger donor eyes. However, compared with age-matched controls, an enhanced accumulation of AGEs and an up-regulation of RAGE were detectable in the glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head. Although some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and glia exhibited intracellular <b>immunolabeling</b> for AGEs, increased AGE <b>immunolabeling</b> in glaucomatous eyes was predominantly extracellular and included laminar cribriform plates in the optic nerve head. Some RAGE <b>immunolabeling</b> was detectable on RGCs; however, increased RAGE <b>immunolabeling</b> in glaucomatous eyes was predominant on glial cells, primarily Müller cells. CONCLUSIONS. Given that the generation of AGEs is an agedependent event, increased AGE accumulation in glaucomatous tissues supports that an accelerated aging process accompanies neurodegeneration in glaucomatous eyes. One of the potential consequences of AGE accumulation in glaucomatous eyes appears to be its contribution to increased rigidity of the lamina cribrosa. The presence of RAGE on RGCs and glia also makes them susceptible to AGE-mediated events through receptor-mediated signaling, which may promote cell death or dysfunction during glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
