25|$|Dr. Robert Bea, {{chair of}} an {{independent}} levee investigation team, {{has said that the}} New Orleans-based design firm Modjeski and Masters could have followed correct procedures in calculating safety factors for the flood walls. He added, however, that design procedures of the Corps may not account for changes in soil strength caused by the changes in water flow and pressure during a hurricane flood. Dr. Bea has also questioned the size of the <b>design</b> <b>safety</b> margins. He said the corps applied a 30%margin over the maximum design load. A doubling of strength would be a more typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures. There were also indications that substandard concrete may have been used at the 17th Street Canal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytic}} {{evaluation of the}} Safe Control Systems (SaCS) pattern language for the develop-ment of conceptual <b>safety</b> <b>designs.</b> By a conceptual <b>safety</b> <b>design</b> we mean an early stage specification of system requirements, system <b>design,</b> and <b>safety</b> case for a safety critical system. The SaCS pattern language may express basic patterns on different aspects of relevance for conceptual <b>safety</b> <b>designs.</b> SaCS may {{also be used to}} combine basic patterns into composite patterns. A composite pattern may be instantiated into a conceptual <b>safety</b> <b>design.</b> A framework for evaluating modelling languages is used to conduct the evaluation. The quality of a language is within the framework expressed by six appropriateness factors. A set of requirements is associated with each appropriateness factor. The extent to which these requirements are fulfilled are used to judge the quality. We discuss the fulfilment of the requirements formulated for the SaCS language {{on the basis of the}} theoretical, technical, and practical considerations that were taken into account and shaped the SaCS language.
