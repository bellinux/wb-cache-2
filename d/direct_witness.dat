5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both <b>direct</b> <b>witness)</b> he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate. He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it {{was the only one that}} included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E
2500|$|... 52 is small, and {{although}} a plausible reconstruction can be attempted {{for most of}} the fourteen lines represented, the proportion of the text of the Gospel of John for which it provides a <b>direct</b> <b>witness</b> is necessarily limited, so it is rarely cited in textual debate. There has, however, been some contention as to whether the name ΙΗΣΟΥ (Jesus) in the 'missing' portions of recto lines 2 and 5 was originally written as nomen sacrum; in other words, was it contracted to ΙΣ or ΙΗΣ in accordance with otherwise universal Christian practice in surviving early Gospel manuscripts. Roberts originally considered that the divine name was {{more likely to have been}} written in full, but later changed his mind. This latter is also the view of Larry W. Hurtado; with C. M. Tuckett maintaining Roberts' original opinion. The verses included in 52 are also witnessed in Bodmer Papyrus 66 [...] usually dated to the beginning of the 3rd century CE [...] there is also some overlap with 60 and 90 of the 7th and 2nd centuries respectively. No two of the four contain the same exact text as reconstructed for John 18:31-38, but 52 seems to represent an example of the same proto-Alexandrian text-type. Aland described it as a [...] "Normal text", and placed it in Category I (because of its age).|$|E
60|$|But if {{the medical}} man bears witness for God and spiritual things when he seems {{exclusively}} occupied with the body, {{so does the}} hospital. Look at those noble buildings which the generosity of our fellow-countrymen have erected in all our great cities. You may find in them, truly, sermons in stones; sermons for rich alike and poor. They preach to the rich, these hospitals, that the sick-bed levels all alike; {{that they are the}} equals and brothers of the poor in the terrible liability to suffer! They preach to the poor that they are, through Christianity, the equals of the rich in their means and opportunities of cure. I say through Christianity. Whether the founders so intended or not (and those who founded most of them, St. George's among the rest, did so intend), these hospitals bear <b>direct</b> <b>witness</b> for Christ. They do this, and would do it, even if--which God forbid--the name of Christ were never mentioned within their walls. That may seem a paradox; but it is none. For it is a historic fact, that hospitals are a creation of Christian times, and of Christian men. The heathen knew them not. In that great city of ancient Rome, as far as I have ever been able to discover, {{there was not a single}} hospital,--not even, I fear, a single charitable institution. Fearful thought--a city of a million and a half inhabitants, the centre of human civilization: and not a hospital there! The Roman Dives paid his physician; the Roman Lazarus literally lay at his gate full of sores, till he died the death of the street dogs which licked those sores, and was carried forth to be thrust under ground awhile, till the same dogs came to quarrel over his bones. The misery and helplessness of the lower classes in the great cities of the Roman empire, till the Church of Christ arose, literally with healing in its wings, cannot, I believe, be exaggerated.|$|E

To account for this use, I introduce a notion of centered situations, combining situations {{in the sense of}} Kratzer 1989 with centered worlds in the sense of Lewis 1979 and others. I propose that, on their vivid uses, these predicates make reference to a (real or possible) centered situation.
