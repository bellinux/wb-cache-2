40|$|Cyclists seek to {{maximize}} performance duringcompetition, and gross efficiency {{is an important}} factor affectingperformance. Gross efficiency is itself affected by pedal rate. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} factors that affect freely chosen pedal rate. Crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> varies greatly during road cycling based on the selected gear ratio. Nevertheless, the possible influence of crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> on freely chosen pedal rate and gross efficiency has never been investigated. This study tested the hypotheses that during cycling with sub-maximal work rates, a considerable increase in crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> would cause (1) freely chosen pedal rate to increase, and as a consequence, (2) gross efficiency to decrease. Furthermore, that it would cause (3) peak crank torque to increase if a constant pedal rate was maintained. Subjects cycled on a treadmill at 150 and 250 W, with low and high crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load,</b> and with preset and freely chosen pedal rate. Freely chosen pedal rate was higher at high compared with low crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load.</b> Notably, the change in crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> affected the freely chosen pedal rate as much as did the 100 W increase in work rate. Alongwith freely chosen pedal rate being higher, gross efficiency at 250 W was lower during cycling with high compared with low crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load.</b> Peak crank torque was higher during cycling at 90 rpm with high compared with low crank <b>inertial</b> <b>load.</b> Possibly, the subjects increased the pedal rate to compensate for the higher peak crank torque accompanying cycling with high compared with low crank inertia...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{of fatigue}} failure {{exists in the}} tube trailer {{cylinders}} under the condition of internal pressure variation and <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> caused through road transport. In order to estimate the safety state of the cylinders under the action of alternating load, the model of certain geometry sizes {{is built based on}} the widely used tube trailer cylinders. The fatigue analysis of tube trailer gas cylinders is made aiming at the action of the internal pressure and the <b>inertial</b> <b>load.</b> The fatigue life distribution of cylinders is obtained under the condition of different loads through the numerical simulation by ANSYS Workbench. The analysis results show that under internal pressure, gas cylinders have limited fatigue life, but can satisfy the requirements; when the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> exceeds a certain value, natural gas cylinders of tube trailer is under finite life state, which does not meet the requirements of strength, therefore the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> should be controlled...|$|R
40|$|When {{a muscle}} {{delivers}} power to an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> through a spring, the peak power can exceed the maximum that the muscle alone could produce. Using normalized differential equations relating dimensionless quantities we show, by solving the equations either analytically or numerically, that one dimensionless constant (Xi), representing the <b>inertial</b> <b>load,</b> {{is sufficient to}} specify the behaviour during shortening of a muscle-tendon complex with linear force-velocity and force-extension properties. In the presence of gravity, an additional constant (Gamma), representing the gravitational acceleration, is required. Nonlinear force-velocity and force-extension relationships each introduce an additional constant, representing their curvature. In the absence of gravity the power output delivered to an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> is limited to approximately 1. 4 times the maximum power of the muscle alone, and when gravity is present the power delivered is limited to approximately twice the power of muscle alone. These limits are found for the purely <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> at Xi ca. 1 and with gravity acting at XiGamma = 0. 5 with Xi arbitrarily small. The effects of nonlinear muscle and tendon properties tend to {{cancel each other out}} and do not produce large deviations from these optima. A lever system of constant ratio between muscle and load does not alter these limits. Cams and catches are required to exceed these limits and attain the high power outputs sometimes observed during explosive animal movement...|$|R
50|$|Bracing wires {{primarily}} {{divide into}} flying wires which hold the wings down when flying and landing wires which hold the wings {{up when they}} are not generating lift. (The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown.|$|E
50|$|Aviation {{engineering}} and aerospace engineering {{have been the}} main driving force in developing modern active structures. Aircraft (and spacecraft) require adaptation because {{they are exposed to}} many different environments, and therefore loadings, during their lifetime. Prior to launching they are subjected to gravity or dead loads, duringtakeoff they are subjected to extreme dynamic and <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> and in-flight they need to be in a configuration which minimizes drag but promotes lift. A lot of effort has been committed into adaptive aircraft wings to produce one that can control the separation of boundary layers and turbulence. Many space structures utilize adaptivity to survive extreme environmental challenges in space or to achieve precise accuracies. For example, space antennas and mirrors can be activated to precise orientation. As space technology advances, some sensitive equipment (namely interferometric optical and infrared astronomical instruments) are required to be accurate in position as delicate as a few nanometres, while the supporting active structure is tens of metres in dimensions.|$|E
50|$|Strain wave gearing {{also known}} as Harmonic Drive is a special type of {{mechanical}} gear system that can improve certain characteristics compared to traditional gearing systems such as helical gears or planetary gears. It was invented in 1957 by C.W. Musser {{while he was a}} research advisor at United Shoe Machinery (USM). The advantages include: no backlash, compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability when repositioning <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts. High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).Disadvantages include a tendency for 'wind-up' (a torsional spring rate) in the low torque region. Strain wave gears are typically used in industrial motion control, machine tool, printing machine, robotics and aerospace, for gear reduction but may also be used to increase rotational speed, or for differential gearing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} inertial forces into the proposed integrated layout optimization method designing the multi-component systems. Considering a complex packing system for which several components will be placed in a container of specific shape, the aim of the design procedure is to find the optimal location and orientation of each component, as well as the configuration of the structure that supports and interconnects the components. On the one hand, the Finite-circle Method (FCM) is used to avoid the components overlaps, and also overlaps between components and the design domain boundaries. One the other hand, the optimal material layout of the supporting structure in the design domain is designed by topology optimization. A consistent material interpolation scheme between element stiffness and <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> is presented to avoid the singularity of localized deformation due to the presence of design dependent <b>inertial</b> <b>loading</b> when the element stiffness and the involved <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> are weakened with the element material removal. The tested numerical example shows the proposed methods extend the actual concept of topology optimization and are efficient to generate reasonable design patterns...|$|R
50|$|In {{agricultural}} equipment an overrunning clutch is typically used on hay balers {{and other equipment}} with a high <b>inertial</b> <b>load,</b> particularly when {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor without a live power take-off (PTO). Without a live PTO, a high <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> can cause the tractor to continue to move forward even when the foot clutch is depressed, creating an unsafe condition. By disconnecting the load from the PTO under these conditions, the overrunning clutch improves safety. Similarly, many unpowered 'push' cylinder lawnmowers use a freewheel to drive the blades: these are geared or chain-driven to rotate at high speed and the freewheel prevents their momentum being transferred in the reverse direction through the drive when the machine is halted.|$|R
40|$|Project Yo-Yo is a {{collaborative}} effort between BSU’s Mechanical Engineering Senior Design class of 2012, Eric Dugan, PhD, and Seth Kuhlman, PE. The development and validation of a fully functioning dynamically <b>loaded,</b> <b>inertial,</b> strength training and rehabilitation device was requested. The YoYo system integrates a multitude of exercises in one condensed design providing a versatile operational unit free from gravitational forces. An algorithm controlled by user input automatically adjusts the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> of the system to maintain a specified power output. The algorithm controls the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> by dynamically adjusting the radial position of rotating masses. Additionally, a retract mechanism was developed to {{eliminate the need for}} user specific anthropometric adjustments of the device and to ensure constant tension on the cables eliminating jerk on the user.

50|$|Series wound {{electric}} motors respond to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises {{in proportion to}} the square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, and there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. The counter-EMF aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant, the counter-EMF is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is low; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the stall torque and the no-load speed. This suits large <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high stalling torque.|$|E
50|$|In {{pulse-width}} modulation the switches {{are turned}} on {{at a constant}} chopping frequency. The total time period of one cycle of output waveform is constant. The average output voltage is directly proportional to the ON time of chopper. The ratio of ON time to total time is defined as duty cycle. It can be varied between 0 and 1 or between 0 and 100%. Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM), is a technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal. Although this modulation technique {{can be used to}} encode information for transmission, its main use is to allow the control of the power supplied to electrical devices, especially to <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> such as motors. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect the load (the device that uses the power), {{which is to say that}} the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. Typically switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove, 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer, from few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.|$|E
50|$|The 7 post shaker places {{forces on}} a vehicle and records {{the forces that}} the vehicle puts back into the system. The 7 post applies lift, downforce, road {{irregularity}} forces and load transfer due to braking, acceleration and cornering. The vehicle suspension and drivetrain components respond to these forces, chassis and suspension frequency oscillations (under 30 Hz), and tire, engine, transmission and drive axle vibrations at higher frequencies. The forces applied are calculated from {{a model of the}} racetrack, the weight of the car and driver, tire pressure, engine RPM, and driveline RPM. The forces that the testing engineers want are placed on the car through the use of four main hydraulic actuators capable of generating 25 kN of force with a maximum velocity in excess of 1 m/s that act on the tires. While the actuators are capable of producing frequencies as high as 500 Hz, this is not necessary as the elasticity of the rubber and air in the tires will absorb most inputs above 50 Hz. The remaining three posts are known as aeroloader actuators, and are responsible for the sprung mass of the vehicle. The forces that these three actuators represent are <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> that come from entering a curve or aerodynamic loading and unloading in the form of downforce or lift from a wing. These forces are small on road cars where speeds are not normally greater than 140 km/h, but are significant on a race car where speeds can exceed 300 km/h.|$|E

Combined-Load resulted in lower error (6. 89 ± 3. 25 %) compared to Inertia-Only (8. 40 ± 4. 32 %) and Viscosity-Only (8. 17 ± 4. 13 %) according to radial deviation analysis (% of trial mean radius). An analysis of sensitivity to load variation in normal and catch trials reveals performance differences were likely due to changes in feedforward mass compensation. Analysis of exploration movement revealed higher average speeds (12. 0 %) and endpoint forces (22. 9 %) with Combined-Load exploration compared to Inertia-Only.

The relationship between peak power and inertial load showed a parabolic-like relationship for mNPR exertions, with a peak [937 (SD 246) W] at 0. 158 kg m(2), this being significantly (P < 0. 05) different from the power generated at both the lowest [723 (162) W] and highest [756 (206) W] <b>inertial</b> <b>loads.</b> In contrast, for cycling exercise power output {{did not differ significantly}} between <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> except at the lowest inertia where power output was significantly (P< 0. 05) less compared with all other <b>inertial</b> <b>loads.</b> Maximum peak power output during cycling was 1, 620 (336) W, which was significantly (P < 0. 05) greater than that recorded on the mNPR. However, a close association was observed between the mean power generated by each method (r= 0. 84, P< 0. 05).

40|$|In this experiment, we {{investigated}} whether the Central Nervous System uses internal forward models of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> {{to maintain the}} stability of a precision grip when manipulating objects {{in the absence of}} gravity. The micro-gravity condition causes profound changes in the profile of tangential constraints at the finger-object interface. In order to assess the ability to predict the micro-gravity-specific variation of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> we analyzed the grip force adjustments that occurred when naïve subjects held an object in a precision grip and performed point-to-point movements under the weightless condition induced by parabolic flight. Such movements typically presented static and dynamic phases, which permitted distinction between a static component of the grip force (measured before the movement) and a dynamic component of the grip force (measured during the movement). The static component tended to gradually decrease across the parabolas, whereas the dynamic component was rapidly modulated with the micro-gravity-specific <b>inertial</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, the amplitude of the modulation significantly correlated with the amplitude of the tangential constraints for the dynamic component. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the internal representation of arm and object dynamics adapts to new gravitational contexts. In addition, the difference in timescales of adaptation of static and dynamic components suggests that they can be processed independently. The prediction of self-induced variation of <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> permits fine modulation of grip force, which ensures a stable grip during manipulation of an object in a new environment...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{applications}} increasingly require actuators {{that offer}} a combination of high force output, large stroke and high accuracy. The ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA) was designed by Drs. Habibi and Goldenberg originally as a high-performance actuator for use in robotics. However, {{it was determined that}} the EHA had the potential to achieve high positional accuracy. Little research has been performed in the area of high-accuracy hydraulic positioning systems. Therefore, the objective of this study to achieve nano-scale positional accuracy with the EHA while maintaining large stroke and high force output. It was planned to achieve this objective through modification of the prototype EHA and the use of fuzzy control. During this research project, both hardware and control system modifications to the EHA were performed. A high-precision optical encoder position sensor with a 50 nm resolution was mounted on the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> to directly measure the position of the load. A number of device drivers were written to interface the MATLAB real-time control environment with the optical encoder and servo motor amplifier. A Sugeno-inference fuzzy controller was designed and implemented in MATLAB. For comparison purposes, a switched-gain controller and a proportional controller were also implemented in the control environment. The performance of the fuzzy controller was compared to the switched-gain controller and the proportional controller in a number of tests. First, the regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> of 20 kg was examined. It was determined in the regulatory tests that the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was excellent, achieving a steady state error of 50 ± 25 nm or less for step inputs in the range 5 cm to 200 nm. The positional accuracy during the tracking tests was found to be reduced compared to the regulatory tests since the actuator did not have sufficient time to settle to final accuracy due to the timevarying input signals. In all cases, {{it was found that the}} positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers for both regulatory and tracking signals. Testing with the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> eliminated or changed was not performed because the position sensor was mounted to the load, making it unfeasible to alter the load during the time frame of this study. The regulatory and tracking performance of the EHA with an <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> of 20 kg plus external resistive loads of 90 to 280 N were investigated. It was found that the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased with the application of an external load to 3. 10 ± 0. 835 µm for a 1 cm step input (90 N load) and 8. 45 ± 0. 400 µm for a 3 cm step input (280 N load). Again, the positional accuracy of the EHA decreased during the tracking tests relative to the regulatory tests, for the reason stated above. This implies that the positional accuracy of the EHA with a resistive load is in the microscale, rather than the nano-scale as was put forth as the objective of this study. Nevertheless, the positional accuracy of the EHA with the fuzzy controller was found to be significantly greater than with the switched-gain and proportional controllers. It is postulated that the increase in positional error observed during the external load tests was due to an increase in cross-port leakage, relative to the <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> tests, caused by the pressure differential induced across the actuator by the external load. Methods of reducing the increase in positional error caused by external loads on the EHA remains an area for future study...|$|R

40|$|Dragonfly {{wings are}} highly corrugated, which {{increases}} the stiffness and strength of the wing significantly, and results in a lightweight structure with good aerodynamic performance. How insect wings carry aerodynamic and <b>inertial</b> <b>loads,</b> and how the resonant frequency of the flapping wings is tuned for carrying these loads, is however not fully understood. To study this we made a three-dimensional scan of a dragonfly (Sympetrum vulgatum) fore- and hindwing with a micro-CT scanner. The scans contain the complete venation pattern including thickness variations throughout both wings. We subsequently approximated the forewing architecture with an efficient three-dimensional beam and shell model. We then determined the wing’s natural vibration modes and the wing deformation resulting from analytical estimates of 8 load cases containing aerodynamic and <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> (using the finite element solver Abaqus). Based on our computations {{we find that the}} <b>inertial</b> <b>loads</b> are 1. 5 to 3 times higher than aerodynamic pressure loads. We further find that wing deformation is smaller during the downstroke than during the upstroke, due to structural asymmetry. The natural vibration mode analysis revealed that the structural natural frequency of a dragonfly wing in vacuum is 154 Hz, which is approximately 4. 8 times higher than the natural flapping frequency of dragonflies in hovering flight (32. 3 Hz). This insight in the structural properties of dragonfly wings could inspire the design of more effective wings for insect-sized flapping micro air vehicles: The passive shape of aeroelastically tailored wings inspired by dragonflies can in principle be designed more precisely compared to sail like wings —which can make the dragonfly-like wings more aerodynamically effective...|$|E

In this paper, the equivalent static load of the large span roofs is formulated in terms of either a weighted combination of modal <b>inertial</b> <b>load</b> components, and the resonant and background load components that was obtained by the POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) and LRC (Load –Response-Correlation) techniques...|$|R
