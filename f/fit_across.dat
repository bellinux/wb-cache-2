500|$|Industries {{associated}} with the sea developed throughout the East End, including rope making and shipbuilding. The former location of roperies can still be identified from their long straight, narrow profile in the modern streets, for instance Ropery Street near Mile End. Shipbuilding was important from the time when Henry VIII caused ships to be built at Rotherhithe {{as a part of}} his expansion of the Royal Navy. On 31 January 1858, the largest ship of that time, the SS Great Eastern, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott Russell & Co, of Millwall. The [...] vessel was too long to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the river, and so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, after this, shipbuilding on the Thames went into a long decline. Ships continued to be built at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at Blackwall and Canning Town until the yard closed in 1913, shortly after the launch of the Dreadnought Battleship HMS Thunderer (1911).|$|E
2500|$|The other Sutton proposal, to Tooting, is {{more ambitious}} and {{contains}} many more challenges than Sutton/Wimbledon link. Apart from workshop/depot facilities and a curve required {{to link the}} line into the existing system, this extension would share no infrastructure with it. If [...] "line 4" [...] is realised ahead of this proposal, the Tooting line would have the St Helier to Sutton section in common. North of St Helier, the alignment is likely to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> parkland and open space {{to take in the}} Willow Lane Industrial Estate before serving Mitcham town centre. There would be some commonality here with the short separate proposal for a spur from Mitcham Junction to Mitcham town centre. From here, the extension would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre before sharing the carriageway with all traffic in London Road south of Figge’s Marsh, with room for segregation beyond the junction with Streatham Road. The most difficult leg arises immediately the Merton/Wandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching Tooting Broadway from this point will stir much debate.|$|E

50|$|For the 1968 {{model year}} the D14/4 was introduced, {{similar to the}} D10 but with greater power again and the 4 speed gearbox <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the range. The Sports and Bushman models also gained heavier front forks.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{flooring}} of thin planking for 3 1/2 feet of {{the central}} portion of the boat must now be made as follows:--Make five planks, between 8 and 9 inches wide, to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the beam of the boat, and {{in each of the}} outer planks, o o, p p, fig. III., fix uprights m n, 6 inches high, to support a seat, mortised on the pair of uprights in each board; the ends of each seat should be short of the breadth of the boat by an inch or so, so as not to bear against the sides; then lay down two ribs of tough wood, fitted to bear equally across the planking, on each side, as rs, r1 s1, and screw each end of them down to the outer planks only.|$|E
50|$|The getaway bridge, {{which was}} capable of holding 12 canisters, made its maiden flight on STS-61-C. The {{aluminum}} bridge <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the payload bay of the orbiter and offered a convenient and economic way of flying several GAS canisters.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, the VDC {{program is}} not {{standard}} <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the Saga range. The entry-level Saga Standard does not offer any VDC components. The mid-range Saga Executive adds on ABS, EBD and BA. The range-topping Saga Premium is the only variant to receive ESC, TCS and HHA.|$|E
50|$|Quadtrees are a {{specialised}} form of grid {{in which}} {{the resolution of the}} grid is varied according to the nature and/or complexity of the data to be <b>fitted,</b> <b>across</b> the 2-d space, and are considered separately under that heading.|$|R
5000|$|However, most baggage {{and loose}} freight items are loaded into {{containers}} called Unit Load Devices (ULDs), {{often referred to}} as [...] "cans". ULDs {{come in a variety of}} sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the LD3. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and <b>fits</b> <b>across</b> half of its width.|$|R
2500|$|A later {{development}} saw Class 86/2 and 86/4 locomotives {{fitted with}} TDM {{to enable them}} to operate push-pull passenger trains, to avoid having to run the locomotive round a train at a terminus (see DBSO, DVT). [...] The 86/4s were already fitted with an older multiple-working system and this was gradually phased out after TDM was <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the fleet.|$|R

50|$|Stationery {{cabinets}} {{come with}} three, four, or five steel shelves which {{are designed to}} <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> {{the width of the}} cabinet, fitted into brackets in the internal walls, and the position of these can be changed in small increments, thus allowing users to adjust the height of the shelves to their particular needs.|$|E
50|$|This {{style of}} body was {{designed}} to accommodate the high volume low weight loads of straw hats which were part of Luton's industry. Straw hats were wrapped in hessian in long cylinders to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> {{the width of the}} van. It was incidental that it was the home of Bedford although all the early Luton vans were on Bedford chassis.|$|E
50|$|A caliper is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the {{distance}} between two opposite sides of an object. A caliper {{can be as simple as}} a compass with inward or outward-facing points. The tips of the caliper are adjusted to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the points to be measured, the caliper is then removed and the distance read by measuring between the tips with a measuring tool, such as a ruler.|$|E
50|$|The {{background}} artwork {{for each}} card was an outer space scene which <b>fitted</b> together <b>across</b> adjacent cards.|$|R
40|$|The shear {{press is}} an {{instrument}} for measuring food texture (Kramer, Burkhardt &Rogers, 1951). The original model was introduced in 1950 and it was later modified for electrical indicating and recording (Decker et al., 1957). A new more versatile and precise model was introduced in 1956 (Kramer & Twigg, 1958). In this instrument force is measured by a maximum-reading dial gauge <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the vertical diameter of a proving ring. If time-force texture graphs are required, a transducer can be <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the ring {{in place of the}} dial gauge to give a print-out on a strip chart as the sample is tested. This note reports an alternative and relatively cheap system for converting a dial reading shear press to a recording model. Strain gauges are attached to the proving ring and the electrical output is amplified and is recorded on a strip chart {{in the form of a}} texturegram. The dial gauge remains in place to indicate maximum deflection. The system is simple and easy to construct...|$|R

5000|$|Hyde {{began her}} career in journalism as a {{temporary}} secretary on the showbiz desk at The Sun newspaper. In an otherwise unrelated article in the Guardian she wrote [...] "...I am only called Marina Hyde because my real name was too long to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> a single column in the Sun, where I started out". She was later sacked by Sun editor David Yelland after it emerged she had been exchanging emails with Piers Morgan, editor of rival newspaper the Daily Mirror.|$|E
5000|$|The carhop {{drive-in}} service began further west, at a viewpoint off Marine Drive in Point Grey, when Bailey served {{food from}} a vehicle. Drivers parked nearby asked if food could {{be delivered to}} their cars, so Bailey hired servers who [...] "hopped to it" [...] to do so. Similar drive-in carhop service, with servers bringing trays and food to diners' cars to eat on-site, using trays that <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the seats between vehicles' windows, which became standard at White Spot outlets. Some locations still offer drive-in service.|$|E
50|$|Although both angles {{are related}} to the theme of {{organizational}} ambidexterity, they strongly differ in the way how they are configured. There has always been a debate of which of the two different approaches is right. The dual type allows both discrete orientations and <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> dimensions at the unit level but creates a misfit between organizational units. Some researchers argued that inconsistent structures may lead to low performance. There are also some researchers trying to investigate the external and internal contingencies under which different configurations can be found. One factor would be the speed and type of technological change that organizations confront. On the other hand, the balanced type (i.e. contextual ambidexterity) is consistent with the systems approach of <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> multiple dimensions, but contradicts the opinion that organizational choice is discrete. In an environment where changes are slow, there will be sufficient time to react to the radical changes by constructing dual structures and strategies. However, in a high-competitive environment, balanced structures may be better prepared to deal with the constant need for alignment. In future studies, the different organizational ambidexterity configurations can be compared to find a better solution for dealing with the exploitation and exploration paradox.|$|E
5000|$|Baggage is {{normally}} stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that <b>fits</b> <b>across</b> {{the width of}} the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of freight and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items [...] "hold down" [...] rings are provided to tie items into place.|$|R
50|$|The L11 {{class was}} {{one of a number of}} designs by Dugald Drummond {{incorporating}} a large proportion of standard parts that could be interchanged with other classes of locomotive. The boiler was interchangeable with the T9 class, and likewise was equipped with water tubes <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the firebox combustion space, with the aim of increasing heating surface whilst facilitating water circulation; this device however also increased maintenance costs and was soon removed by Drummond's successor, Robert Urie.|$|R
50|$|A rigid {{treatment}} that sometimes {{serves as a}} mask for holding attached stationary draperies or for hiding window hardware or even masking architectural flaws. The cornice is typically constructed of a chipboard-style wood or lightweight material over which some kind of padding is placed, then covered with a fabric of choice and finished with decorate trim or cording to cover any seams. Only <b>fits</b> <b>across</b> {{the top of the}} window frame. Can be a terrific focal point; usually mounted {{on the outside of the}} window frame.|$|R
50|$|Edwards and Peccei (2007) {{developed}} an OI measure that taps into three separate but closely related factors of OI. The three factors include a) the categorization {{of the self}} as an organizational member, b) {{the integration of the}} organization’s goals and values, as well as c) the development of an emotional attachment, belongingness, and membership to the organization. Appropriately, these three factors incorporate the main components from OI definitions throughout OI research thus far. Because each factor was measured by two separate items, Edwards and Peccei were able to conduct confirmatory factor analysis for their three factor model <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> two independent samples.|$|E
5000|$|The Calder and Hebble {{navigation}} {{is another}} river navigation, which saw commercial coal traffic until 1981, when deliveries to Thornhill Power Station by water ceased. The first three locks, up to Broad Cut Low Lock, were enlarged {{as a result}} on co-operation with the Aire and Calder Navigation, and are 120 by 17.5 ft. Broad Cut Top Lock and those above it are still sized for Yorkshire Keels, and are only 57 by 14 ft. It is possible to negotiate the locks is a 60 ft narrowboat, but the boat has to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> the lock diagonally to do so. The locks also require a handspike to open the paddles.|$|E
50|$|As fours and sixes shared {{production}} tooling, {{the four}} {{also had a}} long stroke and siamesed cylinder liners, even though it did not need the reduced width. This was especially true in later designs of transverse-engined BMC and BL cars, when the side-mounted radiator was moved to <b>fit</b> <b>across</b> {{the nose of the}} car reducing overall width of the engine considerably. The lack of water jacketing caused considerable development problems when the 1.5 L in the Austin Maxi needed an optional larger engine size. The 1.5 L four-cylinder E-series could not be readily bored out, the placing of the gearbox directly underneath the sump made stroking the engine more difficult, and the Maxi was too narrow to accommodate a large-capacity six-cylinder. Overcoming these problems meant that even a modestly increased displacement, to 1748 cc, did not appear until 1971.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{changes for}} the AS series {{included}} uprated rear springs and reduction in rear anti-roll bar diameter. Improvements were also made to the TX5 Ghia's adjustable suspension. In terms of braking, Ghias were now fitted with four-wheel disc brakes; Telstar GL and TX5 retained front discs and rear drums. Ventilated front disc brakes and semi-metallic pads were now <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the range to provide, {{in conjunction with the}} brake cooling ducts in the front valance, increased brake cooling capacity and reduced brake fade and squeal.|$|R
5000|$|May 1979: Introduction of the Maxi 1750 HLS with walnut dash and twin {{carburettor}} [...] engine previously {{restricted to}} the HL (HL now with the single carburettor and wood dash). All models now feature the same copper colored front grill badge, black wipers and door mirrors, the rear tailgate badge is now located below the trim line, also revised illuminated switches, cigar lighter and revised windscreen wiper control instrumentation. The 1500/1750 now have 'Marle' fabric seat facings replacing the previous PVC [...] "basketweave" [...] leatherette. Single rear foglight now <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the range.|$|R
50|$|Available {{with the}} 1093 cc engine the Coupé {{featured}} additions such as sporting seats trim, wheel arch extensions, rear spoiler, low profile tyres and a rev counter, {{as well as}} the round headlights which were later <b>fitted</b> <b>across</b> the range. The GL featured a 60 PS (44 kW) engine. In 1985, the first sporty Polo, the Coupé GT, was introduced with a 75 PS (55 kW) engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats and a rev counter. Other special feature models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country.|$|R
