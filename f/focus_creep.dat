In this work, we analyze interaction between the elastic deflection of a slender beam and viscous flow within a long serpentine channel, embedded in the elastic beam.

40|$|Abstract: The {{collapse}} of several historical masonry towers has {{been attributed to}} gradually increasing mechanical damage, such as creep cracking which occurs under constant stress levels. This paper reviews theoretical, experimental and numerical methods for analysing compressive creep in historical masonry. The investigations <b>focus</b> on <b>creep</b> behaviour in ferruginous sandstone, as results are applied to understand the {{collapse of}} two historical towers in Belgium that were both constructed in local sandstone. At the level of the material, cracking, creep strains and acoustic emissions are studied in small-to-medium scale sandstone samples under dry and saturated conditions. Results indicate an acceleration of the degradation process when water absorption takes place during the secondary creep phase. At the structural level, numerical macro modelling is performed to investigate the effect of stress redistributions on creep behaviour of three-leaf masonry. Finally, experimental and numerical results are related to the collapse of two historical towers. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} crack tip {{blunting}} {{on the initial}} stages of creep crack growth is investigated by means of a planar microstructural model in which grains are represented discretely. The actual linking-up process of discrete microcracks with the macroscopic crack is simulated, with full account of the underlying physical mechanisms such as the nucleation, growth and coalescence of grain boundary cavities accompanied by grain boundary sliding. Results are presented for C*-controlled mode I crack growth under small-scale damage conditions. Particular attention is <b>focused</b> on <b>creep</b> constrained vs. unconstrained growth. Also the effect of grain boundary shear stresses on linking-up is investigated through shear-modified nucleation and growth models. The computations show a general trend that while an initially sharp crack tends to propagate away from the original crack plane, crack tip blunting reduces the crack growth direction. Under unconstrained conditions this can be partly rationalized by the strain rate and facet stress distribution corresponding to steady-state creep. ...|$|R

40|$|Length {{effect on}} creep of silicon {{cantilever}} microbeams Hsien-Kuang Liu and Jen-Jui Chao Creep behavior {{is very important}} to reliability of micromechanical components. Therefore, there are some emerging research efforts that <b>focus</b> on <b>creep</b> of silicon. However, few have focused on interaction among microscale dimension effect, temperature, and applied stress, which are more crucial to micro-electrical mechanical system components compared with regular size components. This paper presents investigation of creep of single crystal silicon cantilever microbeams with a specific focus on the length effect. Results are presented characterizing the creep behavior in the length range of 300 – 700 mm, the temperature range of 600 – 700 C, and the stress range of 235 – 501 MPa. As the temperature or stress increases, the creep rate of silicon increases and duration of the steady-state creep decreases. Creep rate decreases with the increase of microbeam length. At 600 C, creep rupture lifetime approximately increases with the increase of microbeam length. At 700 C, maximum lifetime shifts to medium length of 400 mm. Factors that influence rupture lifetime include short beam effect, defect distribution, stress, temperature, and brittleness caused by oxidation. To summarize, creep failure modes for short beam and long beam are, respectively, dislocation motion by multiple slip systems and single slip system...|$|R

The incremental governing equations are formulated via the variational principle of virtual work based on an incremental exponential algorithm for the creep modelling.

SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PROJECTS Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) {{has long been}} a desired cool-season turfgrass species for use in golf course settings. From greens to tees and fairways, it has withstood the test of time, becoming the most sought after turf by avid golfers and greenskeepers alike. After an in-depth look at creeping bentgrass management recommendations in the Midwest, two main areas are identified as lacking in supporting research: late-fall nitrogen fertility on putting greens and a cost-effective approach for fairway establishment in annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) infested turf. Late-fall nitrogen fertility has been regarded as an integral component in coolseason turfgrass nutrition programs for almost four decades. The benefits of this application from a turfgrass quality standpoint are fairly clear, though recent environmental concerns and rising nitrogen fertilizer costs have pressured turfgrass researchers to re-evaluate the benefit and efficiency of these applications. The late-fall nitrogen research herein <b>focuses</b> on <b>creeping</b> bentgrass in Upper Midwest putting green situations, with an attempt to quantify benefits and determine nitrogen uptake efficiency from various application strategies. Annual bluegrass is a weedy species, which has long been problematic on golf courses throughout the world. More time and money is devoted to controlling this species than any other weed, and most attempts have achieved marginal success at best. Greenskeepers are constantly looking for a cost-effective approach to establish creeping bentgrass in annual bluegrass infested turf. This research looks at a quick and effective way to increase creeping bentgrass populations on annual bluegrass fairways...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutive}} {{mechanical behaviour}} with a <b>focus</b> on <b>creep</b> of Sn-Pb and various Sn-Ag-Cu based Pb-free solders in the 25 - 150 °C temperature range {{has been studied}} using nanoindentation and various new meso-scale tests. All alloys have been studied as bulk wave soldering bars, as-received solder balls and solder joints. Ball Grid Array (BGA) solder joints in a typical electronic configuration were manufactured in-house using both Cu and Pd-Ag metallizations. Microstructural characterisation of all configurations used various types of optical and electron microscopy and showed that the solder pad metallization type {{played a major role}} in intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. There were comparatively fine and coarse-grained microstructures in both as-received solder balls and BGA solder joints depending on ball diameter. Nanoindentation creep measurements in the stress range 20 - 500 MPa showed that grain boundary sliding occurred together with dislocation glide and dislocation climb in the low temperature (25 - 50 °C) and high temperature (100 - 150 °C) regimes respectively. Smaller grain sizes (New elevated temperature mechanical tests were developed using the nanoindentation platform to enable testing of entire solder joints in shear and compression, with stresses in the 1 E- 2 - 3 MPa range, more relevant to in-service conditions than those in nanoindentation. Meso-scale spherical indentation creep behaviour in compression on as-reflowed solder balls showed good agreement with that obtained by conventional nanoindentation. However, when BGAs were tested in shear, the solder microstructure had relatively little influence on the creep response, which was significantly less creep resistant than individual phases in the ball obtained by nanoindentation or the ball itself obtained by meso-scale spherical indentation. In shear, the creep conformed to diffusion controlled behaviour and interfacial microstructure was suggested to now control creep response, with the microstructure of the majority of the solder joint playing only a minor role.

The proposed creep formulation uses a power-law function expressing the creep strain by means of one coefficient and two exponents. This function needs a fewer number of material coefficients than a classical mathematical analysis of non-linear viscoelasticity, so design applications, such as FEM codes, may more simply describe the deformations in the long term. The formulation has been developed for cantilever beams made of glulam timber using experimental tests in bending and accounting the relations between strains, and both time and tension progresses.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the mechanical properties of uncompacted rockfill and the creep deformation behaviour of rockfill under a load as well as finding a suitable method for estimation of creep deformation behaviour, a full scale embankment loading experiment was performed. The results of this experiment were then evaluated. During {{the course of this}} study it became evident to the author that the deformations which were seen in the collected data from the experiment could be classified as creep deformations due to the linear decrease of the deformation against the logarithm of time and the study therefore came to <b>focus</b> on <b>creep.</b> One constitutive equation and one model for estimation of creep deformations were studied, and parameters were obtained through back analysis of experiment data as well as calculation of soil stresses. The creep model was based on a logarithmic approximation of the creep deformations and the creep equation was based on a power function. The creep model could also be simplified and evaluated as an equation and when a comparison was made between the equations and the measured results this showed that the logarithmic equation resulted in estimates closer to the measured deformations than what the power function did, therefore a logarithmic function is a better approximation to the deformations of the rockfill at Norvik than the power function. When the creep model was evaluated as intended, based on the soil stresses, the resulting creep estimates were less accurate, they was however still within the limits of what can be considered as admissible. The conclusion is that a logarithmic function describes the creep deformation of the rockfill at Norvik better than a power function and that the creep model by Kristensen is suitable for estimating the creep deformations. This since the creep model also provides a way of estimating deformations occurring under stress conditions other than the ones for which the creep test was performed...|$|R

This process is attracting significant attention, with a tremendous increase of studies in the metal powder densification field. Its growing popularity lies in the very fast heating rate and short cycle time driven by the Joule effect, which limits grain growth. However, this process implements different coupled electrical, thermal and mechanical phenomena. All this makes the process difficult to develop and to apply for routine industrial production, which has motivated the development of numerical simulation tools {{in order to understand}} and optimize the process. Up to now, very few models integrating the coupling between heat generation, electric transfer and mechanics have been proposed. In particular, a numerical predictive model for powder densification requires a good understanding of the mechanical behavior, in our case a viscoplastic compressive law (Abouaf mechanical model).
