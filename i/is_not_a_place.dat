25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{believe the}} word soul (nephesh or psykhe) {{as used in}} the Bible is a person, an animal, or the life a person or animal enjoys. Hence, the soul {{is not part of}} man, but is the whole man—man as a living being. Hence, when a person or animal dies, the soul dies, and death is a state of non-existence, based on Psalms 146:4, Ezekiel 18:4, and other passages. Hell (Hades <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of fiery torment, but rather the common grave of humankind, a place of unconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|Many of today's Biblical scholars, such as N. T. Wright, in {{tracing the}} concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as {{overlapping}} or interlocking. Heaven is known as God's space, his dimension, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that {{can be reached by}} human technology. This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside people on Earth. One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the New Heavens and New Earth of the World to Come.|$|E

50|$|During this period, part of {{the first}} {{settlement}} of Norfolk Island (1788-1814), Norfolk Island was basically a free settlement with convicts making up no more than 10 per cent of the population. While some individuals were sent from Sydney as a means of isolation, the Island <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of secondary punishment as it became in the second settlement (1825-1855).|$|R

During Springtime, just before {{the anniversary of the}} foundation of Rome, April 21st, part of the steps are covered by pots of azaleas, up until early May. In modern times the Spanish Steps have included a small cut-flower market.

500|$|Mining {{activity}} was initially {{concentrated in the}} eastern (upper) valleys of the Trinity River around Weaverville, as the hostile Native Americans and treacherous gorges around Burnt Ranch precluded the transport of rations and equipment to places further west. For about two decades the area was extremely productive, {{second only to the}} Sierra Nevada (the Mother Lode) itself. The rate at which gold was extracted, and new methods pioneered to access the harder to reach deposits, was feverish. Author James Hilton remarked that Weaverville was a [...] "Shangri-La, that strange and wonderful somewhere which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> but a state of mind." [...] The area was soon profiting $1.5 million a year, with hundreds of claims along the Trinity River equipped with flumes, waterwheels and other apparatus to separate fine gold from river gravel.|$|E
500|$|Other {{philosophers}} and writers identified as influences include Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ray Brassier, Emil Cioran, and Eugene Thacker. Mathijs Peters, {{in a piece}} for Film International, argued that True Detective probes Schopenhauerian philosophy through its approach to individuality, self-denial, the battle between dark and light, and so forth. Ben Woodard noted the show's evolving philosophy, which examines a setting where culture, religion, and society are direct by-products of biological weakness. Woodward wrote, [...] "Biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions, faiths, and acerbic personalities take the reins of uncertain ends creating a world where 'people go away'." [...] Even the setting, Fintan Neylan argued, emphasizes a world [...] "where the decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden." [...] He stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where hope fled; {{it is a place}} where hope could never take root. It is with these people and environs that the real horror is sourced." [...] Yet Neylan observed that Cohle's actions are not motivated by misanthropy, rather a drive to challenge [...] "those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit." [...] And in doing so, Cohle ultimately confronts [...] "an entire philosophical history which has taken its task as that of sweeping frailty away." [...] Christopher Orr at The Atlantic said True Detective was [...] "Fincherian in the best sense", a fusion of Se7en (1995) and Zodiac (2007), because of its subject matter, sleek cinematography, and [...] "vivid, unsettling" [...] aura.|$|E
500|$|A U.S. Army {{recruitment}} officer {{comes to}} the high school to hold an assembly and entices the students with a glamorized, deceptive video presentation, which impresses every one including Chris. Chris returns home and tells the family during dinner that he wants to enlist, but Lois attempts to dissuade him, for the military <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for him. The next day, while driving Stewie to Gymboree Play & Music for parachute day, Brian decides to take a detour to the recruitment office to scold the recruiting officer for trying to trick Chris through devious means. The two arrive at the office but the wait is long; when Brian goes to top-up the parking meter [...] Stewie walks into the office. Stewie ends up enlisting in the Army and signs Brian up as well when told there [...] "is a $100 bonus for signing up a buddy." [...] Brian returns and is shocked. Brian and Stewie begin basic training, but Brian becomes stressed from the discipline and decides one night to leave. Stewie wakes up and finds Brian packing his suitcase, but he manages {{to talk him out of}} leaving, insisting that he had never finished anything significant in his life and that the Army will provide him the discipline. With this, Brian decides to stay. After they complete their training, Stewie and Brian are deployed to Iraq. Meantime, the two are patrolling the streets of a village, commenting on the [...] "good situation so far"; however, after the pair get caught up in a terrorist attack, they become dissuaded and decide to find a way to get out of the Army. They first attempt to be discharged by pretending to be homosexual (only to discover that one of their superiors is gay). As a last resort, they attempt to get [...] "Wounded in Action" [...] by shooting each other in the foot; they do this only to find out that the Army now takes anyone no matter what, going so far as to allow two corpses to guard the ammunition. They are then told that democracy has kicked in and the war is over, thus meaning all the soldiers can return to the United States.|$|E

In the later medieval period the town prospered; it became a {{thriving}} commercial and political centre for south Dorset, with a textile trading and manufacturing industry which continued until the 17th century. In {{the time of}} Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625).|$|R

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Alevis and Sunnis {{is one of}} mutual suspicion and prejudice {{dating back to the}} Ottoman period. [...] Hundreds of Alevis were murdered in sectarian violence in the years that preceded the 1980 coup, and as late as the 1990s dozens were killed with impunity. While pogroms have not occurred since them, the Erdogan has declared “a cemevi <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of worship, it is a center for cultural activities.

50|$|At first, Laodicea <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of much importance, {{but it soon}} {{acquired}} {{a high degree of}} prosperity. In 220 BC, Achaeus was its king. In 188 BC, the city passed to the Kingdom of Pergamon, and after 133 BC it fell under Roman control. It suffered greatly during the Mithridatic Wars but quickly recovered under the dominion of Rome. Towards the end of the Roman Republic and under the first emperors, Laodicea, benefiting from its advantageous position on a trade route, {{became one of the most}} important and flourishing commercial cities of Asia Minor, in which large money transactions and an extensive trade in black wool were carried on.|$|R

2500|$|In this work, one of {{his most}} {{emphatic}} statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: [...] "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where justice resides." ...|$|E

2500|$|Visually, the {{presentation}} of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as [...] "bombardment". Rogers also believed in not acting out a different persona on camera compared to how he acted off camera, stating that [...] "One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away." [...] Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and skits. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to show children that a hospital <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to fear. During the Gulf War (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise {{to take care of their}} own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
