5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, {{with the condition}} that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain {{to meet him at}} the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, a seal {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century. Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.|$|E

6000|$|The {{beautiful}} nest of a field-mouse {{has been}} found in a cypress's thick foliage, and dead shrews bestrew the paths; though the magic effects of having a [...] "sherry mouse" [...] die <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> thus being enabled to stroke cattle and cure them, have never been experienced.|$|R
50|$|Organ pipes are so {{sensitive}} to temperature {{that the body}} heat of the organ tuner can affect the tuning. If one holds a small metal flue pipe briefly <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> then returns it to the chest, its pitch (relative to a tuning reference) can be heard to change as the pipe returns to room temperature.|$|R
5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> bears a shield decorated {{with the face of}} Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} {{departed}} Guam at 23:43. As {{the second wave}} landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a radio in the other. His request {{to speak with the}} ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal. The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on Guam at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|R

25|$|A {{memorial}} in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio {{is on the}} summit of the grounds in Section 134.

A bronze cenotaph identifies him as Johnny Appleseed with a brief biography and eulogy.|$|E
25|$|The 1939 World's Fair on Treasure Island, in San Francisco Bay, {{attracted}} many celebrities to San Francisco {{and to the}} St. Francis.

25|$|The Nauvoo Temple was {{the first}} Latter Day Saint temple to be crowned with a figure of an angel. This angel, not officially {{identified}} as Moroni, was a metal weathervane with gold leaf on the trumpet. It was designed by William Weeks (architect of Nauvoo temple) and installed in January 1846. This figure was positioned in a flying horizontal position holding an open book <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a trumpet in the other.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} there were 20 {{fighting}} postures in training; The Ashanti people practitioners of the past generally used low kicking techniques to distract, dismantle and disable the opponent when holding the sword <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> sheath in the other. The sword-based fighting techniques is similar in part to that of Eskrima and the combat hand-techniques and kicking techniques is similar in part to that of Wing Chun.|$|E
25|$|Short draw {{spinning}} is used {{to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from combed roving, sliver or wool top. The spinner keeps his/her hands very close to each other.

There is never any twist between the two hands.|$|E

25|$|Ties rarely occur, since {{multiple}} simultaneous player eliminations will {{rank the}} eliminated players by chip counts. However, if {{two or more}} players are eliminated <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> both players started the hand with identical chip counts, the players will be tied in official rankings. It is impossible for poker tournaments to end in a tie (since one player must end {{up with all the}} chips), though multiple players may be tied for second (or lower) place.|$|E
25|$|After Brunel's {{death the}} {{decision}} was taken that standard gauge {{should be used for}} all railways in the country. At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at Neyland, sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and a number of information boards there depict various aspects of Brunel's life. There is also a larger than life bronze statue of him holding a steamship <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a locomotive in the other. The statue has been replaced after an earlier theft.|$|E
