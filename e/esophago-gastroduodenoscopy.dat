40|$|Introduction Automatic {{access to}} {{information}} in clinical free text can provide support for medical decision support, outcome research, continuous quality improvement, and information retrieval. We discuss three strategies to improve results when using MetaMap [1] to map strings in gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) reports to concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. Due to word sense ambiguity, synonymy, and context-specific meaning, using MetaMap without modification produces limited results in this domain. For example, esophagus is incorrectly mapped to "Procedures of the esophagus.

40|$|The {{representative}} endoscopic {{features of}} primary intestinal follicular lymphoma {{are well known}} as small whitish polypoid nodules, but a magnified view has only been described in a few case reports. Herein, we report a case with intestinal fol-licular lymphoma in which magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was helpful for prompt diagnosis. A 57 -year-old Japanese woman underwent surveillance <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy.</b> The endoscopic examination revealed confluent whitish granules in the duodenum, distinct from the nodules or polyps that are typical findings of intestinal follicular lymphoma. Magnifying endoscopy visualized whit-ish enlarged villi, and narrow band imaging emphasized an elongated and coiled vascular pattern.

METHODS: We analyzed medical records of 50   114 consecutive patients submitted to for first diagnostic <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> between January 2004 and December 2009. We excluded lesions on the ampulla of Vater and submucosal tumors. We studied 510 cases that were diagnosed endoscopically with duodenal polyps and enrolled {{a total of}} 221 cases that had undergone tissue biopsy. We analyzed the differences between non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, and determined the clinical features of duodenal hyperplastic polyps. RESULTS: Non-neoplastic lesions were found in 196 patients and neoplastic lesions in 25 patients. On univariate analysis, {{there were significant differences}} in shape, location, and size. Polyps more than 10 mm in diameter or polyps in the second portion had independent risk factors for being neoplastic lesions, as identified by multivariate analysis.

40|$|Introduction: We {{report a}} rare case of {{duodenal}} metastasis from primary lung adenocarcinoma presented with history of melena and weight loss. Presentation of case: A 52 -year-old smoker man presented with six months history of epigastric pain, melena and weight loss. <b>Esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> revealed a 10  mm ulcerative lesion {{in the fourth}} part of duodenum. Histopathology of resected lesion showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumor cells showed immunopositivity for cytokeratin- 7 (CK 7), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF- 1), and immunonegativity for CK 20, Villin, CDX 2 and thyroglobulin, supporting the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung origin. Computed tomography (CT) of chest revealed left hilar mass encasing the main pulmonary artery associated with ipsilateral hilar and contralateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy assisted biopsy of lung mass confirmed the diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma. Patient was staged as T 4 N 3 M 1. After the resection of duodenal metastasis followed by three cycles of cisplatinum based chemotherapy with Bevacizumab, melena resolved completely. Discussion: Duodenal metastases from lung adenocarcinoma are extremely uncommon, and rarely produce symptoms. Most of cases require duodenectomy or pancreatico-duodenectomy for symptomatic relief. For smaller duodenal metastatic lesions (≤ 1  cm) endoscopic resection is a feasible therapeutic option.

40|$|Chronic {{constipation}} that is unresponsive to laxative {{treatment is}} a severe illness, but children unresponsive to laxatives {{have been successfully}} treated with an elimination diet. We report the first cases of refractory chronic constipation caused by food hypersensitivity in adults. Four patients with refractory constipation who were unresponsive to high doses of laxatives were put on an oligo-antigenic diet and underwent successive double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenges (DBPFC). Routine laboratory tests, immunological assays, colonoscopy, <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> and rectal and duodenal histology were performed. While on an elimination diet, bowel habits normalized in all patients and a DBPFC challenge triggered the reappearance of constipation. In comparison with another 13 patients with refractory constipation unresponsive to the elimination diet, observed over the same period, the patients with food-hypersensitivity-related constipation had the following characteristics: longer duration of illness (p < 0. 03), lower body mass index (p < 0. 03), higher frequency of self-reported food intolerance (p < 0. 01), higher frequency of nocturnal abdominal pain and anal itching (p < 0. 01). In patients with food hypersensitivity, hemoglobin concentrations and peripheral leukocytes were lower than those in controls (p < 0. 03).

These two lesions were resected en bloc by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Pathological examination of the resected specimen showed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub 2) and well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub 1), respectively, which were limited to the mucosal layer. Because lymphatic-vascular involvement was not detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, additional gastrectomy was not performed. Two months after ESD, follow-up EUS and CT showed an enlarged LN. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for the LN revealed metastasis.

Although, to our knowledge, few studies have compared the {{prevalence of}} GERD in both groups of patients, yet most authorities believe that the disease is more prevalent in PD patients. The aim of the current study is to clarify the relation between dialysis modalities and GERD. The study involved 68 ESRD patients who are on regular hemodialysis (group 1) and 71 age- and sex-matched ESRD patients on peritoneal dialysis (group 2). All patients were subjected to <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> for proper evaluation. The prevalence of GERD and reflux esophagitis (RE) was similar in the two groups (45. 6 % vs 47. 9. 2 % and 36. 8 % vs 39. 4 % respectively) (P> 0. 05). The duration of dialysis, serum creatinine of 7 or over, the presence of diabetes mellitus, body mass index of 27 kg/m 2 or over, smoking and the absence of H. pylori infection were significantly associated with GERD and RE, while the dialysis modality, age, gender, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hypoalbuminemia and aspirin use were not.

40|$|Objectives An {{imbalance}} of free radicals and scavenging processes has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of pancreatic tissue injury. Gradual decreases in antioxidant enzyme expression in pancreatic cells from normal pancreas to chronic pancreatitis to pancreatic cancer have been reported. Zinc {{is one of the}} components of antioxidant enzymes and {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of pancreatic diseases. A recent report showed a significant decrease in pancreatic zinc output in patients with chronic pancreatitis and proposed that zinc output can be used as an alternative to enzyme output for the diagnosis. We aimed to determine the zinc concentration in pancreatic fluid of patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer compared to normal pancreas. Patients Seventy-five consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated. Chronic pancreatitis was diagnosed in 20 patients by ERCP (n= 16) and histology (n= 4). Pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 17 patients by cytology from EUS-FNA (n= 12) or surgical pathology (n= 5). Thirty-eight patients were confirmed to have normal pancreas. Interventions Patients underwent <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> following intravenous secretin injection (0. 2 µg/kg). Pancreatic fluid collected for 10 minutes was immediately frozen at- 80 °C and stored until the assay was performed.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aim: Diagnostic <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> (EGD) is uncomfortable for most patients. We {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} alprazolam, administered orally or sublingually, as premedication for sedation during EGD. Patients and methods: Adult EGD candidates were randomly allocated to four groups (n= 55, each group) and received alprazolam (0. 5 mg) sublingually or orally, placebo sublingually or orally at 30 minutes before EGD. Main outcome measures included procedure-related anxiety and pain/discomfort (assessed using 11 -point numeric scales), patient overall tolerance (assessed using a 4 -point Likert scale), need for intravenous sedation, and willingness to repeat the EGD if necessary. Results: Patients experienced greater reduction in anxiety score after medication with sublingual alprazolam (mean 2. 25, standard deviation SD] 1. 73) compared with sublingual placebo (mean 0. 10, standard error SE] 0. 15]; P< 0. 001) and oral alprazolam (0. 63, SE 0. 14; P< 0. 001). Also, pain/discomfort scores were lower with sublingual alprazolam compared with sublingual placebo (3. 29, SE 0. 29 vs. 4. 16, SD 1. 86; P= 0. 024), and with oral alprazolam compared with oral placebo (3. 48, SD 1. 69 vs. 5. 13, SD 2. 39; P< 0. 001). Patient overall tolerance was better with sublingual alprazolam than with sublingual placebo (P 0. 005) or with oral alprazolam (P= 0. 009). Regarding intravenous sedation, {{there was no difference}} between sublingual alprazolam and sublingual placebo (10. 9 % vs. 10. 9 %; P= 0. 619) or between oral alprazolam and oral placebo (9. 0 % vs. 12. 7 %; P= 0. 381). Willingness to repeat the procedure was greater with sublingual alprazolam than with sublingual placebo (50. 9 % vs. 30. 9 %: P= 0. 026).

Aim: To study the prevalence of chromogranin A (CgA) in chronic dyspepsia, IBS and chronic diarrhea at Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital. Patients & Method: All patients (age> 15 years) who presented with chronic dyspepsia, IBS and chronic diarrhea at Medical Department of Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital during February-April 2010 were enrolled. The exclusion criteria were chronic renal failure, previous PPI use within 1 week, chronic heart failure. The blood samples were obtained and plasma CgA level was measured with radioimmunoassay commercially kits in central laboratory of Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Results: Seventy-five patients were enrolled. Most of them were female (72 %), living in Nakhon Ratchasima Province (94. 7 %) and had no co-morbid diseases (78. 7 %). Their mean age was 49. 5 + 12. 1 years. Majority of samples (86. 7 %) presented with chronic dyspepsia and median duration of their symptoms was 1 year. The mean of plasma CgA level was 246 + 10. 9 ng/ml (except 3 cases which had CgA level more than 870 ng/ml). Of them, 39 patients (52 %) had plasma CgA level more than the cut off level.

40|$|The {{sectional}} image-based examination technique {{described in}} this paper shall lead to {{an expansion of the}} spectrum of diagnoses for gastrointestinal diseases. The techniques will either become complementary procedures or will even be able to replace other older procedures. Future studies shall be able to determine their true value. In the following the results of this work shall be summarized referring in particular {{to the role of the}} individually described procedures in clinical and radiological diagnostics: CT-colonography: An important outcome from our studies on CT-colonography was that for the first time it could be shown using the multiline spiral CT, in our work using 16 or 64 -multiline spiral CT, that even very small colorectal space occupying lesions with minimal diameters in the range of only a few millimeters could be detected with a relatively high sensitivity, and that their detection decisively depends on the two- or three-dimensional reconstruction mode selected. Regarding sensitivity and specificity, the best results were achievable using the colon dissection mode within the other reconstruction methods. This reconstruction method produced a virtual representation of the colon in longitudinal strips with an angle of view of 45 ° from an orthogonal camera aspect. Apart from the optimal view of the colonic mucosa and with that the higher detection sensitivity for smaller space occupying lesions, this reconstruction method also allowed the diagnostics to be carried out in a much shorter period of time. The colon dissection-mode according to our studies represents a clear optimization of the CT-colonography in this respect. Although this procedure offers many benefits, evaluation with traditional techniques employing an endoluminal view proved to be relatively time-consuming and sometimes even defective since the same restrictions of visibility occur, as is the case with conventional coloscopy. Space occupying lesions which are localized immediately behind wrinkles or in furrows can escape diagnostic detection. In our experience these limitations were the reasons why CT colonography under routine operation were associated with not unimportant diagnostic and temporal problems. The colon-dissection mode allows us to bypass this limitation because of the orthogonal positioning of the virtual camera. Because of the better overview, a larger section of intestinal mucosa can be visualized per unit of time, and a time-consuming endoluminal advancement of the virtual camera is not necessary. The resultant benefits with respect to diagnostic precision and the ability evaluate more rapidly leads to a clear optimization of the entire procedure so that the fundamental benefits of CT-colonography over conventional colonoscopy become even more apparent. These include the lacking invasiveness, a fact that precludes the need for sedation, the independence from operator ability and reproducibility, the possibility of looking into stenoses that can not be passed by conventional colonoscopy (and as such the detection of synchronous neoplasms), the precise topographical localization of a pathological finding, the determination of the extraluminal tumor infiltration depth, and the possibility of implementing a combined staging within a single session. CT-colonography renders the traditional colon double contrast technique for the diagnosis of polyps and tumor as superfluous, since CT-colonography is superior regarding both sensitivity and specificity, usually entails less radiation exposure for the patient and operator, can be carried out faster, and requires no barium sulfate particularly where pre-operative examinations are concerned. CT-colonography is the method of choice for technically unfeasible or only partially feasible situations with conventional colonoscopy. In the first-mentioned case CT colonography can be applied immediately after a conventional colonoscopy is carried out. CT-colonography should be applied primarily for patients under anticoagulant therapy and those with severe cardiac arrhythmias. Amongst patients with high a colorectal carcinoma risk a staging examination of the thorax and the abdomen can be carried out as a complement to the colorectal tumor diagnostics within the same session. Patients with colorectal polyposis syndromes and a hereditarily raised intestinal cancer risk should also be screened by conventional colonoscopy in a closely knit fashion with a simultaneous therapeutic option. The potential use of virtual colonoscopy for early diagnostics requires further evaluation in multi-center studies. Because of the improved patient acceptance in particular, CT-colonography is likely to establish itself as an attractive alternative to existing medical check-ups. Conventional colonoscopy is still to be considered as a recommendable procedure primarily because of the therapeutic option that it provides. Nevertheless, this medical check-up procedure is only undergone by about 5 % of the general population, so that 95 % of the target population escapes screening. If the CT-colonography is truly able to increase the size of the screened population, this diagnostic option, which offers comparable sensitivity to conventional colonoscopy, would be highly welcomed indeed. At this point in time it can therefore be stated that the sectioning imaging procedure of CT-colonography can be offered as an alternative to conventional colonoscopy (and possible MR colonoscopy, see below). Doctors and patients should decide together the chosen procedure after a full consultation considering the medical goals, any possible preexisting or accompanying disorders, and the individual needs of the patient. MR-colonography: MR-colonography is an easily implementable NMR tomographic examination of the colon whereby body-heat water is applied via a rectal probe to achieve a distension of the intracolonic space. This procedure is increasing in value within the field of sectional imaging diagnostics of GI diseases because of the outstanding soft-tissue contrast that it offers. Tumorous and inflammatory intestinal wall alterations as well as extraluminal manifestations and complications of a disease can be reliably detected. Regarding the detection of colorectal polyps, the procedure has a lower sensitivity than that of CT-colonography particularly with polyps that are less than 6 mm in size. The inferior performance of MR-colonography for detecting smaller polyps appears to be unproblematic when considering the biology of transformation. A relevant transformation risk of more than 1 % exists only for colorectal polyps that are larger than 10 mm in size. As long as these lesions can be detected with certainty, the use of MR-colonography for the early detection of colorectal space occupying lesions appears entirely feasible. The diagnostics of inflammatory intestinal diseases using bright lumen MR-colonography is based on the depiction of intestinal wall thickening, and that of colorectal space occupying lesions on the visualization of filling defects. Although this technique has proven effective over the last years, it does have some limitations. Thus a distinction between polyp, residual stools and air pockets is not always possible even when evaluating data records in different patient positions. The informative value of black lumen MR-colonography regarding the detection of colorectal space occupying lesions has only been assessed up until now in a few studies. The results seem more favorable than those from bright lumen colonography and suggest a high diagnostic precision for that procedure. The domain of MR-colonography is the sectional imaging diagnostics of chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases. Because of the higher soft-tissue contrast, the typical signs of intestinal wall inflammation can be reliably represented. In addition, extraluminal complications such as fistulae, conglomerate tumors and abscesses can be detected. The application of paramagnetic contrast medium assists in the detection of inflamed tissue and the extent of inflammation can also be determined as an objective parameter. As such, while the value of MR-colonography for the diagnostics and follow-up of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders is growing in importance, a similar assessment for its use in the diagnostics of colorectal space occupying lesions can be reported, as is the case for CT- colonography. The potential use of MR-colonography for early recognition should be assessed further in multi-center studies. Just as with CT-colonography, MR-colonography might establish itself as an alternative procedure with presumably greater acceptance in comparison to conventional colonoscopy. MR-colonography will presumably gain in importance due to the lacking radiation exposure compared to CT-colonography, since as a matter of principle the use of ionizing radiation for the screening of potentially healthy people is difficult to justify. Without a doubt conventional colonoscopy can still be considered as a recommendable procedure primarily because of the therapeutic option that is also offered. As long as MR-colonography is able to increase the size of the screening population, this diagnostic option can therefore be included within the range of established procedures. Also in this regard a full consultation should be provided before a decision to choose between the procedures. We currently favor CT-colonography for the detection of colorectal space occupying lesions and MR-colonography for the diagnosis and follow up of inflammatory intestinal disorders. MR-Sellink: The MR-Sellink is a procedure, which has its greatest value in the diagnostics and follow-up of chronic-inflammatory intestinal disorders. It was modified by us and expanded with a dynamic component involving the continuous application of fluid during data acquisition that leads to an optimal and controlled distension of the small intestine. This distension quality can not be guaranteed during examination without this dynamic component. The diagnostic quality of the MR-Sellink therefore benefits from the dynamic component and our studies show that the detection and differentiation of scar-associated and functional stenoses is possible. The anatomy of the small intestine can be depicted with a comparable quality to that achieved with conventional X-ray diagnostic procedures. In addition, modifications in the intestinal wall and extraluminal complications such as abscess or fistulae can also be detected. The sensitivity of the examination regarding obstructive small intestinal lesions exceeds not just that of the other MR modalities, but because of its superposition-free depiction also conventional enteroclysma. This also applies for discreet lesions. Because of the dynamic assessibility of the procedure, functional aspects of stenosing small intestinal processes can be recognized to a similar extent as is possible with conventional enteroclysma. Because of the high resolution for details one can already recognize discreet inflammatory alterations. Because of this the procedure appears suitable as a replacement for conventional enteroclysma. This applies particularly where repeated radiological examinations are to be avoided amongst younger patients. A procedure used by us and described for the first time is the combination of MR-Sellink and MR-colonography with a continuous fluid supply via a nasojejunal probe. This procedure offers an assessment of both the small intestine and the colon in a single examination. The continuous fluid supply allows the differentiation of functional and scar-fixed stenoses both in the small intestine and the colon. Since Crohns disease can affect all sections of the gastrointestinal tract, a relatively large section of the GI tract can be inspected with this procedure and a sensitive diagnostics can be provided. Endoscopic procedures allow an insight into the duodenum with an <b>esophago-gastroduodenoscopy</b> and into the terminal ileum within an ileo-coloscopy procedure. If necessary a push endoscopy is able to visualize additional small intestinal areas. As a matter of principle, however, one part of the small intestine remains concealed and a diagnostic gap remains as such. The MR-Sellink, however, is able to fill this gap in the same way as conventional investigation of the small intestine according to Sellink. Capsular endoscopy, i. e. the investigation of the small intestine using a swallowable small camera, is a modern procedure for endoluminal imaging of the small intestine. The camera takes two pictures per second and is able in this way to examine approx. five meters of the intestine within two to four hours. This procedure for the first time is able to depict the small intestinal lumen in real time in a video recording. The examination is, however, dependent on the degree of intestinal peristalsis so that with a slow peristalsis and a slow excursion of the capsule a relatively good illustration of the lumen can be provided, but with a strong peristalsis a rapid excursion of the camera occurs with a suboptimal and incomplete depiction. The localization of the camera as well as the assignment of the acquired images is achieved by triangulating the camera, i. e. with the help of two antennae in two dimensions so that an approximate conveyance of the anatomical region in which the camera was lying while taking the picture can be achieved. The kind of precise anatomic assignment and clear representation of the small intestine achievable in the MR-Sellink procedure is not of course possible. The basic problem with the camera is that it can only be applied if a relevant stenosis of the small intestine is previously excluded, which requires either a conventional small intestinal representation according to Sellink or the implementation of an MR-Sellink beforehand. The measurement of inflammatory activity in inflammatory intestinal disorders using MRT: here we present a procedure for the quantitative recording of inflammatory activity in Crohns disease. Using MRT, apart from morphological information about the inflammation affected intestinal section, objective statements can also be made about inflammatory activity by determining the amount of contrast medium absorbed into the wall-thickened intestinal section. Several already published studies show a positive correlation between the maximum percentage CM absorption of the intestinal wall and the clinical and laboratory parameter-based CDAI Crohn index. We were able to confirm a significant correlation between the percentage absorption of contrast medium and the coloscopically determined extent of inflammation. Unlike other studies published up until now, we did not employ the quotient of the results from the inflamed and normal intestinal wall sections from the same data acquisition after intravenous contrast medium application, but rather the values from identical locations on the intestinal wall before and after intravenous contrast medium application in order to quantitatively assess the contrast medium uptake into the intestinal wall. Since according to our experience the vascularization of the intestine can be regionally different even within the same examination sequence, we expect more precise results with our procedure for measuring identical positions before and after contrast medium application [...] This procedure together with the above described morphological diagnostic criteria can provide additional inflammation particularly about the floridity of an inflammatory intestinal process. Apart from morphological criteria that suggest either a functional or scarredinflammation-dependent stenosis, the therapeutic decision either in the direction of a conservative or surgical procedure can also be influenced by an objective determination of the extent of inflammation as a further criterion. Up until now the inflammatory activity of an intestinal segment could only be estimated either by using endoscopically obtained visual intestinal mucosa findings or using endoscopically obtained histological biopsies. The NMR-based procedures can therefore be considered as complementary to endoscopic procedures as non-invasive diagnostic procedures for the objective determination of inflammatory activity and may indeed represent an alternative to MR-Sellink with dynamic visualization in future: the MRT-Sellink is also able to depict the folding relief and stenoses as well as extraluminal processes just as well as conventional screening examinations following the Sellink procedure [...] Because of the above described dynamic assessibility with continuous fluid application, the combination examination of MR-Sellink and colonic MRT and the objectively quantifiable contrast medium kinetics of the intestinal wall for measuring inflammatory activity offer considerable benefits over the conventional Sellink enteroclysma procedure. Apart from the important examination criteria of palpation, MRT also lacks the ability to visualize intestinal peristalsis over time. Here, as an extension to the diagnostic options available, we present for the first time an examinational technique with which intestinal peristalsis can be visualized over a period of almost three and a half minutes. During this period, in a rapid T 1 -weighted gradient echo sequence with three neighboring parallel coronally directed layers of 8 mm thickness set 2 cm apart, 150 images are acquired per layer (i. e. 450 in all). Using this sequence we can depict intestinal peristalsis within a cinematographic loop. This additional functional information completes the spectrum of capabilities of the MR-Sellink as well as the combination examination of dynamic MR-Sellink and MR colonography. With the exception of palpation, all modalities possible with conventional small intestinal contrast representation according to Sellink are therefore available. These additional options, including the objectification of the extent of inflammation using quantitatively registered parameters and the visualization of peristalsis, shall in combination with the very good anatomical representation and the high soft-tissue contrast be able to render it an important diagnostic tool for small intestinal diagnostics. This tool shall extend beyond the possibilities of endoscopic procedures and at the same time outdo conventional small intestinal examinations following Sellinks procedure regarding diagnostic quality, also managing this without the need for applying any ionizing radiation. As a diagnostic algorithm for inflammatory intestinal diseases we suggest that after clinical and laboratory examinations and also after conventional endoscopy of the upper and lower GI tract with histological biopsies, the implementation of an MR-Sellink or the combination of an MR-Sellink with an MR-colonoscopy should follow as a complementary procedure to allow the detection of additional inflammatory manifestations in the small intestine or even extra-intestinal manifestations. Possible stenoses of the small intestine can in this way be excluded in order to decide whether a capsular endoscopy should also be carried out. Regarding the exclusive application of an MR-Sellink or the combination with an MR-colonoscopy as part of a therapeutic follow-up where endoscopic examinations are refused, this should be a matter only for the gastroenterologist to decide upon. The expansion of the diagnostic spectrum for diseases of the GI Tract using the described sectional imaging procedures shall serve to optimize the diagnostics of the abdomen and particularly the intestine and shall also certainly grow in importance within the therapeutic decision-making process. These techniques shall be applied either as complementary procedures or shall even replace older examination procedures in the future. Further studies should be carried out to determine their true value...|$|E
