25|$|Virgil {{refers to}} a Roman superstition (vulgo) that elms were trees of ill-omen because their fruit seemed to be of no value. It has been noted that two elm-motifs have arisen from {{classical}} literature: (1) the 'Paradisal Elm' motif, arising from pastoral idylls and the elm-and-vine theme, and (2) the 'Elm and Death' motif, perhaps arising from Homer's commemorative elms and Virgil's Stygian Elm. Many references to elm in European literature from the Renaissance onwards <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> or other of these categories.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, when {{automobiles}} were still new technology, their production levels were low {{enough that they}} could be shipped in sufficient quantities in boxcars. Two to four automobiles would usually <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> boxcar. But as the automobile industry grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends.|$|E
25|$|Anhemitonic pentatonic scales can be {{constructed}} in many ways. The major pentatonic scale may {{be thought of as}} a gapped or incomplete major scale. However, the pentatonic scale has a unique character and is complete in terms of tonality. One construction takes five consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Transposing the pitches to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> octave rearranges the pitches into the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, A.|$|E

25|$|R. C. Zaehner distinguishes three {{fundamental}} {{types of}} mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism. The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the Bhagavad Gita. The monistic type, {{which according to}} Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul, includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as Samhya and Advaita vedanta. Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of these two categories.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis {{had also}} been {{mentioned}} in the Jon Pertwee serial The Dæmons (1971), with the godlike being Azal citing its destruction as a warning of an experiment gone wrong. Some have argued that The Underwater Menace and The Time Monster depict the flooding and collapse, respectively, of different parts of Atlantis, not {{the destruction of the}} whole, so that all three accounts may <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> coherent narrative. Alternatively, and since the geographical and temporal locations seem to be at odds, the name 'Atlantis' may be taken as a translation convention – via the Time Lord gift that always translates local languages for the Doctor and his companions (and viewers) – referring to different lost prehistoric civilisations. The novel The Quantum Archangel suggests that the Daemons gave the Kronos crystal to the Atlanteans as a test, which they failed.|$|E
500|$|Halo {{had never}} been planned as a trilogy, but with the {{critical}} and commercial success of Combat Evolved, a sequel was expected. Bungie writer and cinematic director Joseph Staten recalled that during Combat Evolveds development, Bungie [...] "certainly had strong ideas for extending the story and gameplay experience that we knew we couldn't <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> game". The added publisher support for a sequel allowed greater leeway {{and the ability to}} return to more ambitious ideas lost during Combat Evolveds development.|$|E

500|$|The size of {{the city}} blocks in Gulfton differs {{significantly}} from that of Downtown Houston in that sixteen downtown city blocks will <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> Gulfton block. Few sidewalks exist in Gulfton. In 1999 Houston City Council District F representative Ray Discroll said [...] " [...] don't have sidewalks, let alone sidewalks that are only {{two and a half}} feet wide.

Those {{who have}} drama after drama {{and those who}} muddle through life, often in the background, as sturdy and dependable as the famous cobbles. Betty falls into the latter group. There have been moments of drama, intrigue and even romance – {{but it has been}} her presence behind the bar, cutting up pieces of lamb and chunks of potato, that has endeared her to the viewers."

2500|$|In 1634, Borromini {{received}} {{his first major}} independent commission to design [...] the church, cloister [...] and monastic buildings of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (also known as San Carlino). Situated on the Quirinal Hill in Rome, the complex was designed for the Spanish Trinitarians, a religious order. The monastic buildings and the cloister were completed first after which construction of the church {{took place during the}} period 1638-1641 and in 1646 it was dedicated to San Carlo Borromeo. The church is {{considered by many to be}} an exemplary masterpiece of Roman Baroque architecture. San Carlino is remarkably small given its significance to Baroque architecture; it has been noted that the whole building would <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of the dome piers of Saint Peter's.|$|E
2500|$|The anthropological social {{sciences}} often develop nuanced descriptions {{rather than the}} general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on {{one or more of}} these domains. Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: archaeology, physical or biological anthropology, anthropological linguistics, and cultural anthropology. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word anthropos (άνθρωπος) is from the Greek for [...] "human being" [...] or [...] "person". Eric Wolf described sociocultural anthropology as [...] "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences".|$|E

2500|$|As long as {{a romance}} novel meets those twin criteria, it can be set in any time period and in any location. There are no {{specific}} restrictions on what can or cannot {{be included in a}} romance novel. Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability. The combination of time frame, location, and plot elements does, however, help a novel to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of several romance subgenres. Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows, many people in the mainstream press claim that [...] "all [...] seem to read alike." [...] Stereotypes of the romance genre abound. For instance, some believe that all romance novels {{are similar to those of}} Danielle Steel, featuring rich, glamorous people traveling to exotic locations. Many romance readers disagree that Steel writes romance at all, considering her novels more mainstream fiction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Voigt {{was removed}} from the role of Ariadne at the Royal Opera House when she could not <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of the costumes, a [...] "little black dress."

She was replaced by Anne Schwanewilms, a German singer of slimmer appearance. She was [...] "very angry" [...] about the incident, but kept silent about it for several months. When the decision became public, the Royal Opera House received significant criticism in the media. It was pointed out that many notable sopranos, such as the Italian Luisa Tetrazzini, American Jessye Norman and English Jane Eaglen, had been [...] "large-boned, the , even the enormous", and Voigt had merely [...] "followed in their heavy footsteps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other monarchies. Five monarchies do not <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> of {{the above}} groups by virtue of {{geography}} or class of monarchy: the Kingdom of Tonga [...] in Polynesia; the Kingdom of Swaziland and the Kingdom of Lesotho in Africa; the Vatican City State; the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Europe. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Swaziland and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Swaziland is also unique among these monarchies, often being considered a diarchy. The King, or Ngwenyama, rules alongside his mother, the Ndlovukati, as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which more or less has become symbolic in recent years.|$|E
