50|$|Note: The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not — {{as the name}} suggests — a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e., slipping), the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers all the power to the other wheel.|$|R

A 2.4-liter and a 3.0-liter V6 petrol or gasoline engine with 12 or 24 valves, each with 4 gears and overdrive.

50|$|The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not - {{as the name}} suggests - a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor both roadwheel speeds across a driven axle, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers the torque to the other driven wheel which is deemed to still have grip.|$|R
5000|$|The US {{versions}} of the Lancer Evolution IX did not come with the AYC but the ACD was still present. The drivers can select from three different driving modes, [...] "Tarmac", [...] "Gravel" [...] and [...] "Snow", and the car's computer system relatively promotes the active center differential to change the <b>differential</b> <b>locking</b> which, despite popular belief, {{does not change the}} torque split. The differential is geared at 50:50 and cannot be changed by the push of a button. What this switch actually does is quite simple. Each setting determines how long the ACD will delay in freeing the center differential after a steering input is made. In addition, it will determine how much locking force the ACD will exhibit on the clutch pack and center differential.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{standard}} WRX, {{the third generation}} model was shortened to [...] "Subaru WRX STI", with the Japanese markets notably abstaining from this convention. To differentiate the STI from the regular WRX, Subaru opted to manufacture the STI with a wider body and therefore track—as noted by the flared wheel arches. Furthermore, Subaru utilized aluminum suspension components for the STI. Electronic modifications include a multi-mode electronic stability control with [...] "normal", [...] "traction", and [...] "off" [...] modes; Subaru Intelligent-Drive (SI-Drive) with three modes: [...] "intelligent", [...] "sport", and [...] "sport sharp"; and multi-mode driver controlled center differential (DCCD). The DCCD is a combined mechanical and solenoid operated limited-slip differential which enables the driver to switch between manual and automated centre <b>differential</b> <b>locking.</b> The locking strength can vary from fully open to fully locked [...] with a 35/65 front/rear open torque bias.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-active differential, called MRF LSD (MagnetoRheological Fluid Limited Slip Differential) that allows to bias torque between the driving wheels. It {{is based on}} the magnetorheological (MR) fluid employment, that allows to change, in a controlled manner, the <b>differential</b> <b>locking</b> torque and, consequently, the torque bias ratio. The device is an adaptive one and allows to obtain an asymmetric torque distribution in order to improve vehicle handling. The device modelling and the control algorithm, realized for this activity, are described. The illustrated results highlight the advantages that are attainable regarding directional behaviour, stability and traction for a front wheel drive (FWD) vehicle. A comparison with a traditional passive limited slip differential has been conducted...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{off-road}} vehicles {{are equipped with}} a type of clutches referred to as differential locks. A driver may engage/disengage these locks to switch between two distinct operating modes: the closed mode is charac- terized by greater off-road traversability, while the open mode allows better manueverability. Many drivers lack the education and experience required to correctly judge the terrain ahead of the vehicle and therefore engage/disengage the locks in a suboptimal fashion. An automatic <b>differential</b> <b>locking</b> strategy is hence desired. This paper compares three such traction control algorithms of the on/off variety, all derived from the same underlying kinematic vehicle model but each relying {{on the availability of}} different output signals. The validity of the kinematic model and the algorithms’ sensitivity to the values assumed by a couple of unobservable states, the wheel slip angles, is in- vestigated by comparison to an existing articulated hauler model in ADAMS— an environment for simulation of multibody dynamics.
