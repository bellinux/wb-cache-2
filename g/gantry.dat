5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a <b>gantry</b> spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the <b>gantry</b> {{to rest on the}} LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the <b>gantry</b> be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based <b>gantry</b> cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern <b>gantry</b> cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the <b>gantry</b> area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and <b>gantry.</b> Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the <b>gantry,</b> which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E

5|$|Ferry {{implementation}} required {{permission from}} several entities. Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT {{was required to}} approve a new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was supposed to give NYC Ferry permission to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at <b>Gantry</b> Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the <b>Gantry</b> Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E
5|$|The area {{housing the}} {{machinery}} {{to drive the}} wheel {{is located in the}} final pillar of the aqueduct, and contains seven chambers connected by ladders. Access is by a door located at ground level or an entrance halfway up the tower with a <b>gantry</b> crane to facilitate the installation of equipment.|$|E

They found that one underpass, placed on a commuting route, was used by 96% of bats, but few bats used the other underpasses and <b>gantries,</b> preferring routes which {{put them in the}} path of traffic.|$|R
5|$|On 23 January 2004 four protesters {{climbed onto}} the <b>gantry</b> over the Tamar Bridge to {{highlight}} {{the work of the}} group Fathers 4 Justice who promote the rights of fathers in child custody disputes. The protest caused rush-hour tailbacks {{on both sides of the}} bridge. Charges against the protesters were later dropped after it was felt there would not be a realistic chance of conviction.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} {{greatest}} operational efficiency, ML constructed two dedicated container terminals {{with their own}} <b>gantry</b> cranes, spreaders etc. The Manchester terminal was built on an open site next to {{the western end of}} No. 9 Dock. A second container berth was added in 1972. The other terminal was created at Montreal, with similar equipment, where the containers were trans-shipped to a dedicated liner train operated by Canadian National Railways, which carried them onwards to Toronto and further destinations.|$|E
5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber <b>gantry</b> had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day, May 5, 2012, Shackleford raced in the $400,000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes {{at seven}} furlongs on the dirt. In that race, he beat the favorite, American Champion Sprint Horse Amazombie, by a length. The two horses {{separated}} {{themselves from the}} rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. <b>Gantry</b> was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television <b>gantry,</b> {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand, {{which can}} seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which runs around {{two-thirds of the}} pitch. It {{contains}} the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners to either side, {{one of which is}} where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens to either side. At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers. Opposite is the Popular Stand, a covered all-seated stand, which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television <b>gantry</b> on its roof. It can seat 1,652 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television <b>gantry</b> is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead <b>gantry</b> with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} {{that had to be}} adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and <b>gantry</b> cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E

5|$|The station's track layout was rearranged in 1883 with {{platform}} extensions, a fifth {{platform for}} use by the Blackwall services and a new <b>gantry</b> signal box (which lasted until the 1935 re-modelling). The GER used the station as an alternative to Liverpool Street station during the late-19th and early-20th centuries for former ECR routes. The GER took over operation of the NLR shuttle from Bow in 1869, which it operated until April 1892 when the second Bow Road railway station opened along with a passenger foot connection to the NLR station. Subsequent services into Fenchurch Street were operated by the GER and the LTSR, and three years later the viaduct from Stepney to Fenchurch Street was widened to accommodate a fourth track.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll <b>gantry</b> is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{stand at}} Turf Moor is the James Hargreaves Stand, which was opened in 1996 {{as part of}} a ground {{redevelopment}} project which saw two new stands built to replace the Longside and the Bee Hole End at a total cost of £5.3 million. When built it was named the North Stand, although it has its current name thanks to a six-figure sponsorship deal. The stand can accommodate 8,512 (+192 Corporate seats) spectators and was opened on 23 April 1996, replacing the Longside terrace. It runs parallel to the length of the pitch. The television <b>gantry</b> is located in the James Hargreaves Stand along with the media area, which is situated {{at the rear of the}} upper tier. The stand is the traditional seating area of the Suicide Squad, who had previously stood in the Longside until the terrace was demolished in 1995. In the space between the upper and lower tiers of the James Hargreaves Stand there is a corporate area, which apart from being used for matchday hospitality is used for functions and events. Both the suite and the home dressing room, is licensed to hold civil marriage services.|$|E

50|$|The system {{enforcement}} {{is based on}} 300 <b>gantries</b> equipped with infrared detection equipment and high-resolution cameras (able to identify the license plates of lorries). Owing to the large volume of data generated by these <b>gantries,</b> {{not all of the}} <b>gantries</b> installed are in operation at the same time. Only selected <b>gantries</b> are in operation and able to identify vehicles for which the toll has not been paid. In addition Federal Officers of Freight in 300 mobile enforcement vehicles patrol the motorways and are authorized to pull lorries over and check for payment records. If a fee has not been paid and the GPS data is unclear a charge for 500 km of travel is imposed. The collection costs are estimated at 20 per cent of gross revenues. During the first eight months of operation of the scheme 11.6 million lorries were checked for violation, with a resulting violation rate of less than 2% (Richards, 2006; UK Commission for Integrated Transport, 2007).|$|R
