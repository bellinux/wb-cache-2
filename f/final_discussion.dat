500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a <b>final</b> <b>discussion</b> in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E
2500|$|Final Boardroom - The {{candidates}} at this stage, {{dubbed the}} [...] "final three", face a <b>final</b> <b>discussion</b> with Lord Sugar and his advisers, {{in which they}} argue their case for remaining in the process, with discussions often including feedback on their performance as a whole by the stage at which they are at within the process, {{their relationship with the}} other candidates, and any other criticism put towards them, with the candidates usually asked on who they feel should be fired based upon what has been discussed. After summarising the arguments and his own thoughts, Lord Sugar eventually fires a candidate by pointing his finger at them and proclaiming to them [...] "You're fired!", voicing his reasons for doing so beforehand, thus eliminating them from the competition; he may repeat this again, if another candidate is deemed by him as having no further potential to continue in the process. While the surviving candidates are sent back to the candidates' accommodation, the fired candidate(s) depart via a waiting taxi and taken on [...] "home", conducting a brief interview to reflect on their elimination during the [...] "journey".|$|E

I have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I was quite convinced that the letter from Meiringen was a hoax, and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow.

60|$|Concluding Remarks.--That {{these animals}} are true Cirripedes, though having so {{different}} an external appearance from others of the class, admits of not the least doubt. The prehensile antennæ, enveloped in cement and including the two cement-ducts, would have been amply sufficient, without other parts--for instance, the mouth, by itself perfectly characteristic with each organ, together with the whole alimentary canal, constructed on the normal plan,--to have proved that they were Cirripedia. Under {{the head of the}} closely-allied Ibla quadrivalvis, we shall, moreover, see that the males are developed from larvæ, having every point of structure--the peculiar quasi-bivalve shell, the two compound eyes, the six natatory legs, &c.,--characteristic of the Order. But in some respects, the males are in an embryonic condition, though unquestionably mature, as shown by the spermatozoa;--thus, in the thorax and mouth opening throughout their whole width into the cavity of the peduncle, that is, homologically into the anterior part of the head, and in the viscera being there lodged instead of in the thorax and prosoma, there is a manifest resemblance to the larva in its last stage of development: the absence of a probosciformed penis, the spineless peduncle, the food being obtained without the aid of cirri, and the length of the rectum, are likewise embryonic characters. Not only are these males, as just remarked, Cirripedia; but they manifestly belong to the Pedunculated Family. If a specimen had been brought to me to class, without relation to its sexual characters, I should have placed it, without any hesitation, next to the genus Ibla; if the mouth alone had been brought, I should assuredly have placed it actually in the genus Ibla: for let it be observed how nearly all the parts resemble those of Ibla Cumingii, excepting only in size and in being less hairy. The trophi are arranged in the same peculiar position as in the female; the labrum is largely bullate, without teeth on the crest; the palpi, though relatively smaller, are of the same shape; so are the mandibles; the maxillæ are more rounded and less prominent, but have the same exact size relatively to the mandibles; the outer maxillæ have the same, quite peculiar pointed outline, and the olfactory orifices are tubular, and hold the same unusual position. It is most rare to find so close a resemblance in the parts of the mouth, except in very closely allied genera, and often species of the same natural genus differ more. Again, in the long oesophagus and constricted stomach there is a resemblance to Ibla. In the male of Ibla quadrivalvis, the caudal appendages are multi-articulate; now, this is a character confined to four genera, namely, Ibla, Alepas, Pollicipes, and Lithotrya. I may add, that large tubular olfactory orifices are confined to the same genera, together with Scalpellum. Lastly, it particularly deserves notice, that the prehensile antennæ, in having a hoof-like and pointed disc, with a single spine on the heel, much more closely resemble these organs in Scalpellum, certainly the nearest ally of Ibla, than in any other genus; they differ from the antennæ in Scalpellum, only in the ultimate segment not having a notch on one side. These organs, unfortunately for the sake of comparison, were not found in the female and ordinary form of Ibla. The full importance of the above generic resemblance in the antennæ, will hereafter be more clearly seen, when their classificatory value is shown in the <b>final</b> <b>discussion</b> on the sexual relations of Ibla and Scalpellum.|$|E
