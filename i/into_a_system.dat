5|$|In 1634 King Charles I reorganized {{the colony}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of shires. The former Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire. After persuading 105 people {{to settle in}} the colony, Adam Thoroughgood (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King's Lynn, Norfolk, England) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the Lynnhaven River in 1636.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Edward T. Foote II {{became the}} school's fourth president. Under Foote's leadership, on campus student housing was {{converted}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of residential colleges. In addition, Foote initiated a five-year $400million fundraising campaign {{that began in}} 1984 and raised $517.5million. He saw the endowment expand from $47.4million in 1981 to $465.2million in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E

5|$|The {{limestone}} {{used for}} construction was local and quarried on-site. The depressions {{formed by the}} extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs, together with some waterproofed natural depressions. The main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of canals that fed the reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, UPCA {{requested}} Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos {{to allow}} the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years, while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.|$|E

25|$|The central {{concept of}} {{thermodynamics}} {{is that of}} energy, {{the ability to do}} work. By the First Law, the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In mechanics, for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.|$|E

25|$|The Local Government Act 1888 had divided England and Wales <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{of county}} councils and county boroughs. Under the Act any {{municipal}} borough could, on reaching {{a population of}} 50,000, apply to become a county borough, independent of the county council. Carlisle made a successful application in 1913, and on 1 April 1914 became a county borough, for its own area taking over the functions of Cumberland County Council. The county borough boundaries were enlarged in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} a vacancy chain {{is the number of}} moves a vacancy makes after its {{entrance}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system,</b> and this includes the terminal move to the absorbing state. Longer chains and more costly resource units generate greater benefits,while shorter chains and less costly units generate smaller benefits, for the individuals and institutions involved. Vacancy chains have patterned effects upon other individuals and, in the human case, institutions connected to the primary individuals actually getting resources in the chains.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} trace a vacancy chain, a {{researcher}} notes a vacancy coming <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> and then follows this vacancy {{as it moves}} {{to a number of}} resource units in turn and then finally leaves the system. Since vacancy chains in humans often take considerable periods of time, on the order of months, to move from beginning to end and because the chains often involve people widely scattered geographically, researchers usually trace the chains by reconstructing them from organizational records or from series of linked interviews.|$|E

25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Confucius, {{also known as}} Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed {{in favor of the}} Legalists during the Qin Dynasty. Following the victory of Han over Chu after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction and were further developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> known in the West as Neo-Confucianism, and later New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism).|$|E
25|$|Over {{a quarter}} of Southern white men of {{military}} age—the backbone of the South's white workforce—died during the war, leaving countless families destitute. Per capita income for white southerners declined from $125 in 1857 {{to a low of}} $80 in 1879. By the end of the 19th century and well into the 20th century, the South was locked <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of poverty. How much of this failure was caused by the war and by previous reliance on agriculture remains the subject of debate among economists and historians.|$|E
25|$|To {{defend against}} V-1s {{falling in the}} city and dock area, the British and US guns had to be {{positioned}} at least 10 miles outside the city (codenamed the Nylen Belt), integrated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. No 1 Identification Troop and No 2 Local Warning (Radar) Troop were formed by 80 AA Bde for this purpose, manned by the Royal Signals and 114th LAA Rgt respectively. This 'Antwerp X' defence deployment took its full form in December 1944, in time for the peak in V-1 attacks that lasted into February 1945.|$|E
