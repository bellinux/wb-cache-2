40|$|Summary 1. Over {{the last}} 30 years, many {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on the dynamics of bacteria and organic matter in the Breitenbach, a first-order stream in central Germany. The data now available allow a synthesis {{of the role of}} bacteria in the carbon budget, {{as an example of the}} general importance of bacteria in stream ecosystems. 2. Comparing measured and estimated inputs and outputs to the ecosystem, the organic matter budget of the Breitenbach is fairly balanced: 1. 84 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ (sum of inputs) versus 1. 88 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ (sum of outputs). No major missing link remains. 3. The basis of the food web in the Breitenbach is mainly allochthonous organic matter (dissolved and particulate 1. 02 and 0. 42 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹, respectively). Autochthonous gross primary production is 0. 4 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹. Most of the organic matter leaves the stream via transport to the River Fulda (dissolved and particulate 0. 74 and 0. 34 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹, respectively), the rest by respiration (0. 80 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ or 43 % of total outputs). 4. Bacteria constitute an important part (36 %) of heterotrophic biomass (average: 0. 004 <b>kg</b> m⁻² bacterial <b>C</b> of 0. 011 kg m⁻² total heterotrophic C). Bacteria also account for the major fraction (71 %) of heterotrophic production: 0. 20 of 0. 28 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ total heterotrophic production. Bacterial production in the Breitenbach is similar in magnitude to the estimate of photoautotrophic net primary production: both approximately 0. 20 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹. 5. Protozoa, the main consumers of bacteria in the Breitenbach, consume approximately one-third of bacterial production (0. 07 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹). Small metazoa (meiofauna, 0. 5 mm) consume approximately 10 % of bacterial production. Although this is a considerable amount of the carbon resources needed by the macrofauna (0. 02 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ of bacterial production versus 0. 06 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹ macrofauna production plus respiration), the carbon demand of the macrofaunal community is met to a larger extent by particulate organic matter than by bacteria. 6. Bacteria are the main decomposers in the Breitenbach. They account for 78 % of heterotrophic respiration (0. 47 of 0. 60 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹) and 59 % of total respiration (0. 47 of 0. 80 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m⁻² year⁻¹) ...|$|R

40|$|In the boreal region, soil {{organic carbon}} (OC) {{dynamics}} are strongly {{governed by the}} interaction between wildfire and permafrost. Using a combination of field measurements, numerical modeling of soil thermal dynamics, and mass-balance modeling of OC dynamics, we tested the sensitivity of soil OC storage to a suite of individual climate factors (air temperature, soil moisture, and snow depth) and fire severity. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the combined effects of fire-soil moisture interactions and snow seasonality on OC storage. OC losses were calculated as the difference in OC stocks after three fire cycles (~ 500 yr) following a prescribed step-change in climate and/or fire. Across single-factor scenarios, our findings indicate that warmer air temperatures resulted in the largest relative soil OC losses (~ 5. 3 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 ), whereas dry soil conditions alone (in the absence of wildfire) resulted in the smallest carbon losses (~ 0. 1 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 ). Increased fire severity resulted in carbon loss of ~ 3. 3 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 , whereas changes in snow depth resulted in smaller OC losses (2. 1 – 2. 2 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 ). Across multiple climate factors, we observed larger OC losses than for single-factor scenarios. For instance, high fire severity regime associated with warmer and drier conditions resulted in OC losses of ~ 6. 1 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 , whereas a low fire severity regime associated with warmer and wetter conditions resulted in OC losses of ~ 5. 6 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 . A longer snow-free season associated with future warming resulted in OC losses of ~ 5. 4 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 . Soil climate was the dominant control on soil OC loss, governing the sensitivity of microbial decomposers to fluctuations in temperature and soil moisture; this control, in turn, is governed by interannual changes in active layer depth. Transitional responses of the active layer depth to fire regimes also contributed to OC losses, primarily by determining the proportion of OC into frozen and unfrozen soil layers...|$|R
40|$|The carbon {{reservoir}} of ecosystems was estimated based on field measurements for forests and peatlands on {{an area in}} Finland covering 263 000 km 2 and extending about 900 km across the boreal zone from south to north. More than {{two thirds of the}} reservoir was in peat, and less than ten per cent in trees. Forest ecosystems growing on mineral soils covering 144 000 km 2 contained 10 – 11 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2 on an average, including both vegetation (3. 4 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2) and soil (uppermost 75 cm; 7. 2 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2). Mire ecosystems covering 65 000 km 2 contained an average of 72 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2 as peat. For the landscape consisting of peatlands, closed and open forests, and inland water, excluding arable and built-up land, a reservoir of 24. 6 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2 was observed. This includes the peat, forest soil and tree biomass. This is an underestimate of the true total reservoir, because there are additional unknown reservoirs in deep soil, lake sediments, woody debris, and ground vegetation. Geographic distributions of the reservoirs were described, analysed and discussed. The highest reservoir, 35 – 40 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m– 2, was observed in sub regions in central western and north western Finland. Many estimates given for the boreal {{carbon reservoir}}s have been higher than those of ours.

40|$|Knowledge on the {{quantity}} and dynamics of rhizodeposition under ecologically realistic conditions may elucidate various aspects of soil organic matter dynamics. Data from a field experiment with C- 14 pulse-labelling of spring wheat at different development stages, were used to estimate rhizosphere carbon fluxes. Not only the flux of C to the roots was assessed but also the fluxes of organic and inorganic release of root-derived material. C fluxes were calculated from curves fitted to data on shoot and root biomass and to data on C- 14 distribution at different development stages. The C- 14 distribution curves were extrapolated from the first labelling date (elongation stage) down to crop emergence and from the last labelling date (dough ripening stage) up to crop harvest, using different extrapolation procedures. The results show that while the maximum shoot growth rate occurred around ear emergence, the flux of C to the roots had a maximum around tillering. Over the entire growing season, shoot growth amounted to 5730 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1 and 2310 +/- 90 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1 was translocated belowground. Of this 920 +/- 150 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1 was lost in root respiration and 500 +/- 120 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1 was released as young photosynthate rhizodeposits, which are defined as organic materials released from the roots within 19 days after assimilation. Root growth amounted to 940 +/- 40 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1, of which, however, 370 +/- 40 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> ha- 1 was lost again through root decay. Root turnover during the growing season, defined as root decay divided by root growth, was therefore 37 - 42 %. Most of the organic input to soil (56 - 64 %) occurred through rhizodeposition, while 36 - 44 % was comprised in root biomass at crop harvest.

40|$|We {{examined}} the long-term dynamics of upland boreal forest floors after disturbance by fire. We selected two important and contrasting upland tree species, Pinus banksiana (jack pine) and Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), in three distinct climatic zones across the boreal forest of western Canada, and sampled 80 fire-originated stands divided into six chronosequences with ages ranging from 14 to 149 years. The forest floor {{was a large}} component of carbon storage. Averaged across ages and zones, it was 1. 31 and 2. 78 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 for P. banksiana and P. tremuloides, respectively, compared with 4. 03 and 5. 56 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2 in aboveground trees. These data exclude decomposing coarse woody debris, which was a significant component of the forest floor (0. 18 / 0. 13 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2) and requires further study. The contributions from shrubs (0. 035 / 0. 151 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2), ground vegetation (0. 019 / 0. 026 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2), and moss-plus-lichen (0. 179 / 0. 004 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m− 2) were relatively small. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model showed that forest floor carbon {{was positively related to}} stand age, as well as being affected by species and climatic zone. Much of the variability was explained by species, and species-specific regression models showed that for P. tremuloides forest floor carbon was strongly related to stand age, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation, and for P. banksiana, forest floor carbon was strongly related to an index of moss dominance. The regression models suggest that the forest floor carbon pool in upland forests of the western Canadian boreal will be sensitive to climate change, but this sensitivity would need to be tested with process-based models...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the changes in the soil carbon stocks as influenced by land use in a humid zone of Deylaman district (10, 876 ha), a mountainous region of northern Iran. For this, land use maps were produced from TM and ETM+ images for 1985, 2000 and 2010 years; and this was supplemented by field measurement of soil carbon in 2010. The results showed that the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) density was 6. 7 +/- 1. 8 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2), 5. 2 +/- 3. 4 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) and 3. 2 +/- 1. 8 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) for 0 - 20 cm soil layer and 4. 8 +/- 1. 9 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2), 3. 1 +/- 2 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) and 2. 7 +/- 1. 8 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) for 20 - 40 cm soil layer in forest, rangeland and cultivated land, respectively. During the past 25 years, 14. 4 % of the forest area had been converted to rangeland; and 28. 4 % of rangelands had been converted to cultivated land. According to the historical land use changes in the study area, the highest loss of SOC stocks resulted from the conversion of the forest to rangeland (0. 45 x 10 (4) Mg C in 0 - 40 cm depth layer); and the conversion of rangeland to cultivated land (0. 37 x 10 (4) Mg C in 0 - 40 cm), which typically led to the loss of soil carbon in the area studied. The knowledge on the historical land use changes and its influence on overall SOC stocks could be helpful for making management decision for farmers and policy managers in the future, for enhancing the potential of C sequestration in northern Iran...|$|R

40|$|To {{accurately}} estimate soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) storage in upper alpine to nival zones on the Tibetan Plateau, we inventoried SOC pools in 0 - 0. 3 m profiles along an altitudinal gradient (4400 - 5300 m asl). We also studied vegetation properties and decomposition activity along the gradient to {{provide insight into}} the mechanisms of SOC storage. The vegetation cover and belowground root biomass showed a gradual increased with altitude, reaching a peak in the upper alpine zone at 4800 - 4950 m before decreasing in the nival zone at 5200 - 5300 m. Decomposition activity was invariant along the altitudinal gradient except in the nival zone. SOC pools at lower sites were relatively small (2. 6 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m^ at 4400 m), but increased sharply with altitude, reaching a peak in the upper alpine zone (4950 m; 13. 7 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m^) before decreasing (1. 0 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m^ at 5300 m) with altitude in the nival zone. SOC pool varied greatly within individual alpine meadows by a factor of five or more, as did bulk density, partly due to the effect of grazing. Inventory data for both carbon density and bulk density along altitudinal gradients in alpine ecosystems are of crucial importance in estimating global tundra SOC storage. チベット高原の高山帯上部から植生限界（標高 4400 m‐ 5300 m) において、深度 30 cmまでの土壌圏有機炭素(SOC) プールの測定を行った。また綿シートを用いて標高傾度に伴う分解活性の差異を検討した。低標高ではSOCプールは小さく（ 2. 6 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m- 2, 4400 ｍ）、標高が上がるにつれて増加して 4950 ｍで最大（ 13. 7 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m- 2 ）となった。分解活性は植生限界である 5200 － 5300 mを除くと、ほとんど変化しなかった。標高のわずかな違いによってSOCプールや仮比重は大きく変動し、高山ツンドラでのSOCプールの推定において標高傾度に伴う調査が重要であることが示唆された...|$|R

40|$|A typical {{feature of}} the boreal forest {{landscape}} is a gradient from dry to wet sites, with associated increases in {{the depth of the}} soil organic layers. In this study, the coupled ecosystem-soil biogeochemistry model GUESS-ROMUL is used to explore how the specific features of soil organic matter decomposition and vegetation dynamics account for an observed difference between the soils formed under contrasting moisture conditions. Two sites, one mesic and one mesic-to-wet, representative of the natural forest in Northern Sweden, are simulated. In addition to the assumptions underlying the GUESS-ROMUL model, it is assumed that the fire frequency was higher at the mesic site. The model shows that with a natural fire regime, the soil organic layers at the mesic-to-wet site store 6. 0 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) compared to 3. 1 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) at the mesic site. Forty-seven percent of the difference between the sites in this respect is explained by suppressed decomposition under higher moisture conditions, 37 % by the decreased litter input into the soil (more frequently disturbed ecosystems have lower productivity) and 16 % by direct consumption of the forest floor in fires. It is predicted that due to anthropogenic fire suppression the organic soil layers of mesic sites will, in the future, sequester carbon at an average rate of 0. 0103 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) year(- 1) and have an equilibrium storage capacity of 5. 4 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2).

40|$|In {{most studies}} {{concerning}} the carbon (C) exchange between soil and atmosphere only the topsoil (0 - 0. 3 m) is taken into account. However, {{it has been}} shown that important amounts of stable soil organic carbon (SOC) are also stored at greater depth. Here, we developed a quantitative model to estimate the evolution of the distribution of SOC with depth between 1960 (database 'Aardewerk') and 2006 in northern Belgium. This temporal analysis was conducted under different land use, texture and drainage conditions. The results indicate that intensified land management practices seriously affect the SOC status of the soil. The increase in plough depth and a change in crop rotation result in a significant decrease of C near the surface for dry silt loam cropland soils, (i. e. 1. 02 +/- 0. 23 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m(- 2) in the top 0. 3 m between 1960 and 2006). In wet to extremely wet grasslands, topsoil SOC decreased significantly, indicating a negative influence of intensive soil drainage on SOC stock.

40|$|Rates of input, accumulation, and {{turnover}} of C differ markedly within soil profiles and in soils with different drainage in the BOREAS northern study area. Soil C storage increases from ∼ 3 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 in well-drained, sandy soils to greater than 100 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 in wetlands. Two modes of C accumulation {{were observed in}} upland soil profiles. Large annual C inputs (0. 06 - 0. 1 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 yr - 1) and slow decomposition (turnover times of 6 - 250 years) lead to rapid C accumulation in regrowing surface moss and detrital layers following fire. Deep organic layers that have accumulated over the millennia since the initiation of soil development, and are located below the most recent charred horizon, show slower rates of input (0. 015 - 0. 03 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 yr - 1) and turnover (100 - 1600 years) and accumulate C about 10 times slower than surface detrital layers. Rates of C input to soils derived from C and 14 C data were in accord with net primary production estimates, with highest rates of input (0. 14 - 0. 6 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 yr - 1) in wetlands. Turnover times for C in surface detrital layers were 6 - 15 years for well-drained sand soils that showed highest soil temperatures in summer, 30 - 40 years for wetlands, and 36 - 250 years for uplands with thick moss cover and black spruce trees. Long (> 100 years) turnover times in upland black spruce/clay soils most likely reflect the influence of woody debris incorporated into detrital layers. Turnover times for deep organic and mineral layer C were controlled by drainage, with fastest turnover (80 - 130 years) in well-drained sand soils and slowest turnover (> 3000 years) in wetlands. Total C accumulation rates, which account for C losses from both deep organic and surface detrital layers, are close to zero for sand/jack pine soils, 0. 003 - 0. 01 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 yr - 1 for moderately to poorly drained sites in mature forest stands, and 0. 03 <b>kg</b> <b>C</b> m - 2 yr - 1 for a productive fen. Decomposition of organic matter more than several decades old accounts for 9 - 22 % of total heterotrophic respiration at these sites. The rates of C accumulation derived here are decadal averages for specific stands and will vary as stands age or undergo disturbance. Extrapolation to larger regions and longer timescales, where burning offsets C gains in moss layers, will yield smaller rates of C storage...|$|R
