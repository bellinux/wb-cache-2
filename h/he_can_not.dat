5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family {{did not have enough}} food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he}} could buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E
5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of lifeâ€“one of many horses in the movie.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Daisy {{returns to}} New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of {{comparable}} physical age, they {{fall in love}} and go sailing together. They return to learn that Queenie has died, then move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, tells Benjamin that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a girl, Caroline, in the spring of 1968. Believing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be a proper father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, Benjamin departs after selling his belongings, leaving a bank account book holding the proceeds behind for Daisy and Caroline; he travels alone during the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it.

The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours â€“ we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E

After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen due to the crown princess's apparent death. The flier Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who explains how it is good Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth.

25|$|The Videocon Tri-Series was a three-team One Day International cricket tournament {{taking place}} in Zimbabwe between the hosts Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand. It started on 24 August 2005 and ended with the final on 6 September 2005, which New Zealand won by six wickets. Zimbabwe ended the tournament without a victory against a team other than rock-bottom Bangladesh for 35 ODI matches, since November 2003. Their last series win against a team other than Bangladesh or Kenya was, intriguingly, against New Zealand, in the 2000â€“01 season. India are still without a tournament win since March 2004, coming off an 18-run defeat by Sri Lanka in {{the final of the}} 2005 Indian Oil Cup, while New Zealand were {{comprehensively}} defeated 5â€“0 by Australia at home in their last series before this tournament. Before that, however, they were undefeated in six tournaments. The Supersub rule, which means that a player can be substituted for another at any time, but once the player is off <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> return, was introduced for this tournament. The stand-out performances came from Indian Mohammad Kaif, who hit 277 runs and was made Man of the Series, but Yuvraj Singh, and New Zealanders Stephen Fleming and Lou Vincent also passed 200 runs. On the bowling side, Shane Bond took 11 wickets at an average of just 8.63, despite being rested for one match, and Indian seamers Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar also got more than 10 wickets.|$|E
