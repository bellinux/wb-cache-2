500|$|The {{recording}} of the album was filmed {{as part of a}} career-spanning documentary called Back and Forth, which Grohl said was essential to make audiences understand the decision to record the album in his garage. The album name, taken from a lyric in [...] "Miss the Misery", was chosen by Grohl because [...] "it seemed to resonate with me: 'OK, that's what we're here doing'", as the band always [...] "recorded each album thinking it could be our last" [...] and tried to take the most of their tenure together—"we're only here for a short time, we're lucky to be alive, lucky to be a band; I don't take any of this for granted; I don't want to spend my time looking backwards, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forwards".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} {{phases of the}} show, Weinberg was {{involved}} in occasional comedy bits, but mostly focused on his musical responsibilities, including the selection of walk-on music for guests. The band got a 30-second featured spot each night after O'Brien's opening monologue. O'Brien often received poor notices {{during the early years}} of Late Night, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times pronounced the Max Weinberg 7 as the [...] "saving grace" [...] of the show. Weinberg established an image by dressing in high-quality suits and a tie; he said, [...] "I like us to look sharp and play sharp," [...] and [...] "I don't want to look like the audience, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> different." [...] Weinberg became a television celebrity, and his visibility and stature grew from Late Night and established an image for him beyond Springsteen. Indeed, much of the show's young fan base, and some of the staff on the show itself, were unaware of Weinberg's past role in the E Street Band.|$|E
500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some. Then I played Tommy a couple that I'd written, and he said, 'Whoa, that's a great idea,' so we selected a couple of those. [...] We all made suggestions, and we took all those suggestions to the studio." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cover art for {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by the poster to the 1965 film Mudhoney. Jones was recording the album at Danger Mouse's studio and saw the poster on the wall. She said, [...] "Brian has this great collection of Russ Meyer posters in his studio. And this particular one...was right over the couch where I sat every day. I always was looking at it and thinking 'that's so cool <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like her!' I remember staring at the poster the whole time we made the record. It's a great visual." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1872 and 1885, the King had 209 private {{performances}} (Separatvorstellungen) {{given for}} himself {{alone or with}} a guest, in the two court theaters, comprising 44 operas (28 by Wagner, including eight of Parsifal), 11 ballets, and 154 plays (the principal theme being Bourbon France) {{at a cost of}} 97,300 marks. This was not due so much to misanthropy but, as the King complained to the theatre actor-manager Ernst Possart: [...] "I can get no sense of illusion in the theatre so long as people keep staring at me, and follow my every expression through their opera-glasses. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> myself, not to be a spectacle for the masses." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, {{and what}} do you think about it now? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and think. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> every one <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and think.

60|$|I {{proposed}} {{that we should}} walk {{to the other end}} of the line, using the profaned name, not only without gusto, but with positive distaste. And this, too, was one of the wonders of Time, for a bare minute had worked that change. There was at the end of the line a certain street <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, <b>I</b> explained to my companion.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the lesson}} was over, I took {{advantage}} of the confusion caused by breaking up, to approach Mdlle. Henri; she was standing near the window and retired as I advanced; she thought <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out, and did not imagine that I could have anything to say to her.

40|$|Looking at Hebrew in Israel today, {{it is hard}} {{to believe}} that in a century Hebrew has gone from being a dead {{language}} with no native speakers to an active living language with over 5 million.

40|$|When it {{came time}} to contact my {{research}} subjects on the Orbiter and Lander projects, I made it clear that I wasn't interested in finger pointing and I wasn't <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> blame anyone for failures.

60|$|WE {{got down}} to Newnham, where the 'Sizes were held, {{on the morning of}} September 20th. There we {{discovered}} that we had an hour or two for refreshment, and I may say that both Philippa and I employed that time to the best advantage. While at the hotel I tried to obtain the file of the Times. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back and see if I could find the account of the magisterial proceedings against the truly unlucky William Evans.|$|R

5000|$|According to Jones, [...] "I was six when I first {{realised}} how hideous I looked", and she {{has been}} an anorexic since the age of about 11.

It [...] "wasn’t just a magazine to me, its cover was a mirror: how <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> dress and be". Jones studied journalism at the London College of Printing.|$|R

5000|$|Comstock and Republican U.S. Senate {{candidate}} Ed Gillespie {{planned on}} attending a public {{meeting of the}} Northern Shenandoah Valley Tea Party in early August 2014.
