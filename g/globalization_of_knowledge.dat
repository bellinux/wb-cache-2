We find that rare earth catalyst innovation activities expand globally, while rare earth magnet innovation activities become more clustered. We suggest this heterogeneous response is conditioned by the role of geographically constrained within value chain knowledge in technology knowledge production functions.

40|$|The {{competitive}} advantages in a knowledge-based economy {{can no longer}} be attributed to single nodes in the network. Political economies are increasingly reshaped by knowledge-based developments that upset market equilibria and institutional arrangements. The network coordinates the subdynamics of (i) wealth production, (ii) organized novelty production, and (iii) private appropriation versus public control. The interaction terms generate a complex dynamics which cannot be expected to contain central coordination. However, the <b>knowledge</b> infrastructure <b>of</b> systems of innovations can be measured, for example, in terms of universityindustry-government relations.

40|$|With the <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> companies, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> {{cultural}} differences and cognitive behavior are becoming very {{crucial for the}} design of systems. Time orientation, which categorizes behaviors as monochronic or polychronic, is potentially an important consideration as it can influence the manner in which an operator interacts with complex systems. Thus, systems and their design may have to accommodate these different behaviors. In this paper, the Modified Polychronic Attitude Index 3 (MPAI 3) and the Inventory of Polychronic Values (IPV) were used to evaluate the time orientation of Americans, Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong Chinese. The MPAI 3 as well as the IPV scales showed significant differences between Americans and Chinese, but no significant difference between Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong Chinese. The results also showed that a majority of Americans are polychronic while Hong Kong Chinese tend to show monochronic abilities. These results and their implications on interface design are discussed in this paper...|$|R

This latter trend is little affected by the boundaries between developed and less developed countries and is having a particular impact on trends in education. This article looks at the impact of globalization within the context of education in South Africa. It focuses on different perspectives of globalization and identifies key factors that may have an impact on education in South Africa. Finally, it argues that in order to respond to the dangers of marginalization posed by globalization it will be crucial to form, and be part of, new alliances and networks.

30|$|The {{increase}} in the number of MOOCs cannot be understood without taking into account the postmodern dynamics of the <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> culture and communication together with the rise of lifelong training programmes (Gómez Galán, 2014). Despite the rapid expansion of this phenomenon and the many advantages highlighted by several authors (such as Gómez Galán, 2014, or Valverde, 2014), some critical voices have noted the need to take into consideration the fact that although the use of the network provides a semblance of freedom, in the end it is an instrument under the control of the social and political elites. Therefore, it is a good idea to view it from a distance and analyze it without being seduced by its apparent novelty or the breakaway or revolutionary model it appears to represent (Gómez Galán, 2014; Silva-Peña, 2014; Vázquez et al., 2013).|$|E
40|$|In the era <b>of</b> <b>globalization,</b> sharing <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> information, and {{practices}} across cultural and national boundaries {{has been recognized}} {{as a key for}} handling the most critical problems. Consequently, the number <b>of</b> Transnational <b>Knowledge</b> Networks (TKNs) that aim to address critical global issues and problems continue to increase. As exchanging knowledge and information represent core components of these networks, this paper provides the foundations to study knowledge and information sharing in these emerging organizations. The paper starts by describing the structures, goals, and objectives of TKNs and presents a simplified conceptual model to demonstrate the main characteristics of these networks. Then, we review the pertinent e-government literature and argue the need to include findings from two additional research areas, cross-boundary information sharing and knowledge transfer. The paper discusses the ways in which contributions from these areas can enhance our understanding of the complexity surrounding the exchange process in these networks. The paper concludes with a summary of the elements of complexity and an overview of future research to empirically test these concepts...|$|R

40|$|The democratizing {{dimension}} of the new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) is a widely accepted proposition. Although this is repeatedly emphasized and explained by economic, political and social theories that deal with the analysis of the Information Society, a good deal of its significance has been systematically neglected.

However, the democratizing role of ICTs includes an aspect that is far less treated yet more relevant: its ability to provide a greater transparency in the political, economical and social management of societies.

40|$|EUROPEAN ROMANIA, BETWEEN PLEONASM AND OXYMORON Trivial approaches, so frequent, to „European Romania” oblige this syntagm to {{alternate}} its status between pleonasm and oxymoron. Both should be rejected. The kernel {{of the problem}} is that of identity and its relation to European integration. We argue that the latter makes stronger the former. We also argue that European integration should be a component of the globalization process. Besides the economic-social-political globalization, we have in view the <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> (cognitive globalization) and the globalization of the communication process. They lead to the cultural globalization, in absence of which no cultural identity can be developed and no European integration can be realized. Identity can be really understood only in correlation to alterity. There is a whole typology of identities, they are to some extent cooperative, to some extent conflictual. The example of the identities of the human body is discussed in the last part of this paper and its relevance for the identity of a nation is pointed out...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, ecocriticism {{has become}} one of the most visible and {{productive}} new directions of literary and cultural studies. Having originated in the United States as a minor, mostly regional form of environmentally oriented approach in the late 20 th century, it has since spread throughout literature departments, and become a successful new branch of the humanities not only in the U. S. and Europe but worldwide. At first, ecocriticism met with considerable resistance at first from a scholarly community that was deeply shaped by the theoretical fields of cultural studies, poststructuralism, and postmodernism 1. However, it has gained increasing recognition as an important new field of research and teaching that opens up a broad spectrum of new perspectives and that can help to reaffirm the relevance and responsibility of the humanities and of literary studies at a time when the process of globalization, and the concomitant <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and science, continue to be interpreted in primarily economic and technological terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of what comparative literature is remains, {{after many years of}} discussion, an unsolved problem, more urgent than ever in a time of multiculturalism, (post) colonialism, (post) ethnicity and the rise of cultural studies. In this paradoxical condition, the apparently inevitable <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> all <b>knowledge</b> clashes with the focus on the local and arguments of essential values collide with the decentralization of any unified system. Faced with this situation, the scholar who practices a comparative approach is torn out between the origins of the discipline, with its focus on the Western canon, more often as the result of an experience of exile, and the urge to popularise and open up the field. Thus, this paper explores the most recent discussions around this debate. Aware of the impossibility of fencing in the many and diverse elements that conform the field, these pages will try to expose the present state of affairs in the study of comparative literature...|$|R

40|$|To {{what extent}} has <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the world’s economy {{over the past}} decade {{reshaped}} the academic profession into a more internationalized one? This chapter compares the responses of faculty in ten nations to similar items on an international survey in 1992 and 2007 as well analyzing differences in the 2007 responses of faculty at different career stages. The results suggest that, with a few exceptions, national faculties are no more likely to recruit foreign-born academics than in the past, while the proportion of foreign-educated academics has grown slightly. Moreover, there is little evidence of a sharp upswing in international research collaboration or co-publication or in the internationalization of teaching. While the percentage of national faculties engaged internationally has not changed substantially between 1992 and 2007, the tremendous growth in the size of national academic professions means that much larger numbers of academics across the world are not engaged internationally in their professional work...|$|E

The paper draws on two analytical distinctions: Firstly, following Turner et al. (1990), systemic global change is distinguished from local or regional environmental change that becomes global by worldwide accumulation. Secondly, collaboration programmes that belong to the social system of science are distinguished from programmes at the intersection of scientific and political spheres. Both cases are compared in terms of their (a) rationales for international collaboration, (b) their organisational structure and fundings, (c) international participation and (d) linkages between problem structure and collaboration.
