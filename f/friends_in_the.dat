5|$|Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North. When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E

5|$|The {{scale of}} Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E
