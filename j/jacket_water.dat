50|$|A fourth {{blast furnace}} was {{installed}} in 1909 to treat the copper ore. A larger air-blowing machine also improved the copper smelting. A heavy duty horizontal compound condensing steam engine with duplex air cylinders could blow two converter stands at once. A new high pressure motor-driven air compressor supplied air to the pneumatic ram used for relining converter vessels. A DC generator was ordered for the motors and lighting. The ore sampling floor was doubled in capacity. A high-lift motor-driven centrifugal pump for pumping furnace <b>jacket</b> <b>water</b> was added. A new sample crushing office was attached with electric motors driving the pulverizers.Ore supplies locally were poor in 1910 and ore was scavenged across the Etheridge Goldfield to supply Chillagoe smelters. The roasting furnaces were supplied with all the Etheridge gold mine dumps, the copper smelters worked on sintered Havelock residues, along with Mungana copper-lead oxides and clean lead ores from the Lady Jane, Girofla and Etheridge mines. Overhead central flues were fitted over the copper and lead furnaces.|$|E

40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the Engineering Division of the Air Service of the United States Army, a Liberty- 12 engine has been tested at the Bureau of Standards. The program of tests was planned to yield that information considered most important in determining {{the value of the}} engine for aviation. Full power runs were made at the ground, at 25, 000 feet, and at several intermediate altitudes. To determine the mechanical efficiency of the engine, friction horsepower was measured at the ground and at 15, 000 feet. As a basis for predicting engine performance with a propeller, a series of tests was made in which the dynamometer load and engine throttle were adjusted at each speed to simulate the engine load which would be imposed at that speed by a propeller operating under normal full load at 1, 700 r. p. m. Among the quantities calculated from the test measurements are: brake horsepower; break mean effective pressure; fuel consumption; mixture ratio; mechanical, thermal, and volumetric efficiency; and the percentage of the heat in the fuel appearing in the <b>jacket</b> <b>water</b> and in the exhaust. <b>Jacket</b> <b>water</b> temperature, oil temperature, manifold pressure, etc., are recorded to show the conditions under which the test was made...|$|E

40|$|Renewable non-edible {{plant oils}} such as {{jatropha}} and karanj have potential to substitute fossil diesel fuels in CI engines. A multi-cylinder water cooled IDI type CI engine {{has been tested}} with jatropha and karanj oils and comparisons made against fossil diesel. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of the three fuels were measured to investigate the suitability of jatropha and karanj oils as fuels for CI engines. The engine cooling water circuit and fuel supply systems were modified such that hot <b>jacket</b> <b>water</b> preheated the neat plant oil prior to injection. Between jatropha and karanj there was little difference in the performance, emission and combustion results. Compared to fossil diesel, the brake specific fuel consumption on volume basis was around 3 % higher for the plant oils and the brake thermal efficiency was almost similar. Jatropha and karanj operation resulted in higher CO 2 and NO x emissions by 7 % and 8 % respectively, as compared to diesel. The cylinder gas pressure diagram showed stable engine operation with both plant oils. At full load, the plant oils gave around 3 % higher peak cylinder pressure than fossil diesel. With the plant oils, cumulative heat release was smaller at low load and almost similar at full load, compared to diesel. At full load, the plant oils exhibited 5 % shorter combustion duration. The study concludes that the IDI type CI engine can be efficiently operated with neat jatropha (or karanj) oil preheated by <b>jacket</b> <b>water,</b> after small modifications of the engine cooling and fuel supply circuits...|$|E
