5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin.</b> The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E
25|$|The African penguin is a banded penguin, {{placed in}} the genus Spheniscus. The other banded {{penguins}} are the African penguin's closest relatives, and are all found mainly in the Southern Hemisphere: the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> and Magellanic penguins found in southern South America, and the Galápagos penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. All are similar in shape, colour and behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{a declining}} {{population}} caused {{in part by}} over-fishing, climate change, and ocean acidification, {{the current status of}} the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> is threatened.

The current population is estimated at between 3,300 and 12,000. In August 2010 the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> of Chile and Peru, was granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.|$|E
