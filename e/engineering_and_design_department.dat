50|$|In September 1939, Sukhoi founded an {{independent}} <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>department</b> named Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB Sukhoi). Located in Kharkov, Sukhoi was {{not satisfied with}} the geographical location of the OKB, which was isolated from the scientific pole of Moscow, and he insisted that the OKB should relocate to the aerodrome of Podmoskovye. The relocation was completed {{in the first half of}} 1940. In the winter of 1942 Sukhoi encountered another problem — since he had no production line of his own he had nothing to do. He had developed a new ground-attack plane, the Su-6, but Stalin decided that this plane should not be put into production, favouring production of the Ilyushin Il-2.|$|E
50|$|The novel coupé {{body had}} a {{peculiar}} but highly aerodynamic shape, characterised by a flat, elongated roofline, an abruptly cut off tail, and some very modern traits like an uninterrupted fender line and smooth sides—a first on a Fiat.As the Mille Miglia model was developed mainly to help promote the new 508 C by competing in motor racing, the chassis {{had to be}} carried over from the saloon and couldn't be lowered or altered to reduce the frontal area. Therefore in order to up the car's top speed Fiat's Ufficio tecnico vetture (motor car <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>department,</b> headed by Dante Giacosa) had to optimise the body shape to lower its drag coefficient—even {{at the cost of}} sacrificing interior room and rear visibility.According to Giacosa inspiration for the sports coupé's body came from observing that during test runs a prototype 500 Topolino-based van could reach an higher top speed than the saloon it was based on. The shape of the body was then perfected using a number of 1:5 scale models and the wind tunnel of the Politecnico di Torino university.|$|E

He went to school from 1905 to 1914 at the [...] Gomel Gymnasium (now the Belarusian State University of Transport). In 1915 he went to the Imperial Moscow Technical School (today known as BMSTU). After World War I broke out, he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army; in 1920 he was demobilized because of {{health-related}} problems and {{he went back to the}} BMSTU, graduating in 1925. In 1925 he wrote his thesis named Single-engined Pursuit Aircraft of 300 hp under the direction of Andrei Tupolev. In March 1925 he started working as an engineer/designer with TsAGI (The Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute) and Moscow Factory Number 156. During the following years, Sukhoi designed and constructed aircraft including the record-setting Tupolev ANT-25 and the TB-1 and TB-3 heavy bombers. In 1932 he was appointed head of the <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>department</b> of TsAGI, and in 1938 he was promoted to head of the department of design.

40|$|This thesis report {{documents}} {{an investigation}} into the electrical <b>engineering</b> aspects <b>and</b> <b>design</b> considerations pertinent to the maritime industry and, in particular, to ship building. The investigation is a review of the electrical power systems of a 35 metre search and rescue (SAR) vessel <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed for the Philippines coast guard by BAE Systems at its Henderson shipbuilding facility in Perth, Western Australia. The purpose of reviewing the electrical systems of the 35 M vessel is to provide a platform from which future vessels of similar class, size and operational purpose can be designed. The electrical engineering design aspects include an introductory description of the rules for classification for which vessels are constructed and in particular that of the 35 M SAR vessel and the structure of project management and the interrelationships between different <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>departments</b> which are involved in the 35 M SAR shipbuilding process. The re-validation of the electrical engineering systems includes the use of the existing 35 M SAR vessels load demand to determine generator sizing, three phase motor starting arrangements, cabling, protection and DC emergency power systems, all of which are referenced against classification rules and international standards requirements where applicable. The document is constructed in a systematic way which allows the reader to identify the design processes involved in the 35 M SAR vessel. Its order may not specifically represent the order for which the electrical design is carried out; additionally it does not include specific mechanical or architectural design detail. However generalised detail is included, where applicable, in order to provide background information. It has been shown that a systematic approach to shipbuilding and a constructive and professional relationship between various <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>departments</b> is paramount to the successful construction of a maritime vessel. It was additionally identified that during the electrical engineering design process, assumptions are made based on past experiences and practical appreciation for vessel load demands during normal operational conditions, which ultimately ensures system loading is reduced while still maintaining operational requirements of the vessel. It is however identified that over-sizing of some items, such as cables, is deliberate in order to reduce installation errors and potential product availability issues...|$|R
40|$|In the Pays de Caux, runoff on crop fields is at {{the origin}} of {{important}} disturbances in frequency and costs, such as ephemeral gully erosion, muddy flows and turbidity of drinking water. As most of the slopes are gentle (< 3 %), water circulation thus strongly depends on the shape, limits and tillage direction of fields. Since 1997, in the operations of land development, techniques are proposed and realized to limit erosive runoff. Within the framework of such an operation in progress in a catchment area of 501 ha, STREAM was used to locate areas where the runoff is likely to concentrate and thus to determine suitable sites for control measures. After obtaining input data, STREAM {{made it possible to}} compare the runoff patterns and volumes before and after land consolidation and that for several spring and winter rainfall events with return periods of from 2 to 20 years. Graphic results highlight modifications of the runoff network on the plateau, due to the changes of fields’ limits and size. Since land use remained unchanged, there is no significant difference in runoff volumes at the outlet of the catchment area. On the other hand, on the plateau, STREAM highlights important local modifications related for example to the removal of a meadow (50 % more runoff). STREAM also made it possible to test the impact of the installation of two new ponds on runoff. Results show that the use of STREAM during an operation of land development can be useful, and they also make it possible to determine under which conditions it is a tool to aid <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>department</b> decision making. It makes it possible to identify the assets of existing field pattern in order to preserve them in the project and test the new field pattern at the stage of the preliminary draft in order to estimate its impact on the runoff. The <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>department</b> can then propose soil protection measures or modify the initial project...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{recovery}} {{steam generators}} (HRSG) {{play a very}} important role in combined cycle (CC) power plants, where steam is generated from a gas turbine exhaust and supplied at the appropriate pressure and temperature to steam turbines for further power generation. The power plants achieve an overall efficiency above 55 % and are ideally suited for combined heat and power generation in utility systems. The performance of energy conversion is improved by reducing exergy losses which implies reducing the temperature difference between the combustion gas and the steam cycle. Thus recent HRSG designs include up to three pressure levels with reheat in the steam cycle for maximum energy recovery and the use of high pressure, high temperature superheater and reheater in CC plants. Super critical boilers are also conceivable. Since HRSG performance has a large impact on the overall efficiency of the CC power plant, an accurate simulation of the performance of the HRSG is necessary. We present a steady state HRSG model to support <b>design</b> <b>and</b> rating simulations of vertical units. The simulation model, called FELVAL, divides the boiler in its rows. The row model can also be divided several times following the tube length, to better estimate the fumes temperature distribution across the hot gas path. Another model, called SUFVAL, carries out the design as well as the automatic generation of the FELVAL units and all the needed connections. The log mean temperature difference (LMTD) method and the effectiveness-NTU (ε -NTU) method are alternatively used to compute the overall heat transferred in each part of the HRSG. The problem of convergence of boiler models with more than one row in parallel is discussed. Good initialisation of the different variables is crucial to obtain convergence. The models are tested on 2 references HRSG. The first one is an assisted circulation boiler that operates at 3 subcritical pressure levels. The second is a once through boiler able to operate above the critical pressure of water. These new models were introduced into a commercial software of data reconciliation (VALI of Belsim sa) already used by the <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>departments</b> of a HRSG manufacturer. They thus have a general-purpose package enabling them to make <b>design,</b> data reconciliation <b>and</b> simulation with the same software. Moreover, the use of FELVAL model will enable them to simulate any type of boiler and to obtain informations on the change of the temperatures inside the heat exchangers. This information is crucial for well monitoring closely the operation of a boiler, and better understanding its behaviour. This knowledge improvement allows to limit the overdesign and the safety margins and to reduce the investment costs...|$|R
40|$|In the era {{of climate}} change, rising sea levels, {{the hole in the}} ozone layer and current food crisis, {{sustainability}} is no longer a matter of choice; it is a must. While the term sustainability manages to embed itself in all aspects of contemporary life, sustainability in the built environment requires special attention. Designs created by architects and planners play a fundamental part in shaping the way we live, behave and interact with our surroundings. Smith (2001) argued that instilling sustainable design in curricula at schools of architecture is a significant method of encouraging sustainable architectural design in practice. This is particularly important in non-sustainable societies such as those of the Middle East. For these reasons, this study aims at exploring ‘sustainability strategies,’ as they may be described, adopted in different schools of architecture. The research surveys architectural curricula at different Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) exempted schools of Architecture, at part 1 and 2 levels. Meanwhile, it also observes the contradiction and difficulties of teaching sustainable architectural <b>design</b> in Egyptian <b>and</b> Middle Eastern societies, whose cultural fabric does not encourage environmental awareness. Finally, the study attempts to investigate, in an increased level of detail, how sustainable design education fits into the undergraduate and postgraduate curricula of the Architectural <b>Engineering</b> <b>and</b> Environmental <b>Design</b> <b>Department</b> (AEED) at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT) in Alexandria, Egypt.

40|$|Today, Global {{warming is}} a major dilemma facing our globe that has changed the world {{concerns}} to reconsider the pollution sources affecting planet earth. This along with the tremendous increase in carbon dioxide emissions {{all over the world}} in the last decade has simulated the EDRG (Environmental Design Research Group, at the Architectural <b>Engineering</b> <b>and</b> Environmental <b>Design</b> <b>Department)</b> at the AAST (Arab Academy for Science and Technology) to setting the Environmental awareness campaign in the Schools of Alexandria, Egypt. The campaign is run mainly by Architecture professors, and both graduates and postgraduates of the architecture department and this is where the novelty of this campaign mainly lies and will be discussed in this paper. Environmental issues are not properly integrated in curricula of secondary schools in Egypt, and attract quite a little attention there. Continuous research carried out by the EDRG founded by the authors of this paper highlighted the problem of local environmental awareness in Egypt and {{that it was one of}} the main obstacles behind lessening pollution rates in this region and saving the environment. Therefore, this campaign has set this awareness program as today’s kids are the aim of proper development in Egypt. This project has two main objectives to fulfil; one is to engage the architectural students in raising sustainable and environmental awareness in our non-sustainable societies and second is to raise environmental awareness of school children and the youth by using artistic means, and to encourage them to participate in solution of environmental problems in their communities. Theatre, movie, painting and social role-plays are perceived as an interactive method to speak up global environmental problems in understandable and creative way. The campaign promotes and aware students within all education levels about the main reasons behind global warming, climate change and pollution and the proper use of renewable energy technologies, ecological and sustainable approaches to decrease carbon dioxide emissions all over the world and save our planet earth. The paper considers the role of environmental awareness at an early stage in the proper application of alternative energy sources in our built environment. The environmental awareness campaign is discussed along with its main aims and outcomes in this paper. The paper also contemplates the role of Architects and Architecture students in social interaction and in awareness of their communities...|$|R
40|$|Material surface {{topography}} is {{an important}} factor for regulating cellular behaviour. Understanding the mechanism of how surface topography influences mammalian cells is critical for the development of medical implants <b>and</b> tissue <b>engineering.</b> In this study, we investigated the influences of nanoporous and microgrooved substrates on the morphology and migration of hepatic cell line, BEL- 7402 cells. Cells were cultured on nanoporous (140 nm in diameter) anodized alumina membrane (AAM), nanoporous (140 nm in diameter) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and microgrooves (10 μm, 30 μm, and 50 μm in width, and 2 μm in depth) patterned PDMS, then imaged by fluorescent microscopy, time-lapse microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell morphology and migration were investigated through image analysis. The results suggest that the nanoporous and microgrooved surface structure induced totally different changes on BEL- 7402 cells. Compared to the well-spread cells on the flat surface plate, the cells formed spheroids on the nanoporous AAM surface and nanoporous PDMS surface with no elongation and alignment, while the cells grew with elongated and aligned morphology along the microgrooves on the PDMS substrates. The BEL- 7402 cell migration speed was significantly higher on the nanoporous substrates than on the flat surfaces. On the microgrooved PDMS substrates, the cells migrated along the groove direction and showed relatively small difference of the overall velocity compared to the cells on the flat PDMS surface. Our findings provide insights into the control of cell morphological features and migratory behaviour by using artificial nanoporous or microgrooved substrates, which can benefit the research on hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, tissue <b>engineering,</b> <b>and</b> medical implant <b>design.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Physic...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} of the film, Jim Lippard {{described}} it as professionally produced with excellent cinematography and high-quality graphics and effects. He had no criticism of the acting, which is mostly shown as visual effects during voice-overs of interviews or narration. As a documentary it starts reasonably, though putting unusual emphasis on Darwin [...] "making up stories" [...] as a child, and has the professional historians as the first experts shown. Lippard thought the film veered into creationist areas when discussing the influence of Charles Lyell's uniformitarianism, showing Peter Bowler stating that it was then a settled question that the earth is of great age, but not today: in emails, Carl Wieland of Creation Ministries International and Steve Murray who directed the film advised that the statement was {{about the fact that}} there was no Young Earth creationist movement at that time. The film then presented as experts several people without identifying them as creationists <b>and</b> intelligent <b>design</b> advocates. Lippard thought perhaps the most deceptive aspect of the film was that these people were shown as though they were on a par with established experts, misleadingly representing their subject areas and not mentioning that two work for CMI while an intelligent design proponent is a professor at Biola University.

40|$|Obtaining an {{efficient}} and effective product realization process demands a well-managed interface between the product development process and production process. Coordinating the process becomes however more difficult if the production site is located in one country <b>and</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> <b>department</b> in another. A dispersed setting {{like this is a}} reality for many manufacturing companies today. The product development-production (PD-P) interface is defined as the inter-dependencies between product development process to the production process and the studies indicates that the PD-P interface consist of four components; Technology, Organization, Scope, and Task. The product technology is dependent on the production process technology. The organizational component is the dependency between the product development process and production in terms of organizational structure, culture and the dependencies between the people involved. Production is dependent on prototypes, CAD-files and other information transferred from product development to secure the process which leads to the Scope component. The activities in product development are strongly dependent on the production activities and vice versa, which is the Task component. Three case studies were performed to study the PD-P interface in a dispersed setting. Identified problems in the PD-P interface were categorized in the four components mentioned above and then discussed from a product development management perspective. The cases indicate that communication becomes much more difficult in a dispersed setting. Not only can communication-hinders cause conflicts, but also inhibit the use of development tools such as DfA (Design for Assembly). There is also an uncertainty in choosing a coordination mechanism due to the dispersed setting. The need for formalized structure can increase in a PD-P interface because of a dispersed setting. However, increased formalization has a number of drawbacks, which suggest that different coordination mechanisms could be beneficial depending on which phases the project is in. A dispersed setting means cultural differences, time zones, and distances between project members. In addition to information and communication, and formalization, trust are also discussed as important to coordinate product development activities and manage the PD-P interface in a dispersed setting. Trust is seen as a foundation for good working cooperation and once established it has an effect on e. g. project commitment. However, due to the dispersed setting there is a challenge to reach high trust between project members...|$|R
