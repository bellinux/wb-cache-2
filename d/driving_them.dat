5|$|At age 16, Alexander's {{education}} under Aristotle ended. Philip waged {{war against}} Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named Alexandropolis.|$|E
5|$|Four Vanaja's {{were shown}} at the Barcelona {{international}} fair in June 1961. The vehicles {{were taken to the}} fair by <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> through Europe. The fair was considered successful, but no vehicle sales resulted from it.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Hawaii, {{fishermen}} occasionally hunted dolphins {{for their}} meat by <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> {{onto the beach}} and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat {{was considered to be}} kapu (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.|$|E

6000|$|... "Under my tail. At least, the man's {{looking for}} it there! This is beautiful. They can't use their sticks, and it's <b>driving</b> <b>'em</b> wild. Give old Blinkers a push and then he'll go over." ...|$|R
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Female vampire-like monsters are the Soucouyant of Trinidad, and the Tunda and Patasola of Colombian folklore, {{while the}} Mapuche of {{southern}} Chile have the bloodsucking snake {{known as the}} Peuchen. Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American superstition. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skeletal-faced spirits {{of those who died}} in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> mad.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, local author Neil Thompson {{published}} a book, The Elliston Incident, {{which included the}} camp oven story and said that Geharty (spelled Gehirty in the book) was involved in rounding up Aboriginal people and <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> over the cliffs south of Elliston, resulting in 20 deaths. For many years, Aboriginal people from {{the west coast of}} South Australia have retold the story of a massacre at Elliston as part of their oral history.|$|E

He gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd, and <b>driving</b> <b>'em</b> down to a water-hole to drink at noon.|$|R

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> away.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E

5000|$|On 4 August, Nelson Piquet Jr. {{was told}} by Renault he would not {{continue}} <b>driving</b> for <b>them</b> {{for the rest of}} the season. [...] "I have received notice from Renault of its intention to stop me from <b>driving</b> for <b>them</b> in the current F1 season", read a statement on Piquet's website. Piquet had described the 2009 season as [...] "the worst period of my career" [...] and had criticised team boss Flavio Briatore. He was replaced by test driver Romain Grosjean as of the European Grand Prix.|$|R

5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E
5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot and a {{close friend}} of Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis takes pride {{in the history of the}} protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> away was a sin. A scar runs down his left eye. Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E
5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E
50|$|There were {{contractual}} wrangles with Ronnie Peterson, reportedly discontent at Lotus and it {{was uncertain}} up until the start of practice whether he would be <b>driving</b> for <b>them</b> or Shadow.|$|R

5|$|On 13 April 1962, the Beatles were booked as {{the opening}} act for {{the launch of}} a new club. The Star-Club, opened by Manfred Weissleder, had a {{capacity}} for two thousand people, as well as cinema-style seating. When the Beatles were booked to play there, Neil Aspinall left his job to become the Beatles' permanent road manager, as he was earning more money <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> around than he was earning by being an accountant, and had his van ferried to Hamburg. The Beatles returned to Hamburg by plane to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962. Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death.|$|E
5|$|On 13–14 May, German forces {{crossed the}} Meuse near Sedan using {{integrated}} land and air tactics {{that broke the}} morale of the French 55th Infantry Division, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> out of the blockhouse line and allowing the Germans to gain a strong position from which to exploit the breakthrough. A progressive collapse of the French Second and Ninth Armies from 14 May to 17 May allowed German forces to move to the west of La Ferté, cutting La Ferté off from much of its mobile support.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army {{clashed with}} two regiments {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood of the British Army. Mercer and his troops were overrun, and Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent a brigade of militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help them. The militia, on seeing the flight of Mercer's men, also began to flee. Washington rode up with {{reinforcements}} and rallied the fleeing militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood's troops, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton.|$|E

5|$|Sturdee's {{operations}} were effective. On Bougainville, {{at a cost}} of 516 Australian dead and 1,572 wounded, Savige's troops had occupied much of the island and killed 8,500 Japanese; another 9,800 died from malnutrition and disease. On New Britain, where 74 Australians died and 140 were wounded, the heavily outnumbered 5th Division had overrun central New Britain. Meanwhile, the 6th Division at Aitape and Wewak had lost 442 dead and 1,141 wounded while clearing the Japanese from the coast and <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> into the mountains, killing 9,000 and taking 269 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E
5|$|The next Imperial {{attempt to}} retake the island with the newly arrived troops {{occurred}} from 20–26 October and was defeated with heavy {{losses in the}} Battle for Henderson Field. At the same time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet) defeated U.S. naval forces in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, <b>driving</b> <b>them</b> away from the area. The Japanese carriers, however, were also forced to retreat because of losses to carrier aircraft and aircrews. Thereafter, Yamamoto's ships returned to their main bases at Truk in Micronesia, where he had his headquarters, and Rabaul while three carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.|$|E

50|$|In {{the weeks}} prior to Brazil, Honda also {{announced}} their 2013 driver lineup. Gabriele Tarquini and Tiago Monteiro would join the works team for the following season, with Monteiro also <b>driving</b> for <b>them</b> in the final three events of the 2012 season.|$|R
