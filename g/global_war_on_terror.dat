5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of Defense had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E

For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the Moravian peace tradition, [...] argues that the theme of [...] "sacrifice" [...] has fueled the rise of what she calls [...] "U.S. war culture." [...] The result is a {{diversion}} of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the <b>global</b> American <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror.</b> However, some Protestant denominations such as the Churches of Christ, have largely turned away from pacifism to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.|$|R

5|$|Formed {{out of the}} Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, {{the brigade}} {{has a long history}} of {{supporting}} the 82nd in numerous contingencies throughout the world. The sustainment brigade supported the division in operations including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Power Pack and Operation Desert Storm. Recently, the brigade has seen multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade's mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan came to an end when responsibility was handed to the 101st Sustainment Brigade during a ceremony at Bagram Airbase on 2 December 2010. For the first time since the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> began in 2001, with the exception of Delta Detachment, 82nd Finance, all the elements of the 82nd Sustainment Brigade were home in Fort Bragg. Since then, the 82nd Sustainment Brigade has once again been called upon to assist in OEF Afghanistan by establishing and controlling CMRE operations. On 21 May 2015, the brigade realigned back under the 82nd Airborne Division and became the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E

The analysis assesses the complexities behind often essentialized depictions of Islam.

40|$|Bodies of Terror/Terrorizing Bodies is an {{examination}} of the biopolitical manifestations of the global military and security operations that have taken place under the conditions set forth by the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> By tracing the discursive movements that place the body at the locus of the ongoing <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> this project aims to uncover the alignment of several power operations directed at the flesh of those individuals at the center of, and on the peripheries of, this war. Through a reading of several historical sites and present day occurrences from within the discourse of the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> including images available from popular culture, the torture photographs from Abu Ghraib, and political arguments presented within the popular press, this thesis aims to answer four simple questions. Firstly, how did the body become the central site of power operations within the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror?</b> Secondly, to what extent are the biopolitics of the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> related to other discourses of the body, and even more particularly, how are dominant notions of masculine, white heterosexuality revealed within the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror?</b> Thirdly, {{what are the implications of}} the actualization of these biopolitics on the lives of individuals who may, or may not be, the targets of the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror?</b> And finally, what avenues for resistance, and what new assemblages, are opened up to bodies and individuals through the corporeal discourse of the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror...</b>|$|R
