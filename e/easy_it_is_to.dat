5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

In 2008 the building was temporary “stolen” by the New York Daily News to show how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks {{were not required to}} validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of King Kong, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber. The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with other}} Final Destination characters, Clear was {{conceived}} by series creator Jeffrey Reddick. Ali Larter, who {{starred in the}} 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as Clear Rivers. Larter stated that she was thrilled to [...] "be playing a more introverted, darker character than [...] was accustomed to at the time". She thought the script was special and turned down all other scripts where {{she would have been}} cast in roles such as a cheerleader or a victim. Larter liked the themes of both films and thought they were fascinating within their genre. According to her, the film shows how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> turn on someone and to blame someone when you're scared and about trusting your intuitions and yourself.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, {{than it would be}} to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} mystery (Ten Little Niggers) has long been abandoned as offensive in English-speaking countries {{and a number of}} others.

These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Light, [...] "could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate." [...] Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, [...] "Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.

2500|$|The Russian psychic Alla Vinogradova {{was said}} {{to be able to move}} objects without {{touching}} them on transparent acrylic plastic or a plexiglass sheet. The parapsychologist Stanley Krippner had observed Vinogradova rub an aluminum tube before moving it allegedly by psychokinesis. Krippner suggested no psychokinesis was involved; the effect was produced by an electrostatic charge. Vinogradova was featured in the Nova documentary Secrets of the Psychics (1993) which followed the debunking work of James Randi. Vinogradova demonstrated her alleged psychokinetic abilities on camera for Randi and other investigators. Before the experiments she was observed combing her hair and rubbing the surface of the acrylic plastic. Massimo Polidoro has replicated the feats of Vinogradova by using an acrylic plastic surface and showing how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> move any kind of object on top of it due to the charges of static electricity. The effect is easily achieved if the surface is electrically charged by rubbing a towel or a hand on it. The physicist John Taylor has written [...] "It is very likely that electrostatics is all that is needed to explain Alla Vinogradova's apparently paranormal feats." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has {{been referred to}} as the [...] "imageability effect". According to this idea, the ease with which a mental image can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word. In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it. This variable, ease of predication, is a rating of how <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word. For example, when presented with the word [...] "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or predicates, such as [...] "has four legs", [...] "is an animal", or [...] "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers. Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.|$|E
