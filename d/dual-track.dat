25|$|With the {{development}} and urbanisation of the New Territories, the British Section became an important corridor to connect the new towns in eastern New Territories with urban Kowloon. Electrification and conversion to a <b>dual-track</b> system was completed in 1984. Since then, the suburban rail became much more metro-like. Frequent service was provided, and in the 1990s trains were refurbished to provide fewer seats and more standing places.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a <b>dual–tracking</b> Radio Frequency (RF) front–end for a multi–constellation Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver. The RF frond–end {{is based on the}} direct RF conversion architecture, which employs sub–Nyquist sampling (also known as subsampling) at RF. The <b>dual–tracking</b> RF front–end is composed of a few RF components that are duplicated to form the two RF channels. Employing a dual–channel Analogue–to–Digital Converter (ADC) enables synchronisation of the RF channels and minimises the errors resulting from the differences in the satellite clocks and the propagation delay between the two RF channels. The digitised GNSS signals are processed by two separate acquisition and tracking engines that are driven by the front–end’s master clock. This setup provides two synchronised receivers that are integrated onto one piece of hardware. The hardware is intended to be used for research applications such as multipath mitigation, scintillation assessment, and advanced satellite clock and spatial frame transformation modelling...|$|R

25|$|However, work did {{not start}} in 2003. In November 2005, {{there was still no}} {{progress}} to be seen, and the extensive planning was not fully completed. In a press release on November 30, 2005, Transportation Minister Meir Sheetrit announced that he was considering connecting Nazareth and Migdal HaEmek to the planned valley railway, and that the railway would be completed in 2008–09 (starting construction in 2006). The original plans to build a full <b>dual-track</b> railway in the initial phase were scrapped in favor of single-track for most of the route (between Nesher and Beit She'an). On February 22, 2006, Israel Railways and the Nature and Parks Authority transferred 1,500 endangered geophytes from the route of the railway.|$|E
25|$|Further {{developments}} in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include {{research by the}} Overseas Development Institute {{into the role of}} equity. Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a virtuous circle where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as political. Examples abound, including Brazil's cash transfers, Uganda's eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else Mauritius's <b>dual-track</b> approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the World Trade Organization. Researchers at the ODI thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though in}} the late 1950s Israel Railways began using diesel locomotives, and {{repaired}} the line, it did not convert it to a <b>dual-track</b> configuration and travel time was still high. The Jaffa Railway Station was abandoned, and the final destination on the coast was changed to Tel Aviv's Beit Hadar Station (the original Tel Aviv South station), which in turn was changed to the newer Tel Aviv South station, marking the complete dismantlement of the line inside Tel Aviv's urban area. The reasons cited were {{the fact that the}} line was causing traffic jams in the city, and the high land value of the area for real estate development. Then-transportation minister Shimon Peres was a prime supporter of the cancellation of the line inside the city and worked to create a new station (Tel Aviv South) in an unused plot of land given to Israel Railways by the government in compensation for the areas inside Tel Aviv it gave up.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial {{areas in the}} Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils. To achieve this, <b>dual-tracking</b> between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% {{increase in}} capacity when Route 4 was extended to Wimbledon. To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as <b>dual-tracking</b> of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in South Wimbledon or Colliers Wood and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon. This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed South London Metro at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon. The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur. New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), {{as well as an}} additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services. This plan may be in service by 2023.|$|R

25|$|In 1934, the German Army High Command (OKH) {{commissioned}} Krupp of Essen {{to design}} a gun to destroy the forts of the French Maginot Line that were nearing completion. The gun's shells had to punch through seven metres of reinforced concrete or one full metre of steel armour plate, from beyond the range of French artillery. Krupp engineer Erich Müller calculated that the task would require a weapon with a calibre of around 80cm, firing a projectile weighing 7 tonnes from a barrel 30 metres long. The weapon would have a weight of over 1000 tonnes. The size and weight meant that to be at all movable it {{would need to be}} supported on twin sets of railway tracks. In common with smaller railway guns, the only barrel movement on the mount itself would be elevation, traverse being managed by moving the weapon along a curved section of {{what turned out to be}} a <b>dual-track</b> railway line.

25|$|To support {{developments}} in Croydon, {{construction of a}} diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the Ruskin Square development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, {{and return to the}} Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out. The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, <b>dual-tracking</b> of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required. This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of Westfield and Hammerson, with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020.|$|R

Data under simulated conditions are collected in two databases, the SUSAS and DLP databases, which include simulated stress by asking subjects to respond to an externally controlled condition, such as speaking rate (DLP), or speaking style (SUSAS), or <b>dual-tracking</b> computer workload (SUSAS). Parameters indicating a change in speech characteristics {{as a function of the}} stress condition (e.g., pitch, intensity, duration, and spectral envelope) are applied to several samples of stressed speech. The effect on speech obtained for perceptual noise and some physical stressors is evaluated. It is shown that the effect of stressed speech on the performance of automatic speech recognizers and automatic speaker recognizers is marginal for some types of stress (DLP), while the speaking style has a major effect. In the speaker recognition task, their evaluation shows that when stress is present, the recognition rates decrease significantly especially for speech under loud and angry condition.|$|R
