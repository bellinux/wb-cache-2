5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin.

40|$|Lesional skin of {{patients}} with atopic dermatitis (AD) is histologically characterized by hypertrophy of <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and <b>the</b> in®ltration {{of a large number}} of eosinophils and T cells into the dermis. Recent studies have indicated that Th 2 cells play a crucial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis of AD skin. Chemokines and their receptors are implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of symptoms of various skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis vulgaris (psoriasis). We have examined <b>the</b> <b>in</b> situ expression of a typical T h 2 -type chemokine, thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and its receptor (CCR 4) using immunohistochemical techniques. TARC was found to be highly expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basal epidermis of <b>the</b> lesional <b>skin</b> of AD patients and only slightly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-lesional <b>skin.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, no positive cells were seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lesional <b>skin</b> of psoriasis.

5|$|Osteoderms (bony plates formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin)</b> {{have been}} found with at least 10 {{titanosaur}} genera. The lack of osteoderms in the nearly complete Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton might indicate that they are absent in this genus.

5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, {{to lubricate}} and waterproof {{the skin and}} hair of mammals.

5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates {{with a high}} keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three rows of these along {{each side of the}} torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two rows of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four rows of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the torso and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> sugar, acids and pH levels other {{components of the}} grapes are building up during the ripening process. The mineral components of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium increase in concentration as they are disseminated among <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> grapes and its fleshy pulp. The color of the grape berries begin to change due to the building up of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins.</b> Flavonoids and volatile compounds known as [...] "flavor precursors" [...] which contribute to the eventual flavor and aroma of the wine also begin to build up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and pulp. Additionally the concentration of tannins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grape increases <b>in</b> several areas of the grape including <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> seeds and stem.

5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
40|$|Grape {{polyphenols}} {{are characterized}} by a large range of structures diversely distributed {{in every part of}} the berry. The knowledge of the phenolic composition of grapes and its evolution during ripening is thus of crucial importance in relation to food quality. Among the phenolic compounds, the anthocyanins are responsible for the red color of the grapes, which are located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins,</b> while flavanols and catechins intervene in their taste (astringency) and bitterness. <b>In</b> this study, <b>the</b> contents of total phenolics, total flavan- 3 -ols and total anthocyanins were determined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pulp, <b>skins</b> and seeds of two red, Vranec and Merlot, and two white grape varieties, Smederevka and Chardonnay applying standardized spectrophotometric methods. Extraction of phenolic compounds was performed with acetone/water (80 / 20, v/v). The obtained results showed that the concentration of total phenols and flavan- 3 -ols was highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and seeds of Vranec grapes, while the pulp contained low amounts of these compounds. Chardonnay seeds contained higher amounts of phenolics and flavan- 3 -ols compared to Smederevka grapes. HPLC-MS analysis was performed in order to identify the phenolic components present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grape, applying mobile phase consisting of 1 % (v/v) acetic acid in water (solvent A) and 1 % (v/v) acetic acid in methanol (solvent B).
