5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber. Guy Fawkes <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped capture by the king's {{soldiers}} by way of an underground tunnel from Ordsall Hall to an inn at the cathedral end of Hanging Bridge, at {{the northern end of}} present-day Deansgate. There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is remembered {{in the name of the}} modern road that runs to the east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} which <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spun-up PSR B1937+21 is {{no longer}} present, {{making it one of}} few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II {{somewhere in the}} castle grounds. Richard <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure {{is said to have}} remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried out, most of them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well-founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places.|$|E

5|$|With the Mongol {{invasion}} of Rus' by Batu Khan in 1237-40, the monastery <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been completely destroyed. These legends were written down much later. The monastery {{is known to}} have existed in the 14th century, though. In 1482, it was attacked by the Crimean Tatars under Meñli I Giray. Reconstruction on the monastery began only 40 years later. In 1523, the monastery was transferred to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I. In addition, the monastery was given a full reign over its territory. In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1860s, the future writer was also {{pursuing}} an interest in politics, which eventually led him to rally with the more nationalist group within the Romanian liberal current, known as Free and Independent Faction. An agitator for his party, Creangă became commonly known under the nickname Popa Smântână ("Priest Sour Cream"). In April 1866, shortly after Domnitor Cuza was toppled by a coup, and just before Carol I was selected to replace him, the Romanian Army intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași, instigated by Moldavian Metropolitan Calinic Miclescu. It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of other Factionalists, according to which secession was preferable to Carol's rule, and was probably among the rioters. At around the same time, he began circulating antisemitic tracts, and is said to have demanded that Christians boycott Jewish business. He is thought to have coined the expression Nici un ac de la jidani ("Not even a needle from the kikes"). He was eventually selected as one of the Factionalist candidates for an Iași seat in the Romanian Deputies' Chamber, as documented by the memoirs of his conservative rival, Iacob Negruzzi. The episode <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken place at the earliest during the 1871 suffrage.|$|E
5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E

5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

Its title was Der xxxxvi. Psalm. Deus noster refugium et virtus. Before that it <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> appeared in the Hans Weiss Wittenberg hymnal of 1528, also lost. This evidence would support its being written in 1527–1529, since Luther's hymns were printed shortly after they were written.|$|E
