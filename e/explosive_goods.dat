The technique described in this study is readily scalable: replacing a single laser with a small laser array, with individual lasers operating at different frequencies will enable unambiguous identification of select materials.

40|$|Mass Spectrometry (MS) is an {{important}} analytical tool in the identification and quantification {{of a wide range}} of samples, primarily because of its speed, sensitivity, selectivity and versatility in analysing, gases, solids and liquids. MS is an interdisciplinary analytical tool, impacting many areas of science from physics, through chemistry, to biology. However MS is mainly limited to laboratory settings due to the high vacuum requirement needed for ion generation and processing. The main theme of this work is the development of ionisation methods that enable ion generation and processing under ambient conditions in the open air outside of the laboratory for in-situ applications. To that end, it is also important that ions are generated and processed with little or no extensive sample preparation steps required. In this work the development of two ambient ionisation methods: desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (DAPCI) and paper spray (PS) ionisation and their application for in-situ MS analysis is demonstrated. A DAPCI handheld ion source version based on DAPCI was developed to ignite a corona discharge in air and operates for up to 12 h continuously using only 12 V battery. Both DAPCI and PS ambient ionisation methods were implemented for in-situ MS analysis and were used to detect trace amounts (< ng) of different classes of chemical compounds (i. e hydrocarbons, explosives corrosion inhibitors and metaldehyde in waters samples); this was achieved rapidly (i. e. less than 1 minute) with little or no sample preparation in the open air. Both ambient ionisation methods (i. e., DAPCI and PS) were used with either a commercial instrument or with a custom miniature mass spectrometer to identify and characterize traces amounts of petroleum oil hydrocarbons and additives (e. g. quaternary ammonium corrosion inhibitors), and water pollutants (e. g. metaldehyde) with high sensitivity and selectivity. The handheld DAPCI and PS methods were also applied to the in-situ direct analysis of <b>explosives.</b> <b>Good</b> performance was achieved with the miniaturised instrument giving detection limits within an order of magnitude to those achieved using a benchtop commercial instrument. The results reported in this thesis should be of importance to those interested in ambient ionisation mass spectrometry, miniature mass spectrometry, in-situ MS analysis, oilfield chemical analysis, homeland and border security agencies and environmental monitoring...|$|R

A major question that arises in drilling microholes is if downhole logging and monitoring in general [...] and downhole seismic surveying in particular [...] can be conducted in such small holes since the inner working diameter of such a seismic tool could be as small as 0. 31 in. A downhole three-component accelerometer package that fits within a 031 -in. inner diameter tube has been designed, built, and tested. The package consists of three orthogonally mounted Entran EGA- 125 - 5 g piezoresistive silicon micromachined accelerometers with temperature compensation circuitry, downhole amplification, and line drivers mounted in a thin-walled aluminum tube. Accelerometers are commercially available in much smaller package sizes than conventional geophones, but the noise floor is significantly higher than that for the geophones. Cross-well tests using small <b>explosives</b> showed <b>good</b> signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded waveform at various receiver depths with a 1, 50 -ft source-receiver well separation. For some active downhole surveys, the accelerometer unit would clearly be adequate. It can be reasonably assumed, however, that for less energetic sources and for greater well separations, the high accelerometer noise floor is not acceptable. By expanding the inner working diameter of a microhole seismic tool to 0. 5 in., other commercial accelerometers {{can be used with}} substantially lower noise floors...|$|R

Since it was discovered during a war the latter characteristic was put to use, but it is now evident that use of plutonium in a particular kind of nuclear reactor, the fast breeder reactor, will allow the world's resources or uranium to last for millennia as a major source of energy. Plutonium is very radiotoxic, resembling radium in this respect. Therefore the widespread introduction of fast breeder reactors to meet energy demands can be contemplated only after assurances on two points; that adequate control of the radiological hazard resulting from the handling of very large amounts of plutonium can be guaranteed, and that diversion of plutonium to illicit use can be prevented. The problems exist to a lesser degree already, since all types of nuclear reactor produce some plutonium.

It described the events leading up the attack;In January 2003, Rais, Noordin and Azhari moved to Bengkulu, {{where a group of}} JI members lived, including Asmar Latin Sani, who became the Marriott suicide bomber. Noordin and Azhari planned the bombing there as a way of putting the <b>explosives</b> to <b>good</b> use. JI members in Bengkulu, Lampung, and Riau were involved in some planning and logistical support but were not told the target. Interestingly, Noordin began to plan for a spectacular attack with some of the Bengkulu members just as others from their wakalah were taking part in a program to refresh their military skills, {{as a response to the}} exposure and arrests that followed the Bali bombings. For most of the top JI leadership, this was a time for training and consolidation - not new attacks. But Hambali had set the precedent of going off on his own, and Noordin followed it. [...] The next stages of the operation involved small teams with ties to one another beyond the JI affiliation. Getting the explosives from Dumai to Bengkulu via Pekanbaru, Riau, in February 2003 and securing additional materials such as detonators involved Noordin, Azhari, Rais, Toni Togar, and a new team member, Masrizal bin Ali Umar. alias Tohir, another Ngruki alumnus and Luqmanul Hakiem teacher. He was a close friend of Rais and would have been trusted completely by the others. After the explosives reached Bengkulu safely as unaccompanied baggage on an ordinary intercity bus, they were stored at the house of Sardona Siliwangi, another Ngruki student and JI member. At the time the Marriott plot was being hatched, Sardona, who lived in Bengkulu, was working with Asmar Latin Sani to set up a new Ngruki-like pesantren there, and it was he who opened a bank account in March 2003 to facilitate financial transactions for Noordin.|$|R

Also, the characteristics of the different reservoirs were summarized. In regards to the oil reservoirs, large pores (PS> 10) were found to account {{for the majority of the}} reservoir spaces, and the pore distribution was concentrated and well connected. However, for the poor oil reservoirs, the large and small pores were found to alternate, and the pore distribution was scattered and poorly connected.

This molecule class is thoroughly investigated by all terms of chemical and explosive material matter and especially the 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazol- 5 -one derivatives are compared to the corresponding tetrazole derivatives which were by far the most investigated molecule moiety of Prof. Dr. T.

40|$|Context. Low-metallicity environments such as {{the early}} Universe and compact star-forming dwarf galaxies contain many massive stars. These stars {{influence}} their surroundings through intense UV radiation, strong winds and <b>explosive</b> deaths. A <b>good</b> understanding of low-metallicity environments requires a detailed theoretical comprehension {{of the evolution of}} their massive stars. Aims. We aim to investigate the role of metallicity and rotation in shaping the evolutionary paths of massive stars and to provide theoretical predictions that can be tested by observations of metal-poor environments. Methods. Massive rotating single stars with an initial metal composition appropriate for the dwarf galaxy I Zw[*] 18 ([Fe/H] = − 1. 7) are modelled during hydrogen burning for initial masses of 9 − 300 M⊙ and rotational velocities of 0 − 900 km s- 1. Internal mixing processes in these models were calibrated based on an observed sample of OB-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Results. Even moderately fast rotators, which may be abundant at this metallicity, are found to undergo efficient mixing induced by rotation resulting in quasi chemically-homogeneous evolution. These homogeneously-evolving models reach effective temperatures of up to 90 kK during core hydrogen burning. This, together with their moderate mass-loss rates, make them transparent wind ultraviolet intense stars (TWUIN star), and their expected numbers might explain the observed He[*]II ionising photon flux in I Zw[*] 18 and other low-metallicity He[*]II galaxies. Our slowly rotating stars above ~ 80 M⊙ evolve into late B- to M-type supergiants during core hydrogen burning, with visual magnitudes up to 19 m at the distance of I Zw[*] 18. Both types of stars, TWUIN stars and luminous late-type supergiants, are only predicted at low metallicity. Conclusions. Massive star evolution at low metallicity is shown to differ qualitatively from that in metal-rich environments. Our grid can be used to interpret observations of local star-forming dwarf galaxies and high-redshift galaxies, as well as the metal-poor components of our Milky Way and its globular clusters...|$|R
