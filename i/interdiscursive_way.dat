This project poses many challenges both to Information Science and to philosophy. Only when Information Science is understood as an interscience that operates in a multifaceted and interconceptual, and even <b>interdiscursive</b> <b>way,</b> as it is suggested here, it will be able to comply with the challenges.

For this reason an acritical philosophical approach is proposed that will be characterised by multiple, complex and inventive styles of thinking, organised by a compositional rather than an oppositional inspiration.
