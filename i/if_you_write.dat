2500|$|An October 18, 2006, {{article in}} the Washington Post quotes a recent {{interview}} with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, [...] "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".|$|E
2500|$|At {{one of the}} rehearsals for Toussaint, {{a fellow}} actor {{mentioned}} {{that he had just}} played a part in a Henry Jaglom film. At the time Frederick had not heard of Jaglom, but following the colleague's suggestion that [...] "supposedly, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> him a letter and tell him that you love his films, he'll cast you in a movie," [...] Frederick wrote to Jaglom. In a three-page letter she extolled the virtues of Jaglom's film Déjà Vueven though she had not actually seen it at the time. To her surprise, Jaglom called her back and invited her to a screening, and soon thereafter gave her a job at his office.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, Live Through This was {{markedly}} less frenetic than Pretty on the Inside, {{and reflected}} Love's tumultuous life between 1991 and 1994, though Love stated {{that she felt}} the record was [...] "not as personal" [...] as the band's former work: [...] "You know, when women say, [...] "Well, I play music, and it's cathartic," [...] that applies to me to a degree, but I just {{wanted to write a}} good rock record. I would love to write a couple of great rock songs in my life, like Chrissie Hynde did. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> something [...] that will transcend {{a long period of time}} and make people feel a certain way, there's really nothing like that." [...] The lyrics present on the album deal heavily with themes of motherhood, depression, body image, child abuse, and elitism, and includes recurring motifs of milk, pregnancy, and suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{teaching}} and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. [...] "Don’t you think {{talking about it}} is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" [...] says Khouri. “I feel like I owe aspiring writers at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is {{to do in the}} business,” she says. “It doesn’t matter any more how good you are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s not like you can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that’s all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the lead}} role of Julien Davenne, Truffaut first wanted to cast actor Charles Denner, {{but he was not}} available. Because of the {{personal}} nature of the film and the character of Julien Davenne, Truffaut decided to play the part, stating that [...] "this film is like a handwritten letter. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> by hand, it isn’t perfect, the writing may be shaky, but it is you, your writing." [...] This decision was not simply taken because Truffaut embodied the character, but because Davenne’s obsession, what he does throughout the whole film, what defines him, that is, keeping the memory of the dead alive, refusing to forget them, linked in a way to the activity of the director. Specifically, he felt a closeness to the character of Davenne, due to his own valuations of remembrance of the dead as helping in the [...] "struggle against the transience of life". Despite his strong feeling for the character, Truffaut was hesitant about the role and thought he may be perceived as too old. He had a wig made, but ended up not using it.. It was Truffaut's third and last of his own film in which he played a leading role. According to co-star Nathalie Baye, Truffaut almost shut the film down for fear of a bad performance: [...] "He would say to me, 'It's madness; it will never work!' And he came close to wanting to stop everything." ...|$|E
