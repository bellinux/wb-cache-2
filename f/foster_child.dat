Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a <b>foster</b> <b>child,</b> Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who knew them best.|$|E

Mr. Jarvis (John Stone), {{a man from the}} {{department}} of child services, explains that Frank's father Les (Mario Kery), is a criminal and his mother, Helena (Lee Sanderson) is an alcoholic. As he grows up he aspires to emulate Les' criminal dealings.

Frank is attracted to Roo and tells Alf that he had been helping Roo with her school work. Alf gives him the job alongside helping Roo with her studies. Frank is not good with school work so he pays his foster brother, Steven to do it for him. They begin dating, but Alf becomes angry with Frank for convincing Roo to skip school. The pair nearly sleep together, but Roo asks him to wait.|$|E

Most <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> ― age out‖ of foster care lacking {{survival}} skills. At age 21 <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> are no longer eligible for foster-care. Roughly 46 % of the foster-care population become dropouts. Through the theoretical lens, this study investigated children‘s foster - care experience regarding meeting the high school graduation requirement. Using qualitative methods, interviews were conducted on <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> who successfully {{graduated from high school}} and attend college. They provided insight into the obstacles <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> had to overcome. However, in spite of their success, they remain affected by their experience and continue to need services. Findings revealed three indicators that adversely impact a <b>foster</b> <b>child‘s</b> ability to graduate from high school— self-efficacy, emotional stability, and services. Laws must be enacted allowing <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> to remain in care while meeting their postsecondary goals. Also, the federal government must mandate an expansion of the 90 -day transition plan criterion, increase the aging out criterion to age 26 to enable <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> to reach their postsecondary goals, mandate that foster-care agencies employ an education specialist to assist students in ascertaining their career objectives and thereafter conduct a follow-up study...|$|R

Thus {{the aim of the}} present study was to determine the socio-economic, health and nutritional status of young <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> in urban Dhaka. A total of 208 (1 %; n = 208 / 28, 948) under- 5 <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> were enrolled in the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System of icddr,b between 1993 - 2012.

Lack of formal schooling of mother was higher among <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> compared to non-foster children (52 % vs. 35 %; p < 0. 001). Higher proportion of <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> suffered from some or severe dehy-dration (60 % vs. 47 %; p = 0. 001) and often received intravenous saline (12 % vs. 5 %; p = 0. 002) in comparison to non-foster children.

40|$|M. A. South Africa {{is facing}} {{a high rate of}} {{children}} in need of care due to high escalation of the HIV/AIDS related illness. The children are being left without biological parents, and they are eventually placed in the foster care custody of their extended families. Sometimes there are challenges that are experienced by the foster parents and the adolescents’ <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> as a result the adolescents’ <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> end up leaving school. Foster care learners who stay away from school or who have been entered on the register then absent themselves for substantial parts of the day, are more likely to grow up unhappy and unfulfilled, leaving school much less qualified than they might otherwise be and worst of all sometimes get drawn into a life of crime(Collins, 1998). The overall aim {{of this study is to}} explore the factors that contribute to adolescent <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> not completing their high school education and developing strategies to retain adolescents’ <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> in school. Placing the adolescents’ <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> into institutions like industrial schools and children’s homes hoping that the children’s behavior will change should be considered as the last resort that the professionals should do. The objectives of the study are: § To survey literature on foster care education, § To analyse the scope of the concept” foster care” in terms of current practice, § To investigate problems that are encountered by the foster parents and how do they deal with the teenagers’ problems, § To investigate the problems encountered by the teenagers or adolescents <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> and also identify their unmet needs, § To investigate the problems encountered by the <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> while still at school, § To identify challenges of educators towards foster care learners. iii Qualitative research methodology was applied with the researcher selecting participatory action research to engage adolescents’ <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> <b>foster</b> parents and educators in the study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{relations}} between foster parents and their <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> what kind of motivation there is behind their involvement in <b>foster</b> <b>children,</b> how they experience the commission and what good parenting mean to them. The study is including eight foster parents. They have experience of both long and short placement of <b>foster</b> <b>children.</b> The results show that all these foster families have at least one child that they have a good relationship with. It is important to know that those children either have spent many years in foster families or arrived to foster families when they were very young or as infants. Results show that there are many motives for commissions. But the leading motive is empathy to children and a desire to take care of those children who are deprived and need love. The commission has both positive and negative aspects. The most positive aspects of the commission are to see those <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> successfully developed and turned in to good human beings. On the other hand the most negative aspects of the commission are, that the own children don’t get so much own time and space with the parents, because <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> takes most of their free time. Good foster parents are those who ensure to <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> a feeling of secure, acceptance, empathy and who have capacity to see <b>foster</b> <b>children</b> as individuals.
