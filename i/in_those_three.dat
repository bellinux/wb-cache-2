5|$|Krovanh first {{struck the}} Philippines, {{resulting}} in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000families. The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. Krovanh's effects {{were much more}} severe in China. In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred {{as a result of}} the typhoon's outer rainbands. However, Guangdong Province, Hainan Province, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>three</b> regions combined, 13,000homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged. Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at ¥2.1 billion (US$253 million). Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000homes were flattened. One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons.|$|E

In the second match, Andrew Pattison's 6–0 set win in men's singles proved {{too much for the}} Freedoms to {{overcome}} despite winning three of the five sets in the match. Buster Mottram started that set for the Freedoms against Pattison.

With fourteen yellow cards in the final (one red card to John Heitinga – twice yellow), he easily broke the previous record of six for most cards in a World Cup final, set in 1986. Nine of these Final yellow cards came in the first 90 minutes. Webb's total of 31 yellow cards throughout the tournament came to an average of 7.75 per game.|$|E

He made a 68 break in the decider, and sealed a 10–9 victory with a sensational double on the brown. In securing his third UK title, Higgins became only the fourth player after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan, to win the second biggest ranking tournament in snooker three or more times. As {{a result of his}} progress <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>three</b> events, where he won 18 out of 19 matches, Higgins earned sufficient points to regain his position as World No. 1 under the new two-year rolling ranking system after having slipped to third by missing the start of the 2010/2011 season.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 Buccaneers {{defense is}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 1976 Steelers, and few others.

They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43).
