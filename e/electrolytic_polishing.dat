40|$|Smooth {{surfaces}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in many industries, such as medical, chemical or food. In some industrial areas, the mechanical treatment of surfaces (grinding and polishing) does not fulfil desired specifications. Non-abrasive methods (chemical and electrochemical) have the advantage that even complex geometries and free-form shapes can be polished. In {{the context of this}} paper, electrochemical surface treatment is considered in more detail. Both electro polishing, which is state of the art, and the novel <b>electrolytic</b> plasma <b>polishing</b> (EPP) process are presented. This paper focusses on the <b>electrolytic</b> plasma <b>polishing</b> because it has many advantages compared to the process of electro polishing. The theoretical operation of the <b>electrolytic</b> plasma <b>polishing</b> is shown. A prototype system for plasma polishing of internal surfaces of pipes was installed and a polishing head was developed. Several parameters are investigated, such as the width of the adjustable polishing head gap and different velocities v or different applied potential differences U, and first results of the average surface roughness Sa as function of the various parameters were evaluated. It can be seen that a stable polishing process can be achieved at the highest potential difference of 320 V and that the average surface roughness Sa reaches a range from 0. 065 to 0. 090 µm. At the same time, {{it has been shown that}} with increasing potential difference, the average surface roughness becomes independent of the width of the adjustable polishing head gap...|$|R
40|$|Micro-structures of RF {{surfaces}} in the electron-beam-weld (EBW) regions of niobium samples were studied. These surfaces were polished with different techniques, namely buffered chemical polish (1 : 1 : 2 BCP) and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polish</b> (EP). It {{was found that}} there are three distinctively different regions near the EBW, characterized by different grain sizes, shapes, and orientations. Strikingly, we found grain boundaries within the EBW are nicely lined up so that they form an angle of about 60 degree with respect to the weld seam. Upon being polished with BCP, these grain boundaries evolve into micro-steps with sharp edges, due to preferential etching of different crystallographic planes. There is evidence that the step height increases up to possibly more than 30 microns with repeated chemical polish. In contrast to the result with BCP, dimensions of surface irregularities were reduced with EP and sharp edges were rounded off. These observations have important implications in explanations of the high-field-Q-drop of niobium superconducting cavities...|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of metallography was a continuous {{struggle to find}} better and easier methods to prepare metal surfaces for microstructure observation. Struers based his new principle for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> on Count Alois von Beckh Widmanstätten and his early experiments {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century that revealed the structure of iron from a meteor which had come down earlier in the century. He noticed that the structure could better be seen on plane, fine polished surfaces. By pouring nitric acid over the surface and letting it react for some time, he actually made a deep etch which developed the macrostructure. Pieces etched this way were used for printing the structure directly on paper. These [...] "nature prints" [...] turned [...] "metallography" [...] into lithography. All these experiments did not lead to any evaluation of the microstructure, but were limited to the macrostructure.|$|E

The influence of chemical composition of the bath used in <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> and anodic passivation process on the morphology, wettability and corrosion resistance of the electrochemically modified vanadium-free Ti- 15 Mo alloy was presented. The electropolishing process was carried out in a solution containing: sulphuric acid, ethylene glycol, ammonium fluoride and oxalic acid.

40|$|Plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>Polishing</b> (PeP) is a non-conventional {{technology}} for the surface treatment of electrically conductive materials. It is an effective machining technique for cleaning and polishing of metals and considered as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the electropolishing process. The electropolishing process uses aggressive media such as acids, whereas in PeP, acids or toxicants are replaced by low concentrated water solutions of various salts. In PeP, high DC voltage {{is applied to the}} electrodes in the aqueous electrolyte solution, which establishes a thin steam-gas layer around the surface of the work piece resulting in the generation of plasma. From the previous research, it is found that the formation of stable plasma generally takes place between 180 - 370 volts, where it results in better surface conditions.

40|$|Efficient {{lightweight}} structures require {{intelligent materials}} that meet versatile functions. Especially, carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are gaining relevance. Their increasing use aims at reducing energy consumption in many applications. CFRPs are generally very light in weight, {{while at the}} same time being extremely stiff and strong (specific strength: CFRPs: 1. 3 Nm kg – 1, steel: 0. 27 Nm kg – 1; specific stiffness: CFRPs: 100 Nm kg – 1, steel: 25 Nm kg – 1). To increase performance and especially functionality of CFRPs, the integration of microelectronic components into CFRP parts is aspired. The functionalization by sensors, actuators and electronics can enable a high lightweight factor and a new level of failure-safety. The integration of microelectronic components for this purpose requires a working procedure to provide electrical contacts for a reliable connection to energy supply and data interfaces. To overcome this challenge, metalized carbon fibers are used. Metalized fibers are, similar to the usual reinforcing fibers, able to be soldered and therefore easy to incorporate into CFRPs. Unfortunately, metalized fibers have to be pre-treated by flux-agents. Until now, there is no flux which is suitable for mass production without destroying the polymer of the CFRP. The process of plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> (PeP) could be an option, but is so far not available for copper. Thus, in this study, plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> is transferred to copper and its alloys. To achieve this, electrolytic parameters as well as the electrical setup are adapted. It can be observed that the gloss and roughness can be adjusted by means of this procedure. Finally, plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> is used to treat thin copper layers on carbon fibers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{investigations}} a dependence between {{the parameters of the}} electrochemical treatment of austenitic steel and their electrochemical behavior in Tyrod solution. Design/methodology/approach: Specimens (rode 30 mm × ø 1 mm) were to give in to the surface treatment – mechanically polishing, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> and passivation with various parameter. Electrochemical investigations concerning the corrosion resistance of austenitic steel samples were carried out by means of the potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. Findings: The analysis of the obtained results leads to the conclusion that chemical passivation affects also the chemical composition of the passive layer of steel and changes its resistance to corrosion. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> improves corrosion resistance, as can be proved by the shift {{of the value of the}} corrosion potential and break-down potential of the passive layer and the initiation of pittings. Research limitations/implications: The obtained results are the basis for the optimization of anodic passivation parameters of the austenitic steel as a metallic biomaterial. The future research should be focused on selected more suitable parameters of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test to better describe process on the solid/ liquid interface. Practical implications: In result of the presented investigations it has been found that the best corrosion resistance can be achieved thanks to the application of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polishing</b> of the steel in a special bath and chemical passivation in nitric (V) acid with an addition of chromic (VI) acid temperature t = 60 °C for one hour. Originality/value: The enormous demand for metal implants has given rise to a search for cheap materials with a good biotolerance and resistance to corrosion.
