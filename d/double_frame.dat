5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later <b>double</b> <b>frame,</b> 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Morse yard's blacksmith shop in the December 1917 fire, a new steel-and-glass shop was constructed {{at the foot of the}} company's South Pier. The new shop included 56 furnaces and a number of steam hammers. A new heavy forge shop was also built. This shop had nine oil-fired heating furnaces, including a [...] car bottom type annealing furnace, all with doors operated by compressed air. The shop also contained a 50-ton steam hydraulic press capable of delivering a 1,000-ton pressure, a 4,000lb <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> steam hammer with a 2-ton capacity, a 20-ton overhead crane and 10-ton auxiliary hoist along with two 25-ton rotators, and even its own railway siding and derrick. Other facilities of the Morse yard around this time included a three-story machine shop, carpentry shop, pattern and joining shop, storage depots etc.|$|E

5000|$|Intended as the {{flagship}} {{of the new}} Carpenter product lineup, the 2001 Chancellor RE rear-engine Type D (transit-style) school bus was built on a Spartan Motors chassis. Its chassis featured full air-ride suspension and <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> rails for a ride similar to a motorcoach; a flat floor inside the bus was created from the <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> {{as well as from}} the fitment of smaller-diameter wheels (19" [...] vs. the standard 22.5"). Unlike its Crown RE predecessor, the Chancellor RE did not feature an option for a rear emergency door, opting instead for a window emergency exit traditionally seen on rear-engine school buses.|$|E

50|$|During the Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, and Championship Final, {{the eight}} {{qualifying}} team were paired {{off in a}} head-to-head knockout. The format for these matches was a best-of-seven frame competition with the contest {{coming to an end}} as soon as one team had won four frames. These encounters were scheduled as two singles, a <b>doubles</b> <b>frame,</b> two reverse singles, another <b>doubles</b> <b>frame,</b> and a winner-take-all singles if necessary.|$|R
50|$|Each match {{consisted}} of five frames and all frames were played. Each player played one frame against each {{player in the}} other team plus one <b>doubles</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nantucket {{measured}} 190 {{feet long}} with {{a beam of}} 33 feet. It was copper fastened, and its <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> made of oak, hackmatack and cedar. It goes [...] "toot toot". Its hull had three watertight bulkheads, and drew four-and-a-half feet of water.|$|E
50|$|However, as full HD {{televisions}} {{were launched}} in 2005 and full HD with <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> rate in 2007, higher-speed demands in high-definition televisions have required advanced technologies in driver interfaces.

50|$|The Midland Railway 480 Class was a {{class of}} <b>double</b> <b>framed</b> 0-6-0 steam locomotive, {{designed}} by Matthew Kirtley for the Midland Railway of Britain. They were built between 1863 and 1868.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway 700 Class {{was a large}} {{class of}} <b>double</b> <b>framed</b> 0-6-0 freight steam {{locomotives}} designed by Matthew Kirtley for the Midland Railway. They were in the power classification 1F.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR 273 {{class was}} {{a class of}} <b>double</b> <b>framed</b> 0-6-0 steam {{locomotives}} designed by William George Beattie for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Twelve locomotives were built between 1872 and 1873.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{issue is}} {{characterized}} by a larger portrait of Dr. Sun in a <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> with a square-toothed line between the frames, lens forms in the side panels, and Arabic numeral tablets on banners in the lower corners. It was first produced on native paper by the Chung Hwa Book Co. of Chongqing in 1944, and includes nine values. A number of overprints exist.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1840s Alexander Allan and William Buddicom of the Grand Junction Railway created the design {{incorporating}} inclined outside cylinders and a <b>double</b> <b>frame.</b> It was built due {{to combat the}} frequent failure of crank axles on contemporary inside cylinder locomotive designs. The earliest examples were built by Buddicom at Chartreux for the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest in 1844 where the type became known as 'Le Buddicom'.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, a new {{inclined}} elevator was installed. It travels on a 10° angle for {{the first}} 98 ft, shifting its position horizontally 12 ft, and straight up for the 60 ft remainder of the climb. The elevator car stays level at all times during its movement {{because it has a}} gimbal-mounted <b>double</b> <b>frame.</b> Before the installation of the new elevator, the observatory had been reached by taking first one elevator, then climbing a flight of stairs to a second elevator.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Some Swedish {{examples}} of markings attached to documents {{that are to}} be kept secret. A single frame around the text indicates Hemlig, which can be equal to either Secret, Confidential or Restricted. <b>Double</b> <b>frames</b> means Kvalificerat hemlig, that is, Top Secret.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in 1876 with broad gauge wheels outside the standard <b>double</b> <b>frames.</b> Five more broad gauge locomotives {{were built in}} 1878, while from 1884 another 35 were converted from standard gauge to broad. All were eventually converted back to standard gauge.|$|R
50|$|The {{ice hockey}} rink {{measures}} 61 meters &times; 30 meters (200 ft &times; 98.5 ft) which is standard international size. New <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> half boards were installed in 2001, designed to switch to NHL rink dimensions or to be easily removed when other events than ice hockey take place. To maximize the view for spectators, a seamless protective glass barrier consisting of tempered glass panels clipped together at their top corners with clear plastic brackets is used instead of traditional Plexiglas with metal dividers.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wanted a}} special show just like Cineramaplays today ... I had Fantasia {{set for a}} wide screen. I had {{dimensional}} sound ... To get that wide screen I had the projector running sideways ... I had the <b>double</b> <b>frame.</b> But I didn't get to building my cameras or my projectors because the money problem came in ... The compromise was that it finally went out standard with dimensional sound. I think if I'd had the money and I could have gone ahead I'd have a really sensational show at that time."

5000|$|Number 8 {{was built}} in 1886 as a [...] broad gauge {{convertible}} 2-4-0 tandem compound, the low- and high-pressure piston rods sharing a common crosshead. It had 7 ft driving wheels, six plate frames and a high-pressure boiler rated at [...] The frames consisted of a <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> supporting the driving axleboxes, and an external frame from which the hornblocks for the leading wheels projected. Unsuccessful in its trials, it was never taken into stock or converted to [...] In 1894 the wheel centres were used in a conventional standard gauge 4-4-0, No. 8 of the Armstrong class.|$|E
50|$|The 1076 Class were 266 <b>double</b> <b>framed</b> 0-6-0 tank {{locomotives}} {{built by}} the Great Western Railway between 1870 and 1881; the last one, number 1287, was withdrawn in 1946. They are {{often referred to as}} the Buffalo Class following the naming of locomotive 1134.|$|R
50|$|In 1884 it was rebuilt as a strange-looking 2-2-2 tender {{locomotive}} {{with outside}} Stephenson's valve gear. In 1890 it was rebuilt with more conventional <b>double</b> <b>frames</b> and inside valve gear similar in style to the Queen Class. In this guise {{it was named}} Victoria in honour of Queen Victoria.|$|R
40|$|In our work, we {{have defined}} {{different}} types of double-framed fuzzy soft matrix. Operations of addition, multiplication and complement of double-framed fuzzy soft matrix are defined with examples. Some related propositions with proof is also worked out. Finally medical diagnosis problems have been solved using <b>double</b> <b>framed</b> fuzzy soft matrix...|$|R
50|$|However, in {{accordance}} with the fact that LCDs required much higher definition and more color depth as well as more frame rate, FPD-Link faced problems that input pixel data for LCDs increased exponentially and the number of LVDS cables soared as well. For example, full HD television (1920 x 1080 pixels) with a 10-bit color depth and <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> rate requires 24 FPD-Link differential pairs. Such a case has to adjust skews at the level of several hundreds of picoseconds because of much higher-speed clock and data rate. In addition, since LVDS requires a fixed clock frequency that concentrates spectrums, the interface systems have to minimize electromagnetic interference.|$|E
50|$|Then {{dimensions}} of these engines were largely {{the same as}} those of the Class IV b. However the <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> was dropped and replaced by a simple plate frame. The engine had a very short wheelbase and as a result good curve-running performance. In addition the carrying axle had a side play of 10 mm. It was returned to its centre position by sloping bearing surfaces (geneigte Doppelflächen). The grate area of the firebox turned out to be very small; as a result its steam generation was not particularly satisfactory. Trials with ribbed tubes did not produce any improvements. The large steam dome sat on the rear boiler section.|$|E
50|$|A {{steam hammer}} may {{have one or}} two {{supporting}} frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the dies more easily, while the <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|No. 36 had <b>double</b> <b>frames</b> for the 4 ft coupled {{wheels and}} an outside-frame bogie; {{cylinders}} were 20" [...] x 24". The long boiler and raised round-topped firebox create a harmonious impression, and the loco acquired the nickname [...] "The Crocodile". Among its innovative features included {{the use of}} Serve tubes.|$|R
5000|$|Twenty {{teams of}} two players each {{participated in the}} tournament. The top eight nations were seeded. As the host nation, Thailand was {{represented}} by two teams.
