5|$|By 1913 Silvester was {{suffering}} from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary seat. On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and then took the ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time. From September that year Horne attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school. Although he was not strong academically, he developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E

5000|$|The Motor Carrier was an English {{automobile}} built only in 1904. Designed as a 6 hp [...] "pleasure car", {{it could}} be converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle capable of carrying 900 lb (400 kg).|$|R

50|$|After {{closure of}} the {{passenger}} facilities the original goods station and the surrounding site proved to be ideal {{for the development of}} the main SER goods depot in London. New sidings were laid and the former passenger station was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station.|$|R
25|$|An amine {{functional}} group displaces the adjacent halide in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate an aziridine. Amino alcohols {{have the same}} reactivity, but the hydroxy group must first be converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leaving group. The cyclization of an amino alcohol is called a Wenker synthesis (1935), and that of a haloamine the Gabriel ethylenimine method (1888).|$|E
25|$|Ian Chappell won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on the suspect surface. Though it is a brave captain who puts the {{opposition}} in to bat Chappell {{had a difficult}} decision as the wicket could dry out <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> batting surface later in the match, though the prevailing opinion {{was that it would}} be better not to bat last on an under-prepared wicket.|$|E
25|$|In 1852 Wordsworth {{was elected}} Bishop of Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane, and was consecrated in Aberdeen early next year. He {{was a strong}} {{supporter}} of the establishment, but conciliatory towards the Free churches, and this brought him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of controversy. He was a voluminous writer, {{and was one of the}} company of revisers of the New Testament (1870–1881), among whom he displayed a conservative tendency.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} who gets what, {{it is common to}} divide the outcome [...] <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> allocation and <b>a</b> money transfer, [...] where [...] stands for <b>an</b> allocation of <b>goods</b> rendered or received as a function of type, and [...] stands for a monetary transfer as a function of type.|$|R
50|$|In addition, two tracks spur {{off at the}} {{northeast}} of the station, and lead <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> yard north of the station. Freight trains stopped there regularly before their demise on the East Rail Line in 2010; the yard has since been used occasionally for rolling stock deliveries.|$|R

25|$|Surrey lost wickets {{regularly}} in the reply on day two, Scott Newman resisting with 40, but by stumps on day two they were 93 for 3 - rain having limited the day's play to 40 overs, yet a result looked very probable. However, day three was rained off, and an unbeaten century from Rikki Clarke sent Surrey <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> position at 292 for 6, where they declared to leave Nottinghamshire 203 runs from 40 overs. Nottinghamshire made a good attempt at chasing it, but lost five wickets quickly for 90 runs to Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram. David Alleyne and Mark Ealham dug in before two quick wickets fell, but Ryan Sidebottom shut up shop with Smith to hold on for the draw.|$|E
25|$|In the east, Russia invaded {{with two}} armies. In response, Germany rapidly moved the 8th Field Army from its {{previous}} role as reserve {{for the invasion}} of France to East Prussia by rail across the German Empire. This army, led by general Paul von Hindenburg, defeated Russia {{in a series of}} battles collectively known as the First Battle of Tannenberg (17 August– 2 September). While the Russian invasion failed, it caused the diversion of German troops to the east, allowing the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne. This meant Germany failed to achieve its objective of avoiding a long, two-front war. However, the German army had fought its way <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defensive position inside France and effectively halved France's supply of coal. It had also killed or permanently crippled 230,000 more French and British troops than it itself had lost. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a more decisive outcome.|$|E
25|$|With {{the final}} Incursion {{imminent}} during the Secret Wars storyline, Doom usurps {{the power of}} the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man, collecting what he can of the destroyed multiverse and forming a new Battleworld consisting of different alternate realities. He also assumes the role of God and claims complete dominion of this new world and its inhabitants, controlling them into thinking he was always the almighty force of creation; he takes Sue as his wife, Franklin, and Valeria as his children, condemns the Human Torch to be the sun and Ben Grimm to be the Shield wall - he also rewrites his own history to resurrect the majority of those whose deaths he caused. Richards and a ragtag collection of heroes and villains that survived the destruction of all universes are able to challenge him and, with the help of Molecule Man, are able to take his power and restore the multiverse. Opting to heal rather than harm, Reed finally uses the Beyonder's power to heal Doom's face and fully turn him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, the Charfield railway {{disaster}} {{occurred when}} a southbound night-time mail train overran signals <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> train manoeuvring <b>into</b> these sidings {{and in the}} collision the mail train was diverted {{into the path of}} a northbound freight train. Gas from the mail train ignited and 15 people died in the blaze. According to some accounts, among them were two children whose identity was never established.|$|R
5000|$|From November 1872 [...] {{became a}} {{temporary}} terminus {{to relieve the}} main high level Bishopsgate station while the GER was building its new permanent terminus at [...] The latter opened in stages from February 1874, beginning with the first four platforms, until it was fully open from November 1875. At that time the original 1840 Bishopsgate station closed to passengers and was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> yard.|$|R

25|$|Because G is triangular, {{the degree}} of each vertex in a {{configuration}} is known, and all edges internal to the configuration are known, the number of vertices in G adjacent to a given configuration is fixed, and they are joined in a cycle. These vertices form the ring of the configuration; a configuration with k vertices in its ring is a k-ring configuration, and the configuration together with its ring is called the ringed configuration. As in the simple cases above, one may enumerate all distinct four-colorings of the ring; any coloring that can be extended without modification to a coloring of the configuration is called initially good. For example, the single-vertex configuration above with 3 or less neighbors were initially good. In general, the surrounding graph must be systematically recolored to turn the ring's coloring <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one, as {{was done in the}} case above where there were 4 neighbors; for a general configuration with a larger ring, this requires more complex techniques. Because of the large number of distinct four-colorings of the ring, this is the primary step requiring computer assistance.|$|E
25|$|On day three, however, Kent hit back. In 33 fiery overs before lunch, Amjad Khan and Min Patel both {{took two}} wickets, and despite more runs from Ervine - who {{finished}} with 74 - Hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch. However, Andy Bichel and Nic Pothas added 138 {{for the eighth}} wicket, as Hampshire eked out 325, with Bichel top-scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls. Kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and put a big target up for Hampshire, as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play, but Shane Watson took two quick wickets and Shaun Udal one, {{and all of a}} sudden it was up to Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall to save Kent, as they were 153 for 7 overnight. Kemp fell on the fourth morning, as Kent rolled over for 185, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs. A 95-run partnership between Sean Ervine and John Crawley put Hampshire <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> position at 139 for 1, but Hampshire failed to score quickly enough, and three wickets from Simon Cook could not quite force a victory as Hampshire hung on to finish on 241 for 8 and draw the match.|$|E
500|$|He {{began his}} {{football}} career with local teams including York Wednesday and York & District League club Dringhouses, and signed for Third Division club Darlington {{as an amateur}} in December 1932. According to the Sunderland Echo, he was [...] "speedy and gives promise of developing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> player". He played six league matches and scored once, in a 1–1 draw with Chester. He was not retained– after a disappointing season, Darlington named only five players on their retained list.|$|E
50|$|The L&GR {{was nearly}} {{bankrupt}} in 1844 and the SER leased its line from 1 January 1845. It became the Greenwich branch of that railway. Thereafter further developments were at London Bridge, and following a shunting accident during August 1850 which caused {{the collapse of}} {{a large part of the}} station roof, the SER closed Bricklayers' Arms terminus to passenger traffic in 1852 converting it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> facility.|$|R

500|$|He was {{a strong}} player with an {{excellent}} first touch, intelligence, and all round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder during his time at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the England under-23 side {{he was unable to}} translate his club form <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> international career, and was used as a stand-in for Trevor Brooking before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at Euro 1980. Bob Paisley described him as [...] "one of Liverpool's greatest players and probably the most underrated".|$|E
500|$|Konner and Rosenthal were {{rewriting}} the script even as sets were being constructed. Ari, Helena Bonham Carter's character, was originally a princess. She {{was changed to}} [...] "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening. Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character [...] "was supposed to turn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guy.

[...] "But Tim [...] and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{perceived}} leniency in {{her sentence}} provoked an uproar in Hong Kong for alleged preferential treatment. In particular, the presiding judge caused outrage {{when he said}} in his judgment that Bokhary had an [...] "unblemished background and was born <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> family with caring parents [...] an outstanding academic record". The comment highlighted the public perception of widening inequality and increasing disparities in the balance of political power between different social classes in Hong Kong. The judge came under pressure to reconsider his sentencing, but he declined to amend it upon review. Pundits also blamed the police for charging her with an offence carrying a lesser penalty; the Department of Justice was forced to appeal her sentence.|$|E
