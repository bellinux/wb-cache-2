25|$|Although {{these groups}} were {{distinct}} and stratified {{in relation to}} one another, the boundary between Tutsi and Hutu was somewhat open to social mobility. The Tutsi elite were defined by their <b>exclusive</b> <b>ownership</b> of land and cattle. Hutus, however, though disenfranchised socially and politically, could shed Hutuness, or kwihutura, by accumulating wealth, and thereby rising through the social hierarchy {{to the status of}} Tutsi.|$|E

25|$|On 30 January 2005, Libya {{held its}} first round of {{oil and natural gas}} {{exploration}} leases since the US ended sanctions: 15 areas were offered for auctions. In October 2005, a second bidding round was held under EPSA IV, with 51 companies taking part and nearly $500 million worth of new investment flowing into the country as a result. In December 2006, Libya held its third bidding round; however, PSAs were still being signed by NOC as of April 2007. Winners of Libyan exploration area are determined based on how high a share of production a company is willing to offer NOC. Whichever company offers NOC the greatest share of profits is likely to win. In addition, oilfield developers initially bear 100% of costs (exploration, appraisal, and training) for a 5-year minimum, while NOC retains <b>exclusive</b> <b>ownership.</b> Also included in Libyan licensing rounds was open competitive bidding and transparency, joint development and marketing of non-associated natural gas discoveries, standardized terms for exploration and production (E), and non-recoverable bonuses.|$|E

Rarely did they opt for the <b>exclusive</b> international <b>ownership</b> of a joint stock company in Greece and the dividing line  between foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment was not always clear.

25|$|Two {{weeks later}} on August 26, Viacom {{acquired}} Warner Communications and Warner-Amex's combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. {{as well as}} full ownership of Warner-Amex and the public shareholder interests in MTV Networks for $671.7 million. This gave Viacom <b>exclusive</b> <b>ownership</b> of both premium channels through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares for Warner's 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel, and Warner-Amex's 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom had owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies – previously in ventures with TelePrompTer Corporation, and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable – from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express' interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money. The subsidiary would eventually be renamed Showtime Networks, Inc. in 1988. Ironically, {{four years after the}} company sold its interests in Showtime and The Movie Channel, Warner Communications would acquire competitors HBO and Cinemax, when the company merged with Time Inc. in 1989 to form Time Warner.|$|E
500|$|Amid the {{dismantling}} of apartheid in the early 1990s, various political parties competed over Biko's legacy, with several saying they were the party that Biko would support if he were still alive. AZAPO in particular claimed <b>exclusive</b> <b>ownership</b> over Black Consciousness. In 1994, the ANC issued a campaign poster suggesting that Biko {{had been a member}} of their party, which was untrue. Following the end of apartheid when the ANC formed the government, they were accused of appropriating his legacy. In 2002, AZAPO issued a statement declaring that [...] "Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon" [...] and that the ANC was [...] "scandalously" [...] using Biko's image to legitimise their [...] "weak" [...] government. Members of the ANC have also criticised AZAPO's attitude to Biko; in 1997, Mandela said that [...] "Biko belongs to us all, not just AZAPO." [...] On the anniversary of Biko's death in 2015, delegations from both the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters independently visited his grave. In March 2017, the South African President Jacob Zuma laid a wreath at Biko's grave to mark Human Rights Day.|$|E

John Marsh, owner of Rancho Los Meganos in Contra Costa County, {{had a lot}} to do with this. He sent letters to influential people in the eastern United States extolling the climate, soil and potential for agriculture in California, with the deliberate purpose of encouraging Americans to immigrate to California and lead to its becoming part of the United States. He succeeded. His letters were published in newspapers throughout the East, and started the first wagon trains rolling toward California. He also invited them to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, so the Rancho Los Meganos became the terminus of the California trail.|$|R

60|$|The ridiculous planet, {{wavering}} bat-like through space, {{on which}} it had been impossible for an innocent man to buy a suitable horse was a dream of the past, {{and he had the}} solid, sensible old earth under his feet once more. He mounted into the phaeton and drove off with his wife; he returned and gave each of the children a drive in succession. He told them that any of them could drive Billy as much as they liked, and he quieted a clamor for <b>exclusive</b> <b>ownership</b> on the part of each by declaring that Billy belonged to the whole family. To this day he cannot look back to those moments without tenderness. If Billy had any apparent fault, it was an amiable indolence. But this made him all the safer for the children, and it did not really amount to laziness. While on sale he had been driven in a provision cart, and had therefore the habit of standing unhitched. One had merely to fling the reins {{into the bottom of the}} phaeton and leave Billy to his own custody. His other habit of drawing up at kitchen gates was not confirmed, and the fact that he stumbled on his way to the doctor who pronounced him blameless was reasonably attributed to a loose stone at the foot of the hill; the misstep resulted in a barked shin, but a little wheel-grease, in a horse of Billy's complexion, easily removed the evidence of this.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} notion of {{ownership}} in economics, taking our point of departure in the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach. We criticize the <b>exclusive</b> identification of <b>ownership</b> with residual rights to control in this approach, and argue that economic organization may be rendered determinate under complete contracting (contrary to the GHM approach). Crucially, we argue that under complete contracting, some control rights may be appropriable because of measurement and enforcement costs. This holds {{the key to a}} theory of ownership that is not dependent on {{the notion of}} residual rights to control, but rather relies on appropriable control rights. However, the two perspectives may be complementary rather than rival. Ownership, property rights, complete and incomplete contracts...|$|R
5000|$|Within left-libertarianism, {{scholars}} such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka, and David Ellerman root {{an economic}} egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and land appropriation, combined with geoist or physiocratic views regarding the ownership of land and natural resources (e.g. those of John Locke and Henry George). Left-libertarians [...] "maintain that the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim <b>exclusive</b> private <b>ownership</b> of these resources {{to the detriment of}} others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property." [...] This position is articulated in contrast to the position of other libertarians who argue for a (characteristically labor-based) right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as land. Some left-libertarians of the Steiner-Vallentyne type support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources.|$|R
