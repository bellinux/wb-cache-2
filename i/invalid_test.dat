40|$|Abstract—When {{testing a}} Boolean expression, one should {{consider}} also the constraints among the variables contained in it. Constraints model interdependence among {{the conditions in}} the expressions. Only tests that satisfy the constraints. i. e. valid tests, are really useful and {{can be applied to}} test the expression. We present three ways to deal with such constraints: (1) ignoring them during test generation and removing <b>invalid</b> <b>tests</b> later, (2) including them in the expression as conjoint and again removing <b>invalid</b> <b>tests</b> later, and (3) considering them during the test generation process in order to generate only valid tests from the start. We introduce a general framework in which the three policies are implemented and compared over a set of Boolean expressions commonly used as benchmarks. Although the third policy requires a constraints solving technique for actual test generation, it presents several benefits: it generates smaller test suites and it may require less time for tests generation. Moreover, ignoring the constraints during test generation can reduce the fault detection capability of the tests.

This study compares conventional sweat testing to a new quantitative method, the CF Quantum® (CFQT) sweat test. This study tests the diagnostic accuracy and analytic validity of the CFQT. MethodsPreviously diagnosed CF patients and patients who required a sweat test for clinical indications were invited to have the CFQT test performed. Both conventional sweat testing and the CFQT were performed bilaterally on the same day. Pairs of data from each test are plotted as a correlation graph and Bland–Altman plot. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated {{as well as the}} means and coefficient of variation by test and by extremity. After completing the study, subjects or their parents were asked for their preference of the CFQT and conventional sweat testing. ResultsThe correlation coefficient between the CFQT and conventional sweat testing was 0. 98 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 97 – 0. 99). The sensitivity and specificity of the CFQT in diagnosing CF was 100 % (95 % confidence interval: 94 – 100 %) and 96 % (95 % confidence interval: 89 – 99 %), respectively. In one center in this three center multicenter study, there were higher sweat chloride values in patients with CF and also more <b>tests</b> that were <b>invalid</b> due to discrepant values between the two extremities. The percentage of <b>invalid</b> <b>tests</b> was higher in the CFQT method (16. 5 %) compared to conventional sweat testing (3. 8 %) (p< 0. 001). In the post-test questionnaire, 88 % of subjects/parents preferred the CFQT test. ConclusionsThe CFQT is a fast and simple method of quantitative sweat chloride determination. This technology requires further refinement to improve the analytic accuracy at higher sweat chloride values and to decrease the number of <b>invalid</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a unified {{solution to the}} GUI testing problem with the particular goals of automation and integration of tools and techniques used in various phases of GUI testing. These goals are accomplished by developing a GUI testing framework with a GUI model as its central component. For efficiency and scalability, a GUI is represented as a hierarchy of components, each used as a basic unit of testing. The framework also includes a test coverage evaluator, test case generator, test oracle, test executor, and regression tester. The test coverage evaluator employs hierarchical, event-based coverage criteria to automatically specify what to test in a GUI and {{to determine whether the}} test suite has adequately tested the GUI. The test case generator employs plan generation techniques from artificial intelligence to automatically generate a test suite. A test executor automatically executes all the test cases on the GUI. As test cases are being executed, a test oracle automatically determines the correctness of the GUI. The test oracle employs a model of the expected state of the GUI in terms of its constituent objects and their properties. After changes are made to a GUI, a regression tester partitions the original GUI test suite into valid test cases that represent correct input/output for the modified GUI and <b>invalid</b> <b>test</b> cases that no longer represent correct input/output. The regression tester employs a new technique to reuse some of the <b>invalid</b> <b>test</b> cases by repairing them...|$|E

Basically, the new procedure consists in applying the pulling force by means of reinforced bars already built in the specimen, either already by the specimen concrete casting or by subsequent boring and gluing, which are clamped in the machine during testing (Nieto et al. 2014). In this way, outfitting holes in the specimen is avoided thus lowering the ratio of <b>invalid</b> <b>tests,</b> due to the local fracture in the pulling holes, practically to nil.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a mean {{adjustment}} scheme for unit root {{tests in the}} presence of deterministic seasonality is discussed. The Cauchy estimator for autoregressive processes provides some advantages in the application to unit root tests. In particular, it allows for asymptotically standard normal tests and does not require any tabulation of the critical values. The approach can also be employed for testing seasonal unit root. In both cases, a special scheme of mean adjustment based on recursive coefficients, so-called recursive mean adjustment, is essential to maintain the martingale property of regressors. However, the straightforward recursive estimation of seasonal dummies in the case of deterministic seasonal effects leads to a strong positive bias of the estimated autoregressive parameter and therefore to <b>invalid</b> <b>tests.</b> This paper shows how to overcome this problem and to use the Cauchy estimator for unit root testing {{in the presence of}} deterministic seasonality.

Difficulty arises when (i) disturbances are correlated across cross section; (ii) data are subjected to outliers / shocks.

However, in reality, it is also possible to have local shocks which affect the innovations in the model. The question that usually arises is whether cross dependencies does exist among innovations in the presence of outliers.

The model considered accommodates a linear time trend and stationary regressors, as well as multiple I(1) regressors. We establish consistency and derive the limit distribution of the nonlinear least squares estimator. The estimator is consistent under fairly general conditions but the convergence rate and the limiting distribution are critically dependent upon the type of the regression function. For integrable regression functions, the parameter estimates converge at a reduced n^{ 1 / 4 } rate and have mixed normal limit distributions. On the other hand, if the regression functions are homogeneous at infinity, the convergence rates {{are determined by the}} degree of the asymptotic homogeneity and the limit distributions are non-Gaussian. It is shown that nonlinear least squares generally yields inefficient estimators and <b>invalid</b> <b>tests,</b> just as in linear nonstationary regressions.
