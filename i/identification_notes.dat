50|$|Volume 1 {{is a field}} guide. A nine-page {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by 180 colour plates, each with an accompanying text page giving brief <b>identification</b> <b>notes,</b> and, for most species, range maps. In addition to the 69 plates by Anderton, eleven other artists contributed, including Ian Lewington and Bill Zetterström. Volume 2: Attributes and Status contains more detailed supporting texts for every species. Twelve other authors are listed as having contributed to this volume, including Per Alström, Nigel Collar and Craig Robson. This volume opens with an appreciation, written by Bruce Beehler, of S. Dillon Ripley, who initiated the work {{which led to the}} book, and after whom it is named. This is followed by a 24-page introduction. The bulk of the book, from pages 41 to 601, consists of individual species accounts; each of these includes sections on identification, occurrence, habits and voice (this latter section accompanied by sonograms for many species). There are ten appendices, including a hypothetical list, a list of rejected species, a summary of taxonomic changes, a glossary, a gazetteer, and a list of institutions holding major collections of South Asian bird specimens.|$|E
5000|$|Frith died in 1982; when a {{thoroughly}} revised and updated edition (...) was issued in 1986 the consultant editors were Richard Schodde and Sonia Tidemann. Chisholm's foreword {{was replaced by}} one by the new editors, the chapters {{at the back of}} the book were moved to the front, and new material (e.g. a chapter on “The functions of feathers”) was added. In the foreword Schodde and Tidemann say”One of the many purposes of this book is to provide the information that will allow general appreciation of the life style and habitat needs of Australia's birds. From the moment it appeared, the Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds became the pacemaker as the most comprehensive and authoritative of popular references to the birds of our continent. Its authority stemmed - as now - from its association with the CSIRO's Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research. Most of the first edition, published in 1976, was compiled by staff of the Division; its then Chief, Dr H. J. Frith, was consultant editor.“The second edition seeks to maintain that standing, its input increased by members of the Division and augmented by additions from other new contributors whose help- we gratefully acknowledge.“Because few field guides were then available, the first edition featured <b>identification</b> <b>notes</b> and the biology of our birds. Many gaps have since been filled, allowing us to stress their habits more: where they live, what they feed on and how they breed, aspects not emphasised in any other publication on Australian birds.“The comprehensiveness of the new text springs from a careful updating of information from research on all species. Readers who skim its surface will notice at once the expanded text, the corrections in classification - though these are few - and the many changes to maps of distribution, based on the Atlas of Australian Birds just published by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. Others who dig deeper will find that the accounts of most species have been revised extensively and many completely rewritten, including all additional species; not one species has been left unadjusted.” ...|$|E

40|$|Presented at Society of Hospital Medicine, 05 / 18 / 2013, National Harbor, MDBackground Many {{problems}} exist regarding inpatient code status: {{advance directives}} are rarely completed in outpatient and inpatient settings; patients’ preferences regarding code status {{are often not}} elicited; physicians do not provide adequate information to allow patients {{to make informed decisions}} about code status; code status discussions are often delayed during an admission until it is too late for the patients to participate; and providers inappropriately extrapolate DNR orders to limit other treatments (such as artificial nutrition, ICU admission, etc.) Most hospitals default to “Full Code” as the status for patients admitted, particularly in patients with whom a code status discussion cannot or has not taken place. In many cases, confirmation of “Full Code” does not occur later when these discussions become possible. These problems can result in patients receiving care they would not wish or choose. Purpose At the University of New Mexico (UNM), an academic safety net hospital, a multidisciplinary Advance Directives Task Force formed to address these issues. An initial survey found that < 2 % of inpatients had advance directives. The goals of the task force were to improve the above issues around code status and increase advance directive completion, in an effort to improve patient care at end of life. Description A multi-disciplinary team at the University of New Mexico met regularly for 2 years to address these concerns. Quality improvement measures included: 1) 	A revision of the hospital Code Status Policy including the following: a) 	All adult admissions will have a code status discussion, identification of a surrogate decision maker, and a code status note written b) 	Code status orders are written for all adult inpatients and include the options of Presumed Full Code (for patients with whom a discussion cannot take place on admission), Confirmed Full Code (after discussion takes place with patient or surrogate), or DNR (eliminating “partial code” status orders) 2) 	Process Improvements included: a) 	Modification of existing orders and order sets in EMR b) 	Development of standardized templates for code status discussion and surrogate decision maker <b>identification</b> <b>notes</b> c) 	Revision of patient handouts about Advance Directives in literacy appropriate language d) 	Education for physicians about “how to have a code status discussion” e) 	Hospital-wide education to all staff about these changes Conclusions As a specialty, hospital medicine needs to take a more proactive role in ensuring that patients make informed decisions and receive all and only the care they desire. To make this cultural change in our nationwide practice, we submit these standards we hope to be adopted by other institutions including the use of ‘presumed’ and ‘confirmed’ code statuses, the expectation to have code status discussions on all admissions with identification of surrogate decision maker, and to support increased education to hospitalist in engaging in these discussions...|$|E
