500|$|Hoglan {{worked as}} a roadie for the band after their {{lighting}} guy {{did not show up}} one night, and performed Lombardo's soundchecks. Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|.....here is none {{today who}} can replace the noble personality, that keen {{energetic}} brain ever {{ready to give}} of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. [...] "It will crown my life" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called [...] "God's noblest waterway".|$|E
5000|$|For Example, [...] తను ఇంటికి వెళదాము అన్నాడు [...] (tanu iṃṭiki veḻadāmu annāḍu)means, <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> {{will go to}} home, literally, <b>He</b> <b>Said,</b> [...] "We'll go home".|$|R

2500|$|Following {{a series}} of low scores, Best was dropped after just three Tests. He felt aggrieved: [...] "I was the most {{disappointed}} and hurt man in the world, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> were 3–0 up, no pressure was on us and I was unceremoniously discarded. I {{never had a chance}} to develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Brodovitch said [...] "astonish me" [...] many times, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> must {{enter the}} future and {{constantly}} change the old and seek the new. My own BREAKING THE LIGHT images reinvent the art of photography for the digital age, just as he urged all his students and all {{who worked with him}} to do. He despised imitation of the past and said long ago that we must be like the Russian Astronaut Gagarin and rocked into the future with daring and passion. He was a giant ahead of [...] his time and he planted seeds of creativity that like the dragon seeds sprung up fully armored, and ready to astonish him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Down 3–2 in the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals {{against the}} rival New Jersey Devils, Messier confronted the New York media and {{publicly}} guaranteed a Game 6 victory. With fans and players {{on both sides}} reading the news headline, it then became a feat comparable to Babe Ruth's called shot and Joe Namath's Super Bowl III guarantee, and he backed it up by scoring a natural hat trick {{in the third period}} on an empty net goal with ESPN commentator Gary Thorne boasting, [...] "Do you believe it?! Do you believe it?! <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> will win game six and he has just picked up the hat trick!" [...] It helped the Rangers erase a two-goal deficit. The Rangers {{went on to win the}} series in a thrilling seventh game double overtime nail biter.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>we</b> {{just took}} {{furnished}} apartments in Highbury. He was that mean. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> I was extravagant, he didn't give me {{anything to be}} extravagant with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mother will be proud, indeed,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as <b>we</b> {{walked away}} together. 'Or {{she would be}} proud, if it wasn't sinful, Master Copperfield.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We've {{drawn up}} this notice,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'and <b>we</b> {{came to see}} if you'd sign it. Nearly all the other chaps in the team have.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{needs the}} hobbyists {{and this was}} illustrated by what happened eventually. When National Semiconductor, which made their own microprocessor chips in '77 or '78, decided they needed a BASIC [...] they asked, 'What's the most popular BASIC?' And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way. This was the marketing function and the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete antipathy of the company in question. There were other BASICs and, you know, some of them might even have been better. [...] was in a certain measure {{because of what we}} did, that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't do, we were thieves to do it, and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|When President Ronald Reagan signed {{legislation}} {{establishing the}} Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, {{she was at}} the event. Reagan called her to personally apologize for a remark he made during a nationally televised conference, where <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> would know in [...] "35 years" [...] whether or not King was a communist sympathizer. Reagan clarified his remarks came {{from the fact that the}} papers had been sealed off until the year 2027. King accepted the apology and pointed out the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations had not found any basis to suggest her husband had communist ties. On February 9, 1987, eight civil rights activists were jailed for protesting the exclusion of African-Americans during the filming of The Oprah Winfrey Show in Cumming, Georgia. Oprah Winfrey tried to find out why the [...] "community has not allowed black people to live there since 1912." [...] King was outraged over the arrests, and wanted members of the group, [...] "Coalition to End Fear and Intimidation in Forsyth County," [...] to meet with Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris to [...] "seek a just resolution of the situation." [...] On March 8, 1989, King lectured hundreds of students about the civil rights movement at the University of San Diego. King tried to not get involved in the controversy around the naming of the San Diego Convention Center after her husband. She maintained it was up to the [...] "people within the community" [...] and that people had tried to get her involved in with [...] "those kind of local situations." ...|$|E

60|$|Keel. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>We</b> might {{pray with}} the Spirit, {{and with the}} understanding, and with the Common Prayer-Book also.|$|E
60|$|He waved {{my thanks}} aside. 'It was a bagatelle,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> became friendly. He moved to my table, and we fraternized over our coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{covered by}} a {{mortgage}} to some Boston concern," [...] replied Earl. [...] "I asked Squire Dobson about it. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't get a penny." ...|$|E

6000|$|By and by Marlette shouted [...] "Stop!" [...] I {{never stopped}} quicker in my life. I {{asked what the}} matter was. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> {{were out of the}} path. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> must not try to go on till we found it again, for we were {{surrounded}} with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge down a thousand feet. I thought eight hundred would answer for me, and was about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he did," [...] said Jenny, [...] "only <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were {{to let him}} alone, {{and that}} he was not to get up till he felt quite rested." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>we</b> {{would like}} his {{establishment}} {{well enough to}} confine ourselves to it--said he never saw anybody who would go off and hunt up another man in his line after trading with him once.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hello!' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as <b>we</b> appeared. <b>He</b> jerked a thumb {{towards the}} classroom. 'I've locked dem in. What's doin', Buck?' he asked, {{indicating}} {{me with a}} languid nod.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I am mad? I dare say I am. I can't live without her." [...] Those {{were the first}} words <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when <b>we</b> shook hands.|$|R
