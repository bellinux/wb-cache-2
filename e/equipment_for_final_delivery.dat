This paper aims at explaining how inland waterways terminals can facilitate flows of goods using the academic framework of “fluidity” and “fixity” introduced by a few authors. As shipments require fluidity and face fixity constraints, inland waterways terminals should optimize flows of goods within a logistics network dealing with those requirements and constraints. The first part provides details of analytical tools based on the issues of fluidity and fixity; it defines several kinds of friction conflicting with fluidity.

40|$|The most {{economical}} {{means of}} transporting crude oil over long distances {{is through the}} use of very large and ultra large crude containers (VLCCs and ULCCs respectively). These ships require sea lane depths of more than 55 feet to navigate. Since no major U. S. port is deeper than 45 feet, special offloading procedures must be employed. One such procedure is lightering, the process of offloading crude oil from VLCCs to smaller vessels <b>for</b> <b>final</b> <b>delivery</b> to the port. A linked set of queuing models is developed in an effort to understand lightering operations better and to enhance tradeoff analyses. The model assumes that port service times, lightering vessel loading times and VLCC interarrival times are exponentially distributed, allowing us to model lightering vessel operations using a cyclic queuing model. VLCC delays are modeled using an approximate M/Ek/S queue. The two models are linked through a VLCC service time model. The sensitivity of the model to changes in key inputs as well as the likely impacts of the model's assumptions and approximations are discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for future studies. ...|$|R

Consequent economic and environmental conditions mean a number of Auckland {{concrete and}} asphalt plants are in turn expected to close, with new plants being built in more suitable locations, and possible modifications made to remaining plants for increased capacity.

The model provides simulation and analysis of the expected costs involved with each of the various scenarios of plant locations currently under consideration by the respective companies, accounting for the raw material, blending and transportation costs.

When the crate reaches the destination matching its label, it is opened and the bags (SDUs) removed only to become PDUs when someone reads the code of the destination post office.

40|$|Re-Chipping Equipment Issue: Some {{material}} {{produced from}} primary size-reduction equipment at a wood-waste processing facility is invariably larger than targeted feedstock specifications. Screening removes this oversized {{material from the}} acceptable material, which can then recycle through the primary size-reduction equipment. Also, the clean wood waste routed through a conventional chipper often contains a quantity of very small material (such as small trim ends) that is not effectively chipped. Further, the design of some processing facilities performs a two-stage size reduction in which the primary equipment produces large chunks of wood. After cleaning these chunks of contaminants they are then directed to secondary <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>final</b> size-reducing. Processing this smaller material through conventional size-reduction machinery produces an abundance of fines (very small particles) and a poor yield of acceptable product. Thus, operators might consider using specialized size-reduction <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> their small pieces of wood and oversized chips. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using re-chipping equipment to recover acceptable products from small pieces of wood waste and from the oversized material that primary size reduction produces.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the Multi Trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Release Dates (MTVRPTWR) and propose a memetic algorithm for its heuristic solution. This problem arises {{in the context}} of MODUM 1 project (founded by The French National Research Agency- ANR). In MODUM the development of an efficient system of mutualized distribution is studied. Carriers allowed to enter city centers (vans in the following) are parked at platforms located around the beltway where trucks continuously arrive during the day and are unloaded. Then, not all goods are available at the platforms {{at the beginning of the}} working day. This justifies the introduction of the concept of release date associated with the merchandise. Precisely, the release date represents the time merchandise is available at the platform <b>for</b> <b>final</b> <b>delivery.</b> <b>Final</b> distribution to customers is made by vans with limited capacity, due to laws restriction imposed and the narrowness of streets that characterize historical parts of downtowns. Then, they are allowed to accomplish several trips during the working day. This introduces the multi trip aspect. More formally, in the MTVRPTWR, a fleet of identical vehicles with limited capacity is based at the depot. A set of customer demands have to be fulfilled during the working day.
