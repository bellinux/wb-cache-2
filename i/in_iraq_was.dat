By then, many of Iraq's ashraf had accepted Umayyad sovereignty, and following the Umayyad victory in the Battle of Maskin, in which both Mus'ab and Ibn al-Ashtar were slain, Umayyad rule <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> reestablished.|$|E

5|$|The Brigade was alerted for {{deployment}} to Iraq {{in support}} of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2005. In the summer of 2006, it trained for three months at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to prepare. Its mission <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> to integrate other smaller engineer units and provide engineer support to the other Army units operating in the country. The brigade headquarters took command of several other engineer battalions during this deployment. Among the units under brigade's control was the 502nd Engineer Battalion based in Hanau, Germany which worked on bridges around Baghdad, {{as well as the}} 875th Engineer Battalion of the Arkansas Army National Guard based at Camp Striker and the active duty 92nd Engineer Battalion.

5|$|From late 2001, Hercules began {{flying into}} Afghanistan {{to support the}} SAS {{squadron}} deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No.36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As {{the first phase of the}} war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> killed on 27June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{had only}} a minor role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, providing a force element of about 40 Commandos from 4 RAR to support the Special Forces Task Group, {{which was based on}} an SASR Squadron. Following the invasion, the deteriorating security situation in Baghdad saw the deployment of a combined arms Security Detachment (SECDET), charged with protecting the Australian embassy and its personnel. Over a dozen companies of the regiment provided force elements to the various rotations. In February 2005 Prime Minister John Howard committed a battle group to southern Iraq to partially replace a Dutch unit that had been operating in the Governorate of Al Muthanna. The regiment's contribution to the first battle group, initially known as the Al Muthanna Task Group, was a rifle company, although the second and third rotations were led by 5/7 RAR and 2 RAR respectively. When Provincial Iraqi Control was declared in Al Muthanna in July 2006, AMTG 3, led by 2 RAR, was renamed the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)). The fifth battle group to serve <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> based on 5 RAR, by which time OBG(W) was operating in both the Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar Governorates {{as a part of the}} British Multi-National Division South East (MND(SE)). (AMTG 1, OBG(W) 2 and OBG(W) 4 were all based on cavalry regiment headquarters). During this time elements of the regiment conducted counterinsurgency operations until withdrawn in mid-2008. Casualties in Iraq included one member of the regiment who was accidentally killed.|$|E
