5|$|Undrafted by a National Hockey League (NHL) club, Burrows went {{professional}} in 2002–03 with the Greenville Grrrowl of the ECHL, a third-tier minor league. Late in his professional rookie season, {{he transferred to}} the Baton Rouge <b>Kingfish</b> and finished with a combined 32 points in 66 games between the two teams. The following season, in 2003–04, {{he returned to the}} South Division, as he was signed by the Columbia Inferno. Early in the season, he was signed by Columbia's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, on October 21, 2003, having been scouted by Moose general manager Craig Heisinger. He appeared in two AHL games for Manitoba before being sent back down to the ECHL. Shortly after his return, he was suspended for three games and fined an undisclosed amount by the league for abusing officials during a game on October 24 against the Greensboro Generals. Later on in the season, he was named to the 2004 ECHL All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and recorded one assist. He went on to finish the season with 29 goals and 73 points, second in points among Columbia players to league-scoring champion Tim Smith.|$|E

25|$|These designs {{had reached}} the A-11 stage when the program was reviewed. The A-11 was {{competing}} against a Convair proposal called <b>Kingfish,</b> of roughly similar performance. However, the <b>Kingfish</b> included a number of features that greatly reduced its radar cross-section, which was seen as favorable to the board. Lockheed responded with a simple update of the A-11, adding twin canted fins instead of a single right-angle one, and adding {{a number of areas}} of non-metallic materials. This became the A-12 design. On 26 January 1960, the CIA ordered 12 A-12 aircraft.|$|E

40|$|From introduction: Fishes in {{the family}} Carangidae {{commonly}} known as Jacks or <b>Kingfishes</b> are generally characterised by a silvery ovate body with s mall insignificant cycloid scales,a lateral line with curved anterior portion and a posterior straight portion bearing scules, a moderate mouth usually with feeble teeth, no dorsal and anal finlets, and a deeply forked caudal with a slender peduncle. A horizontally forwardly directed spine from the dorsal pterygiophore visible {{in front of the}} dorsal fin in shrunken or dried specimens, and the first two anal spines separate from the third {{and the rest of the}} fin are more pronounced in juvenile specimens...|$|R
500|$|Using an {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "The River City", Jacksonville has a culture {{centered on the}} St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest <b>kingfishing</b> tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as {{does most of the}} commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.|$|R
50|$|Caranx is a genus of {{tropical}} to subtropical marine fishes in the jack family Carangidae, {{commonly known as}} jacks, trevallies and <b>kingfishes.</b> They are moderate- to large-sized, deep-bodied fishes which are distinguished from other carangid genera by specific gill raker, fin ray and dentition characteristics. The genus is represented in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, inhabiting both inshore and offshore regions, ranging from estuaries and bays to deep reefs and offshore islands. All species are powerful predators, taking a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, while they in turn are prey to larger pelagic fishes and sharks. A number of fish in the genus have a reputation as powerful gamefish and are highly sought by anglers. They often make up high amounts of the catch in various fisheries, but are generally considered poor to fair table fishes.|$|R
25|$|In marine environments {{trolling}} {{is used in}} big-game fishing {{to catch}} large offshore or open-water species such as tuna and marlin. Saltwater anglers also troll for inshore species such as bluefish, <b>kingfish</b> and various jacks.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{industry}} employs about 2,000 persons, and the fleet consists {{of more than}} 500 powered boats. The catch in 2000 was 3,100 metric tons. Flying fish, dolphin fish, tuna, turbot, <b>kingfish,</b> and swordfish are among the main species caught. A fisheries terminal complex opened at Oistins in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} most {{commonly}} referred to as the 'bluefin trevally', with the species's distinctive blue fins contributing to most of its other common names. These include bluefin jack, bluefin <b>kingfish,</b> blue ulua, omilu, bluefinned crevalle and spotted trevally. The species has many other non-English names due to its wide distribution.|$|E
40|$|Micropogonias undulatus, spot Leiostomus xanthurus and <b>kingfishes</b> Menticirrhus spp., {{as well as}} {{the active}} {{metabolic}} rates (RA) of M. undulatus and L. xanthurus were investigated to facilitate inter and intraspecific comparisons of their energetic ecology. The RR of M. undulatus and L. xanthurus were typical for fishes with similar lifestyles. The RR of Menticirrhus spp. were elevated rela-tive to those of M. undulatus and L. xanthurus, but below those of high-energy-demand species such as tunas Thunnus spp. and dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus. Repeated-measures non-linear mixed-effects models were applied to account for within-individual autocorrelation and corrected for non-constant variance typical of noisy RA data sets. Repeated-measures models incorporat-ing autoregressive first-order [AR(1) ] and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) covariances provided significantly superior fits, more precise parameter estimates (i. e. reduced s. e.) and y-intercept estimates that more closely approximated measured RR for M. undulatus and L. xanthurus than standard least-squares regression procedures...|$|R
50|$|Caranx {{was created}} by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1801 to {{accommodate}} a new species he had described, Caranx carangua (the crevalle jack), which was later found to be a junior synonym of Scomber hippos, which in turn was transferred to Caranx. The early days of carangid taxonomy had over 100 'species' designated as members of the genus, most of which were synonyms, and a number of genera were created which were later synonymised with Caranx. Caranx took authority over these other genera names due to its prior description, rendering the rest as invalid junior synonyms. Today, after extensive reviews of the family, 18 species are considered valid by major taxonomic authorities Fishbase and ITIS, although many other species are unable to be properly validated due to poor descriptions. The fish in the genus are commonly referred to as jacks, trevallies or <b>kingfishes.</b> Like the genus Carangoides, the word Caranx is derived from the French carangue, used for some fishes of the Caribbean.|$|R

25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose <b>kingfish</b> and onion <b>kingfish)</b> is a species of {{relatively}} small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls, and seine nets. It is also of minor importance to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.|$|E

50|$|This small Spanish river has {{its origin}} in Puertas, near Ledesma, in the {{province}} of Salamanca, and it is about 45 km long. The Uces River, tributary of the Douro River and formed by the confluence of multiple streams, is named so after the crossing village Las Uces. It is a river with a huge flow during winter and spring, which sometimes creates floods that routinely cross all the old stone bridges. By contrast, the river is almost dry during the summer months.The Uces River, in its last part before merging with the Douro River, has eroded the surrounding granite landscape and it has formed {{one of the most famous}} waterfalls of the area, the Smoking Waterfall ("Pozo de los Humos") which is part of the Uces River. This spectacular waterfall is about 40 m high.As wetland, the environment of the Uces River hosts a rich fauna, with a number of herons and egrets, birds of prey (golden eagle, peregrine falcon and eagle owl), the white stork (occasionally you can see couples of black storks passing by), <b>kingfishes</b> and other various birds including mallards as well as otters. Dragonflies and autochthonous mackerels (Achondrostoma Salmantinum), are now seen frequently.|$|R
25|$|Fishing {{has been}} a minor {{part of the economy}} in the past, and recently, {{aquaculture}} has come to prominence in the bay, with Yellowtail <b>Kingfish,</b> mulloway and tuna held in large cages.

25|$|The blacktip trevally, Caranx heberi (also {{known as}} the blacktip <b>kingfish</b> and {{yellowtail}} <b>kingfish),</b> is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The blacktip trevally is distributed throughout the tropical to subtropical Indian and West Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Fiji, Japan and northern Australia in the east. It inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, preferring moderately deep clear waters over rocky and coral reefs. The blacktip trevally is easily distinguished by its yellow fins and a dark upper caudal fin lobe which gives the species its common name, as well as a host of other anatomical features. The species is known to reach a maximum size of 1 m. It is a benthopelagic predator, commonly forming small shoals where it takes a variety of fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans as prey. Little is known of reproduction in the species, and spawning is assumed to take place in more tropical regions of its range, with juveniles known to inhabit bays and large estuaries. Blacktip trevally are often caught using hook and line and various nets in commercial fisheries although don't make up {{a large part of the}} market. They are also popular with anglers due to their fighting ability and decent table qualities.|$|E
25|$|C. ignobilis is most {{commonly}} referred to as the giant trevally (or giant <b>kingfish)</b> due to its large maximum size, with this often abbreviated to simply GT by many anglers. Other names occasionally used include lowly trevally, barrier trevally, yellowfin jack (not to be confused with Hemicaranx leucurus), Forsskål's Indo-Pacific jack fish and Goyan fish. In Hawaii, the species is almost exclusively referred to as ulua, often in conjunction with the prefixes black, white, or giant.
