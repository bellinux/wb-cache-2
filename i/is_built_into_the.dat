5|$|Honiara {{has three}} main stadiums, {{the largest of}} which is Lawson Tama Stadium, {{considered}} to be the national stadium of Solomon Islands. The stadium, funded by FIFA, <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hillside and can hold roughly 10,000 people. The stadium hosted the 2012 OFC Nations Cup. The most recent and most prolific winners of the Telekom S-League, Koloale FC and Solomon Warriors FC, respectively, are both based out of the city.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is {{set into}} {{the end of the}} rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side {{was too close to}} the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The walls stretch {{along the}} south of the town with eight towers and two gatehouses. The Upper Gate formed the main inland {{entrance}} to the town during the medieval period, and, in addition to its twin towers, was originally protected by a stone barbican, of which some stonework still remains â€“ a rare survival for town barbicans of this period. A gatekeeper would have lived over the entrance during the medieval period. The original defensive ditch and drawbridge have been filled in, however, and replaced by a modern road. The second gatehouse, Mill Gate, was designed to allow access to the royal watermill that lay just outside the main town, and similarly features twin protective towers. In between the two gatehouses are the remains of Llywelyn's Hall, a grand building originally built into the town walls by Edward I before being dismantled and moved to Caernarfon Castle in 1316. Further along the walls is the mock-Gothic archway built in 1846 to accommodate the local railway, possibly drawing on similar designs used in Chester. A unique set of twelve medieval latrines <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> southern town walls, first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century.|$|E

Brick pilasters rise to the corbelled flat roof with unusual projecting round arches. Along the south facade are two gabled entrance porches whose arches have radiating stone voussoirs.

25|$|Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases the}} locking mechanism <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cleat instead of the pedal. The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crRNAs {{and is therefore}} likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage. RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.|$|E
