40|$|Concrete is {{a widely}} used vital {{material}} in the construction world. Producing cement in huge amount in factories directly influences the greenhouse gases emission. Reductions in getting good quality limestone directly affect the production of good quality cement. The cost of construction also gets escalated and also leaving the waste materials to the environment directly can cause environmental problem. Hence the reuse of waste material has been emphasized. Waste {{can be used to}} produce new products or can be used as admixtures so that natural resources are used more efficiently and the environment is protected from waste deposits. In studying the compressive strength and split tensile strength of concrete made by using <b>fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> particles to ordinary conventional concrete. This reports the results of an experimental investigation carried out to study the effects on <b>fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> particles, on strength development of concrete. Fly ash is added with cement and glass particles is added to the fine aggregate with some percentage in the mixture of concrete to determine the compressive strength and split tensile strength of concrete at 7 & 28 days. The comparison was made between conventional concrete, concrete with <b>fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> particles. Cement and fine aggregate is partially replaced with 10, 20, 30 and 40 % of <b>fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> particles respectively by weight.

This paper discloses {{results of an}} investigation concerning the performance of <b>fly</b> ash/waste <b>glass</b> alkaline-based mortars with recycled aggregates reinforced by hemp fibres exposed to accelerated carbon dioxide curing. Compressive strength, carbon footprint and cost were studied on it. The results show that hemp fibres lead to a reduction on mechanical properties but {{not as high as}} reported by others. A high correlation was found between compressive and flexural strength The results also show that accelerated curing provides a high carbon sequestration.

40|$|A {{review of}} all {{penetrating}} eye injuries {{treated by the}} Manchester Eye Hospital over four years (1 February 1982 - 31 January 1986) was undertaken. One hundred and ninety-six penetrating eye injuries were seen, of which 16 (8 - 2 %) were due to road traffic accidents. Eight patients (nine eyes) were seen in the 12 {{months prior to the}} introduction of the seat-belt legislation on 1 February 1983. None of these patients was wearing a seat-belt whereas two of the eight patients (10 eyes) seen after the seat-belt legislation were. Both these patients suffered severe visual loss due to intraocular glass from shattered windscreens. Three patients had bilateral penetrating eye injuries, one before and two after the seat-belt legislation. Two of the nine eyes involved prior to the legislation and three of the 10 eyes after the legislation had an eventual visual acuity of 6 / 12 or better. In the majority of patients, failure to wear seat-belts or defective use is to blame. <b>Flying</b> <b>glass</b> from shattered toughened windscreens is a preventable danger. Nine of the 16 patients were first seen in the general accident and emergency department and, of these, seven did not have visual acuities recorded prior to referral to an ophthalmologist.

40|$|As now a day’s {{disposal}} {{of solid waste}} is becoming a major problem and therefore some percentage of the waste {{in the form of}} <b>fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> powder is used to reduce the pollution caused by these elements. The aim of this project is to minimize the use of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) by the replacement of fly Ash (FA) and Glass Powder (GP) in varying proportions and to reduce the effect of solid waste generated due to its daily increasing disposal problems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} glass {{addition}} on the processing, physical properties and microstructure of lightweight aggregate made from lignite {{coal fly ash}} from the Megalopolis power station in Greece has been investigated. Fly ash/glass mixes have been rapidly sintered at temperatures between 1040 and 1120 °C in a rotary furnace, and the density, water absorption and pellet strength determined. Sintering 60 : 40 <b>fly</b> ash:waste <b>glass</b> mixes at 1120 °C produced lightweight aggregate with a mean density of 1. 35 g/cm 3, water absorption of ∼ 16 % and crushing strength of 7. 3 MPa.

The work indicates that Megalopolis fly ash combined with waste glass {{can be used to}} manufacture lightweight aggregate with properties comparable to commercially available products. <b>Fly</b> ash and <b>glass</b> are potential resources that are currently waste materials in Greece. The processing involving pelletising and sintering in a rotary kiln is similar to that required for other commercially available lightweight aggregates manufactured from shales, clays and slate, and therefore processing costs are expected to be similar.

50|$|For a {{short time}} in the early 1980s, one E-4B National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) also had ALCS {{equipment}} installed onboard during a test proof-of-concept program. Originally, SAC planned for a whole fleet of E-4Bs to replace all of the existing EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft in a program known as the Advanced Airborne Command Post.
