A royal warrant was granted by Princess Mary Adelaide in 1895 and by King George V in 1911.

500|$|On 18 August 1980, after {{a show in}} Minneapolis, Ward {{quit the}} band. [...] "It was {{intolerable}} {{for me to get}} on the stage without Ozzy. And <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where [...] "He might as well be a Martian". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{performed}} on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of {{the pressures of the}} road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. [...] "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. [...] "I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake." [...] Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] to their set list.|$|E

Whitney's departure was around the time when she was an alcoholic. In an interview in 1988, Whitney blamed her alcoholism and anorexia at the time for being released by the series. She later explained in an interview with Starlog magazine to promote , that due to being adopted, she had a fear of rejection when she was younger which stemmed from her mother giving her away, and linked this to Star Trek saying [...] "when I was let go from Star Trek, it was a psychic pain which pushed me into alcoholism.

500|$|Despite Hammond's best attempts, McCabe {{was able}} to gain the strike and runs came quickly. McCabe reached his century in 140 minutes and England {{declined}} to take the new ball while he was batting. By lunch, he and Barnett had added 67 in only 50 minutes, although the latter had made only 20 of these; the total was 6/261, with McCabe on 105. Having reached his century, McCabe lifted his scoring rate, scoring his last 132 runs in 95 minutes. Boundaries came much more readily and he took 44 runs from a three over spell by leg spinner Doug Wright. As {{he ran out of}} partners, he became more aggressive; in the last ten overs of his innings, he took 80% of the strike and hit 16 boundaries. He was the last man out, attempting to loft the spin of Verity, after a final wicket partnership with Leslie Fleetwood-Smith of 77 in 28 minutes, of which he scored 72. He finished with 232 from 235 minutes with 34 boundaries and one six, an innings in which Bradman summoned his players not to miss a ball, as [...] "they would never see anything like it again." [...] Bradman later said that McCabe [...] "held us all spellbound", and it was reported that the Australian captain trembled while watching the innings. While McCabe was at the crease, his partners contributed a total of only 58 runs, meaning that he had outscored them by a ratio of 4:1. Upon his return to the pavilion Bradman greeted him with the words: [...] "If I could play an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan". This has also been reported as Bradman saying [...] " [...] I wish I could bat like that". Bradman later wrote that [...] "Towards the end [...] I could scarcely watch the play. My eyes filled as <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> in the glory of his shots". It was regarded by English captains Arthur Gilligan and Bob Wyatt to be the best innings that they had ever witnessed, as did former England bowler Sydney Barnesregarded {{as one of the best}} of all timewho said that he would not have been able to stop McCabe. [...] Neville Cardus said that the innings was one of the greatest in Test history. Wisden reported that McCabe played [...] "an innings the equal of which has probably never been seen in the history of Test cricket; for the best part of four hours he maintained a merciless punishment of the bowling". McCabe’s biographer Jack McHarg said that the innings “was a sort of encyclopedia of attacking batsmanship, a triumph of character, technique and judgement”. Cardus said ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, John Sayer, {{a member}} St Peter's {{congregation}} was appointed chief cook to King Charles II. Sayer was {{a wealthy man}} and lived in Berkhamsted Place and benefactor of the town. He was known to Samuel Pepys, who wrote of him in his Diary. In 1661, Pepys wrote [...] "...I went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King's Privy Kitchen to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, and there {{we had a good}} slice of beef or two to our breakfast, and from thence he took us into the wine cellar where, by my troth, we were very merry, and <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> too much wine, and all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> so much wine that I was not fit for business." [...] Upon his death in 1682, John Sayer left £1000 in his will {{for the construction of a}} row of almshouses on Berkhamsted High Street, containing twelve rooms for the habitation of six poor widows. The endowment also provided for a weekly allowance of two shillings and a fuel allowance for each widow. The almshouses, which are still in existence today, were completed in 1684 and bear an inscription on the front, [...] "A gift of John Sayer, 1684". Sayer's elaborate marble tomb stands in the Lady chapel of St Peter's.|$|E
2500|$|The diary gives a {{detailed}} account of Pepys's personal life. He liked wine, plays, and the company of other people. He also spent time evaluating his fortune and his place in the world. He was always curious and often acted on that curiosity, as he acted upon almost all his impulses. Periodically, he would resolve to devote more time to hard work instead of leisure. For example, in his entry for New Year's Eve, 1661, he writes: [...] "I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine..." [...] The following months reveal his lapses to the reader; by 17 February, it is recorded, [...] "Here <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> wine upon necessity, being ill for the want of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 23, 2012, {{two days}} {{following}} the incident at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Green Day announced that Armstrong was seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. As a result, scheduled appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Ellen DeGeneres Show were canceled. According to Claudia Suarez Wright, Tre Cool's ex-wife {{and the mother of}} Armstrong's godson, Armstrong had been drinking heavily in Las Vegas prior to the iHeartMusic Festival, following approximately one year of sobriety. Armstrong gave an interview to Rolling Stone in March 2013 in which he admitted, [...] "I've been trying to get sober since 1997, right around Nimrod". Armstrong discussed how during the 21st Century Breakdown tour in 2009–2010, [...] "There were meltdowns on that tour that were huge". Armstrong detailed his addiction and in particular how it had escalated in the months prior to the release of the Trilogy albums and the performance at iHeart stating that during the summer while touring in Europe, [...] "I was at my pill-taking height at that time, medicating the shit out of myself". Armstrong gave details of a gig at Irving Plaza in New York just over a week before the iHeart incident he [...] "Threw back four or five beers before we went on and probably had four or five when we played. Then <b>I</b> <b>drank</b> my body weight in alcohol after that. I ended up hungover on the West Side Highway, laying in a little park." [...] Green Day subsequently canceled all remaining concert dates for 2012 and early 2013 as Armstrong continued dealing with his personal problems. In late December, the band announced they would return to touring at the end of March. Armstrong later admitted that the substances he had been abusing were alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia.|$|E
