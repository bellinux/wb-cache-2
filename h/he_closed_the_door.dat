60|$|Borrowdean came {{slowly into}} the room. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after her. She sat down. She {{hesitated to}} begin.|$|E
60|$|We {{followed}} John {{into his}} study, and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind us.|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON (smiling). No, no: it's all right. All right. (She goes.) That's a good girl. (<b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and returns}} to Judith.) ...|$|R
50|$|As Babar {{finishes}} his tale, {{he finds that}} his children have all gone to sleep. Right after <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> they re-enact scenes from the story, until their father tells them {{to get back to}} bed.|$|R
5|$|Lonnie is {{repelled}} by his uncle's treatment of Homer and Alma {{and leaves the}} ranch after his grandfather's funeral, uncertain if he will ever return. When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. Hud {{goes back into the}} Bannon house alone; as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>the</b> final fade-out is the window shade's pull-ring swaying.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood on}} the landing with him. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading into the sitting-room.|$|E

60|$|I {{nodded and}} <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and disappeared. Fenton would have gone, too, but I stopped him.|$|E
2500|$|..... completes what, perhaps, may {{be termed}} a trilogy; for, though very {{different}} in scope, {{each of the three}} books deals with certain conceptions that have an elemental kinship. With this book, the author believes that <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> so far as he is concerned, on a particular phase of constructive thought." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{proceedings}} when {{he entered}} it were but a poor compliment to his host. Not until he had poked and pried into every corner did <b>he</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Then, not content with locking it, he tilted a chair beneath the handle, and placing his pistol beneath his pillow, fell fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> oaken <b>door</b> {{in front}} of the picture, and locked it.|$|R

60|$|I {{followed}} him {{down into his}} office. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and set his hat down upon the desk.|$|E
50|$|Between June 1640 and November 1642 he was {{appointed}} Legate in Bologna which he ruled with his usual authoritative way of acting.

60|$|I thanked him, and we parted. Just as <b>he</b> was <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>he</b> {{looked in}} again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> cabin <b>door</b> behind him, and, {{crossing}} over, laid {{a strong}} {{hand on my}} shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Shoving the protesting and {{leave-taking}} Barker with paternal familiarity {{from the}} room, <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and faced Demorest.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he fancied that {{he heard}} a sob. But {{it might have been}} only fancy.|$|E
60|$|Arnold turned reluctantly {{back to his}} own room, where Ruth, was anxiously waiting. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{carefully}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|She had {{followed}} him into the room, and <b>he</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as <b>he</b> asked the question.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{having been}} driven away, <b>he</b> softly <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again, {{and returned to}} the hall-table. He looked into the post-basket.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could hardly}} wait until <b>he</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him, before I asked impatiently, with mingled hope and despair in my tones: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Fosdyke had deceived me. Mr. Sax had {{returned}} in her place. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> We two were alone.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{behind him}} the {{stranger}} {{raised his eyes}} to Solidor, whose sovereign, cloud-like crest swayed among the stars.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after her, and, {{returning}} to his seat, scribbled something {{on a piece of}} paper. Then he rang the bell.|$|E
6000|$|Warwick rose as <b>he</b> spoke, <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and came}} back wearing an {{expression}} which caused her to start up with a gesture of entreaty-- ...|$|R
6000|$|RANSOM: [...] "Yes. But she isn't pensive. She's awfully deep. It {{makes me}} shudder {{to think how}} deep that girl is. And when I think of my courage in daring {{to be in love}} with her--a stupid, {{straightforward}} idiot like me--I begin to respect myself in spite of being such an ass. Well, I'm off. If I stay any longer I shall never go." [...] <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after him, and Miss Reed instantly springs to her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did he mean, Betts?" [...] asked Isaac, {{going back}} to his sister after <b>he</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "Didn't {{you want him to}} help you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{handed her}} into the car. She moved her skirts instinctively {{to make room for}} him by her side. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Turnbull sniffed, {{and took}} a turn {{up and down the}} room; then <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and came toward his friend again.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} him there, and as <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> she answered his questioning look by running {{into his arms}} and hiding her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm! {{he seems}} in a hurry. Perhaps it's a bear this time. Well, mate, how d'ye feel now?" [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{returning}} to his seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is {{left on the}} latch. She says {{he finds}} {{his way up to}} his room, in the dark, and the candle and a tinderbox are always placed handy for him there. We will take our shoes off presently, and, when we hear {{footsteps}} come up to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and stop, we will blow out the candle and steal out into the passage, so as to catch him directly <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I have got handcuffs here, some rope, and a gag." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later Roland entered Margaret's library, where she sat {{awaiting}} him. <b>He</b> carefully <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows. They sat side by side upon the sofa.|$|R
