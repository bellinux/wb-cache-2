6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for the prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for health or salubrity, as {{the breath of}} the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> slowly arriving; it was not an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied. Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shorter, and that {{she ran out of}} time and energy as she tried to finish it.|$|E
5|$|The Pasiphae {{group is}} quite dispersed, with a spread over 1.3Gm, inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43. The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, {{which might be}} the result of {{multiple}} collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|After the windmill, {{wind power}} {{applications}} in other devices and even vehicles {{were found in}} China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the male-line.|$|E

5|$|On 31 December 1888, {{his body}} was found {{floating}} in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was {{in possession of a}} return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a final payment from the school.|$|E
5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> over a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E
5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease may have affected her grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation {{that one of her}} great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man {{assemblies}} were readied, {{and scheduled}} to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay {{to return to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.|$|E

The project was projected to cost $60,000,000 and if the job was done quickly, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done by 1929.
