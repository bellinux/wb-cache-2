5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce their}} chance of detection, {{if the target}} could be {{destroyed}} by demolition charges, set on a <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse</b> so the team can exfiltrate before the explosion, this would be far preferable to having to fight {{their way to the}} target, place demolition charges, and fight {{their way out of the}} now-alerted target area.|$|R

2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows. The fastest blowing fuses are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be very damaging. [...] Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses. [...] The time <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> (also known as anti-surge, or slow-blow) are designed to allow a current which is above the rated value of the fuse to flow {{for a short period}} of time without the fuse blowing. [...] These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{there were}} no special sea target shells, instead, regular {{fragmentation}} shells were used with timed, immediate and <b>delayed</b> <b>fuses</b> for differences in desired effect. A first attempt to develop sea target shells failed in the 1980s, with the company going bankrupt. A fresh start {{was done in the}} beginning of the 1990s for payload shells similar to some anti-tank shells.|$|R
2500|$|An {{assault was}} planned for 8 December, {{with the main}} thrust to be {{provided}} by the 39th Battalion. This was Brigadier Ivan Dougherty's [...] "last throw" [...] at taking Gona. If unsuccessful, Vasey had decided to contain Gona while concentrating on Sanananda. Aerial bombardment mainly fell on the Australian positions by mistake and the attack was postponed until a 250-round artillery bombardment was fired with <b>delay</b> <b>fuses.</b> Honner committed his battalion to attack under the artillery barrage, calculating that his troops would maintain the attack under their own fire and that the barrage would give them an advantage to succeed. The <b>delay</b> <b>fuses</b> were more effective against the Japanese positions {{and less likely to}} inflict casualties in the attacking force, compared with instantaneous fuses. The day closed with the Japanese position reduced to a small enclave that was taken the following day, after which Honner sent Dougherty the message: [...] "Gona's gone!" ...|$|R
50|$|Giambelli first {{proposed}} to use three medium-sized merchantmen, the Oranje, Post and Gulden Leeuw, {{but this was}} refused, only two smaller vessels being made available: the Fortuyn ("Fortune") and Hoop ("Hope") of about seventy tons. The innovative {{part of the project}} consisted in the Hoop employing a fuse consisting of a combined clockwork and flintlock mechanism provided by an Antwerp watchmaker, Bory; the Fortuyn used a <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse</b> mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|On 22 February 1945, Überlingen {{experienced}} {{its only}} bombing raid, possibly {{attracted by the}} presence of the Dachau sub-camp. In this raid, part of Operation Clarion, seven medium-range B - 26 Martin Marauders of the US 320th Air Expeditionary Wing dropped 56 500 pound bombs, 7 of them with <b>delay</b> <b>fuses,</b> on the city's rail yards. The bombers had taken off from the base in eastern France by Epinal and dropped their bombs at about 13:45.|$|R
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military <b>delay</b> <b>fuses</b> and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|R
2500|$|The commandos {{were divided}} into two groups for the attack. One group {{consisting}} of Lance Sergeant O'Brien, Lance Bombardier Chudley and Private Curtis targeted two high-pressure water pipes [...] in diameter, leading {{from the top of the}} mountain into the plant. Reaching their objective, they planted their plastic explosives in a pattern to blow a [...] gap in the pipes. Attaching a 30-minute <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse,</b> they waited to hear the explosives going off in the plant, which was the signal to activate their fuse.|$|R

50|$|The HE shell weighed 3.08 lb {{and used}} the Type 88 {{instantaneous}} or short <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> with a complete round weighing 5.4 lb. It contained 0.2 lb of explosive, consisting of a small block of picric acid and a larger block of TNT.|$|E
50|$|A {{bouncing}} grenade, the VOG-25P, is also available. On impact, a small {{charge in}} {{the nose of the}} grenade is detonated; this raises the grenade 0.5 to 1.5 m in the air, before an impact <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> detonates it. The VOG-25P also has a lethal radius of 6 meters.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} {{started at}} 14:00 on November 9, 1948, with an artillery barrage {{from a number}} of units: two batteries of 75 mm Saint Chamond-Mondragón ("Cucaracha"), two batteries of 75 mm Krupp cannons, a number of 6 pounders and sixteen 120 mm mortars with <b>delayed</b> <b>fuses.</b> The cannons fired directly, in order to force the Egyptians to abandon their defensive posts and go inside the building. Machine gunners from Givati's 51st Battalion also positioned themselves {{to the west of the}} fort to provide cover fire.|$|R
50|$|The idea, {{developed}} in 1941, {{was that when}} the dead rat was discovered in the boiler room of a locomotive, factory, power station, or similar installation, the stoker tending the boiler would dispose of the unpleasant discovery by shoveling it into the furnace, causing the booby trapped rat to explode. A rat could contain {{only a small amount}} of explosive; however, a penetration of a highly pressurized steam boiler could trigger a devastating boiler explosion. A rat bomb could also be set with a <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The commandos {{were divided}} into two groups for the attack. One group {{consisting}} of Lance Sergeant O'Brien, Lance Bombardier Chudley and Private Curtis targeted two high-pressure water pipes 7 ft in diameter, leading {{from the top of the}} mountain into the plant. Reaching their objective, they planted their plastic explosives in a pattern to blow a [...] gap in the pipes. Attaching a 30-minute <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse,</b> they waited to hear the explosives going off in the plant, which was the signal to activate their fuse.|$|R
50|$|The Luftwaffe {{was known}} to have fitted small {{aluminum}} strips which frequently carried explosive self-destruct charges onto {{the outside of the}} equipment's aluminum housings. These explosives were linked then by a <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> attached onto any sensitive apparatus, which allowed it to be destroyed rather than be captured by the Allies.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} World War II German S-mine {{has been}} widely influential. Other countries that have employed bounding mines in war include the United States of America, the Soviet Union, Vietnam and countries of former Yugoslavia. China and Italy have also produced them. Some American mines designed for this purpose used a standard 60 mm HE mortar round with an improvised time <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> which is activated by the propelling charge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{morning after}} their blunder, on March 29, their fishing boat Brattholm [...] - [...] {{containing}} 8 tons of explosives intended {{to destroy the}} air control tower [...] - [...] was attacked by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the 8 tons of explosive using a time <b>delay</b> <b>fuse,</b> and fled in a small boat; however the small boat was promptly sunk by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the explosion, Organisation Todt workers were {{assigned}} {{to clean up the}} debris and wreckage. On 30 March at 16:30 the torpedoes from MTB 74, which were on a <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse</b> setting, exploded at the old entrance into the basin. This raised alarms among the Germans. The Organisation Todt workers ran away from the dock area. German guards, mistaking their khaki uniforms for British uniforms, opened fire, killing some of them. The Germans also thought that some Commandos were still hiding in the town, and made a street by street search, during which some townspeople were also killed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} built in 1897 for Charles Gray, an officer who fought with the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa. By the 1930s the house was owned by Major Arthur Abrahams from whom it was requisitioned by the War Office in 1939. During the Second World War the house was used by MD1 for the {{development}} and testing of various weapons including time <b>delay</b> <b>fuses,</b> depth charges and PIAT guns. The house, which was known locally as [...] "Winston Churchill's Toyshop", accommodated some 250 people at this time. Meanwhile Abrahams was knighted for his services to the British Red Cross in June 1942.|$|R
50|$|Letrozole {{has also}} been shown to <b>delay</b> the <b>fusing</b> of the growth plates in mice. When used in {{combination}} with growth hormone, letrozole has been shown effective in one adolescent boy with a short stature.|$|R
50|$|M48 Point Detonating (PD) Fuze: Selective Powder Train burning fuze {{that can}} be set to Super Quick or Delay {{ignition}} on impact. The factory pre-set delay time was stamped on the shell body. If the Super-Quick flash ignition failed, the <b>Delay</b> <b>fuse</b> kicked in. If set on Delay, the Super Quick flash igniter mechanism was immobilized to prevent premature ignition. Models: M48, M48A1, M48A2 (either 0.05 or 0.15 second Delay), & M48A3 (0.05 second delay).|$|E
50|$|A spolette is a <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> {{consisting}} of a hollow wooden dowel or a paper tube rammed full of black powder. A spolette is glued into {{the wall of a}} fireworks shell and ignited by the lift charge that launches the shell into the air. The spolette, after a delay that allows the shell to reach its top of trajectory, ignites the shell's main effect(s). The tough wood construction ensures that the fuse burns reliably despite the explosive force and acceleration of the launch.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand. The fuze stand held either a pin based tripwire fuze or a combination pressure tripwire fuze with a pronged pressure cap. Later fuzes were sensitive to pressure or pull and could be used with a tripwire. When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of {{the main body of}} the mine and into the air. A pyrotechnic <b>delay</b> <b>fuse</b> triggers the mine when it has risen to between two and three meters in height. The lethal radius of the mine is reported to be approximately ten meters.|$|E
5000|$|The Carp shelter {{would be}} the largest of such {{facilities}} (over 9,300 m2) {{and the only one}} in the immediate Ottawa area. The underground 4-storey bunker required 32,000 tonnes of concrete and 5,000 tonnes of steel. The structure was capable of withstanding a nuclear blast up to 5 megatons from 1.8 km away. It had massive blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters to prevent radiation infiltration. Although supposedly effective against surface nuclear detonations, the facility was later found to be vulnerable to conventional Bunker buster bombs developed after its construction, as these bombs had time <b>delay</b> <b>fuses</b> that would detonate after they had penetrated deeply enough underground.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack was}} to be made at very low level, with bombs being dropped at a height of 10 feet off the ground. The {{aircraft}} had to slow to just above their loaded stall speed {{at the time of}} bomb release so the bombs would not be destroyed by their impact with the ground. This was a significant risk in itself, as stalling while at such low altitude allowed no possibility for recovery. After bomb release the planes then had to pull up to clear the 20 foot high walls of the prison. Time <b>delay</b> <b>fuses,</b> with an 11 second delay, were used to allow the aircraft time to clear the target before their bombs exploded.|$|R
5000|$|The task of {{destroying}} Japanese bunkers {{was found to}} be [...] "beyond the scope of 25 prs". Brigadier General Waldron, the 32nd Division's artillery commander {{at the start of the}} battle, was more forthright. [...] "The 25 pounders", he said, [...] "annoyed the Japanese, and that's about all." [...] The gun's flat trajectory and small explosive shell was not suited to destroying emplacements, but rather for fire support against exposed targets. The high trajectory of the mountain howitzers was better suited to this task but, while a larger calibre, they fired a smaller 20 pound shell. The 3.7 in howitzer was considered accurate and capable of a high rate of fire; however, these particular guns were well worn, and accuracy was compromised as a consequence. Shells used by artillery were armed with instantaneous fuses, causing them to explode on impact. Hits achieved by the artillery were comparatively ineffective. With adequate observation, between 100 and 200 shells fired by four guns were needed to reduce a large emplacement. A <b>delayed</b> <b>fuse,</b> to postpone the explosion until the projectile had buried itself deep in the target, would have been much more effective. None were initially available, and when they were, their supply was limited. The Japanese defenders referred to delayed-fuse shells fired from the American 105 mm howitzer as [...] "earthquake bombs". The Japanese defensive positions remained substantially proof against shell fire. The use of <b>delayed</b> <b>fuses</b> at Gona on 8 December was critical to the success of the 39th Battalion, when attacking troops spent two full minutes under their own artillery bombardment as they stormed Japanese positions.|$|R
