The multiplex is {{owned and operated}} by the BBC and <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a number of transmitter sites across the country. The BBC's national multiplex carries only BBC national radio stations. Local BBC radio stations are carried on the relevant local DAB ensemble where commercial DAB licences are operating.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} future, in the year 2039, where humans have begun deep space exploration. A {{distress}} call <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a crippled ship near an alien planet. The game's protagonist, a special soldier, responds to the call. Upon boarding the ship, the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens. The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose. The story has sections that take place aboard the space craft and on the planet's surface. The protagonist's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible, eliminate the alien threat, and escape the space craft.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> {{one person to}} another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of transmitting {{movement from the}} implant to the prosthesis determines the degree of prosthetic motility. Movement <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> traditional nonporous spherical implants through the surface tension at the conjunctival–prosthetic interface and movement of the fornices. Quasi-integrated implants have irregularly shaped surfaces that create an indirect coupling mechanism between the implant and prosthesis that imparts greater movement to the prosthesis. Directly integrating the implant to the prosthesis through an externalized coupling mechanism {{would be expected to}} improve motility further.|$|E
25|$|Vajrayana {{teaches that}} the two stages of the {{practice}} of Vajrayoginī (generation stage and completion stage) were originally taught by Vajradhara. He manifested in the form of Heruka to expound the Root Tantra of Chakrasaṃvara, and it was in this tantra that he explained the practice of Vajrayoginī. All the many lineages of instructions on Vajrayoginī {{can be traced back to}} this original revelation. Of these lineages, there are three that are most commonly practiced: the Narokhachö lineage, which <b>was</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> Vajrayoginī to Naropa; the Maitrikhachö lineage, which <b>was</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> Vajrayoginī to Maitripa; and the Indrakhachö lineage, which <b>was</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> Vajrayoginī to Indrabodhi.|$|R

These chants are unusual inasmuch as they <b>were</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which <b>were</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to boyfriends or marriage.|$|R
25|$|C. difficile <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> {{person to}} person by the fecal-oral route. The {{organism}} forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them {{to pass through the}} stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon.|$|E
25|$|Infrasound {{wavelengths}} can {{be generated}} artificially through detonations and other human activity, or naturally from earthquakes, severe weather, lightning, and other sources. Like forensic seismology, algorithms and other filter techniques are required to analyze gathered data and characterize events {{to determine if a}} nuclear detonation has actually occurred. Data <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> each station via secure communication links for further analysis. A digital signature is also embedded in the data sent from each station to verify if the data is authentic.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{influenza}} <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> infected mammals {{through the}} air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. Out of a host, flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at , and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast Siberia). They can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents.|$|E

25|$|The first crucial step in {{understanding}} {{the life cycle of}} the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides was demonstrated by Grassi in a grotesque self-experimentation. To solve a century-old puzzle of how infection of roundworm <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> one host to another, he ingested the roundworm eggs on 30 August 1879. He had obtained the eggs from a human corpse, which was heavily infected, upon autopsy on 10 October 1878. After twenty-two days, he found fresh eggs in his faeces. Thus proving that the roundworm is transmitted through direct ingestion from contaminated source.|$|E
25|$|Companies such as eSonar, Raymarine UK, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make {{a variety}} of sonar and {{acoustic}} instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped {{with one or more}} acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a different transmit antenna {{in the same}} frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes a gene, {{after being}} turned on, transcribes {{a product that}} (directly or indirectly) {{maintains}} the activity of that gene. For example, Hnf4 and MyoD enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the transcription factor activity of the proteins they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development. Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different splice forms of RNA, or by formation of double-stranded RNA (RNAi). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are often turned on or off by signal transduction, although in some systems where syncytia or gap junctions are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by diffusion. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the zygote by the mother during oogenesis or via nurse cells, resulting in maternal effect phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.|$|E
