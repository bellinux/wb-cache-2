Cone-beam CT functionality is also an increasingly common function found in medical fluoroscopy equipment; by rotating the fluoroscope around the patient, a geometry similar to CT can be obtained, and by treating the 2D X-ray detector {{in a manner similar}} to a CT detector with a massive number of rows, it is possible to reconstruct a 3D volume from a single rotation using suitable software.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An image overlay {{system is}} {{presented}} to assist needle placement <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>CT</b> scanners. The device consists of a flat LCD display and a half mirror and is mounted on the gantry. Looking at the patient through the mirror, the CT image appears to be floating inside the patient with correct size and position, thereby providing the physician with two-dimensional “X-ray vision ” to guide needle placement procedures. The physician inserts the needle following the optimal path identified in the CT image that is rendered on the LCD and thereby reflected in the mirror. The system promises to increase needle placement accuracy and also to reduce X-ray dose, patient discomfort, and procedure time by eliminating faulty insertion attempts. We report cadaver experiments in several clinical applications with a clinically applicable device. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCone-beam CT {{has been}} {{integrated}} with the linear accelerator for image-guided radiotherapy, i. e., the accurate assessment and correction of the target position prior to treatment delivery. The slowness of these cone-beam CT scanners, which rotate at less than 1 rpm, induces respiratory motion artifacts if the patient can breath freely during the acquisition. As <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>CT,</b> several techniques have been proposed to correct for these artifacts. Respiration-correlated cone-beam CT assumes that respiratory motion is periodic to sort the cone-beam projection images in subsets according to a respiratory signal, and reconstructs from each subset the corresponding phase of the respiratory cycle, resulting in a 4 D cone-beam CT image. A more advanced solution is motion-compensated cone-beam CT which necessitates {{an estimate of the}} respiratory motion during the cone-beam acquisition to compensate for the respiratory motion during the reconstruction from all the cone-beam projection images. This chapter is an overview of these recent developments for correction of respiratory motion in cone-beam CT for image-guided radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Coherent-scatter {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{is a technique}} that produces images based on low-angle X-ray coherent scatter. The number of coherent-scatter photons corresponding to the scattered angles is sensitive to the molecular structure, and hence, their contrast properties on CT images {{are expected to be}} higher at specific angles. However, very few studies have reported such image contrasts. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate and compare the contrast properties of coherent-scatter CT images with those of conventional CT images. First, simulation studies using coherent-scatter distributions were performed with monoenergetic beams of 30, 60, and 90 keV, and a polyenergetic beam of 40 kV. This was followed by an experimental study using coherent-scatter CT images with a plastic phantom measuring 6 cm in diameter radiated by a polyenergetic beam of 40 kV. The relative contrast in coherent-scatter CT images at a low-scatter angle was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>CT</b> images. This result suggests that coherent-scatter CT is useful in the detection of low-contrast lesions...|$|E
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} weed infestation of pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivated {{under conditions}} of <b>conventional</b> (<b>CT),</b> reduced (RT) and herbicide tillage (HT).

40|$|Model-based {{iterative}} reconstruction (MBIR) {{has been}} increasingly broadly applied as {{an improvement over}} traditional, analytical image reconstruction methods in X-ray CT, primarily due to its significant advantage in drastic dose reduction without diagnostic loss.

In this dissertation, we developed an MBIR algorithm for dual-energy CT that included a joint data-likelihood model to account for correlated data noise. Moreover, we developed a Gaussian-Mixture Markov random filed (GM-MRF) image model that can be used as a very expressive prior model in MBIR for X-ray CT reconstruction. The GM-MRF model is formed by merging individual patch-based Gaussian-mixture models and therefore leads to an expressive MRF model with easily estimated parameters. Experimental results with phantom and clinical datasets have demonstrated the improvement in image quality due to the advanced statistical modeling. ...|$|E

We briefly discuss {{the state of}} the art <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> absorption-based <b>CT</b> and make a link to a new imaging technique: phase-contrast CT. This technique can be implemented at third generation synchrotron radiation sources or by using a microfocus x-ray tube. Unlike conventional absorption-based imaging, phase-contrast imaging uses the phase shifts in the x-ray beam rather than the differences in attenuation. Promising experimental results have been obtained by several research groups.

We suggest such a theory and prove a fundamental theorem that plays the same role for phase-contrast CT as the Fourier slice theorem does for absorption-based CT.

In contrast to other methods, the suggested approach requires no intermediate steps of phase retrieval and provides exact quantitative reconstruction of the refractive index from intensity measurements.

40|$|Introduction Pedicle screw placement, through {{relevant}} biomechanical properties, is {{a widely}} used procedure {{for the treatment of}} spine pathologies including trauma, scoliotic deformities, infection, degenerative and malignant diseases [1]. Inaccurate screw placement with a pedicle breach can lead to spinal cord, visceral and vascular injuries, with complications in terms of patient survival [2]. This retrospective study aims to assess accuracy of pedicle screw placement using a new intra-operative cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technique, and to compare the efficacy of this technique with <b>conventional</b> postoperative <b>CT</b> scans for pedicle breach detection. Methods In 102 patients, 586 pedicle screws were inserted over a 21 month period. In all patients, intraoperative CBCT scans (Fig. 1) were acquired after all screws were inserted, and retrospectively reviewed by orthopaedic surgeons for pedicle breach detection and grading. Of the 586 inserted screws, placement assessment of 239 screws were also carried out <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> postoperative <b>CT</b> scans using the same grading system. Reliability tests computing Cohen’s Kappa coefficient and Gwet’s coefficient were performed to compare the CBCT imaging technique with the <b>conventional</b> postoperative <b>CT</b> scans for assessing screw placement accuracy and detecting pedicle breach. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the CBCT imaging technique to assess screw placement accuracy were measured, assuming that postoperative CT scanning is the gold standard for assessing such accuracy. Figure 1 : Illustrations of the CBCT imaging system (Artis Zeego, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany). Results Of the 586 inserted pedicle screws (Fig. 2), 496 (84. 6 %) were placed within the pedicle without any breach, 24 (4. 1 %) were in-out-in screws with a lateral breach but with the screw tip inside the vertebral body, 21 (3. 6 %) had a medial breach 4 mm, 5 (0. 9 %) had a lateral breach, and 26 (4. 4 %) had an anterior breach. Seventeen screws (2. 9 %) were revised intraoperatively. Kappa and Gwet’s coefficients on screw placement assessment carried out in intraoperative CBCT and <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> postoperative <b>CT</b> scans were 0. 80 and 0. 93, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the intraoperative CBCT imaging technique, considering that the postoperative CT imaging is the gold standard, were 0. 77 and 0. 98, respectively.

As an important supplement, three-dimensional CT virtual intravascular endoscopy (VIE) can show relevant details.

Among 127 consecutive symptomatic patients with suspected AD who underwent CT angiography (CTA), 84 subjects were confirmed to have AD and were included <b>in</b> the study. <b>Conventional</b> <b>CT</b> and VIE images were observed and evaluated. From the 92 entry tears revealed via <b>conventional</b> <b>CT,</b> 88 (95. 7 %) tears appeared on VIE with round (n = 26), slit-shaped (n = 9), or irregular (n = 53) shapes, whereas the intimal flaps were sheetlike (n = 34), tubular (n = 34), wavelike (n = 13), or irregular (n = 7) in shape. The VIE also showed the spatial relationship between the torn flap and adjacent structures. Among 58 entry tears with multiple-line type flap shown on <b>conventional</b> <b>CT,</b> 41 (70. 7 %) appeared with an irregular shape on VIE, whereas among 30 tears with single-line type flap, 17 (56. 7 %) appeared as round or slit-shaped on VIE.

40|$|The mastoid, {{located in}} the {{temporal}} bone, houses an air cell system whose cells have a variation in size that can go far below current <b>conventional</b> clinical <b>CT</b> scanner resolution. Therefore, the mastoid air cell system is only partially represented in a CT scan. Where the <b>conventional</b> clinical <b>CT</b> scanner lacks level of minute details, micro-CT scanning provides an overwhelming amount of ne details. The temporal bone {{being one of the}} most complex in the human body, visualization of micro-CT scanning of this boneawakens the curiosity of the experimenter, especially with the correct visualization settings. This thesis first presents a statistical analysis determining the surface area to volume ratio of the mastoid air cell system of human temporal bone, from micro-CT scanning using methods previously applied for <b>conventional</b> clinical <b>CT</b> scans. The study compared current results with previous studies, with successive downsampling the data down to a resolution found <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> clinical <b>CT</b> scanning. The results from the statistical analysis showed that all the small mastoid air cells, that cannot be detected <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> clinical <b>CT</b> scans, do heavily contribute to the estimation of the surface area, and in consequence to the estimation of the surface area to volume ratio by a factor of about 2. 6. Such a result further strengthens the idea of the mastoid to play an active role in pressure regulation and gas exchange. Discovery of micro-channels through specific use of a non-traditional transfer function was then reported, where a qualitative and a quantitative pre-analysis were performed and reported. To gain more knowledge about these micro-channels, a local structure tensor analysis was applied where structures are described in terms of planar, tubular, or isotropic structures. The results from this structural tensor analysis suggest these microchannels to potentially be part of a more complex framework, which hypothetically would provide a separate blood supply for the mucosa lining the mastoid air cell system. The knowledge gained from analysing the micro-channels as locally providing blood to the mucosa, led to the consideration of how inflammation of the mucosa could impact the pneumatization of the mastoid air cell system. Though very primitive, a 3 D shape analysis of the mastoid air cell system was carried out. The mastoid air cell system was first represented in a compact form through a medial axis, from which medial balls could be used. The medial balls, representative of how large the mastoid air cells can be locally, were used in two complementary clustering methods, one based on the size diameter of the medial balls and one based on their location within the mastoid air cell system. From both quantitative and qualitative statistics, it was possible to map the clusters based on pre-defined regions already described in the literature, which opened the door for new hypotheses concerning the effect of mucosal inflammation on the mastoid pneumatization. Last but not least, discovery of other structures, previously unreported in the literature, were also visually observed and briefly discussed in this thesis. Further analysis of these unknown structures is needed...|$|R

Patients and Methods Ten HCC patients after treated with TACE underwent Discovery CT 750 HD and MRI 750 3 T examination. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of iodine-based material decomposition images, monochromatic images and conventional CT images were generated. Results Consequently, 30 residual lesions were detected in MRI of 10 patients. They were found in iodine-based images and monochromatic images versus 29 <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>CT</b> images. The area under ROC curves for the lesion-to-normal parenchyma ratio (LNR) on arterial phase (AP) in iodine-based material decomposition images, monochromatic images and conventional CT images were 0. 933, 0. 833 and 0. 817, respectively. Conclusion The study data highlighted good value of iodine-based material decomposition images of spectral CT in assessment of both lipiodol deposition and residual cancer for follow-up of HCC patients previously treated with TACE...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of applied tillage systems on changes of chosen parameters of soil microbiological activity. Analyses of microbiological properties of soil were performed on soil samples collected from long-term field experiments at a private farm in RogÃƒÂ³w (Lublin voivodeship) on silt-loam soil and at the IUNG-PIB Experimental Station in GrabÃƒÂ³w (Masovian voivodeship) on heavy loamy sand. Winter wheat was grown <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> (<b>CT)</b> and reduced tillage (RT) systems. Analyses of soil taken from experimental fields included the rate of CO 2 evolution using the titration method; microbial biomass C content using the F-I method; dehydrogenase system activity using TTC as a substrate; microbial biomass N content using the F-E method and the Most Probable Number (MPN) of ammonia- and nitrate-forming bacteria. Applied tillage systems affected significantly the analysed parameters of biological activity of tested soils in both experimental years. In general, at both experimental sites, the numbers of specific groups of soil microorganisms estimated on the quantity of biomass C and N were significantly higher in RT soil than in CT soil (by about 20 %, on average) at both depths: 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm. In 2006 and 2007, the dehydrogenase activity, ammonification and nitrification strength of soil reached the highest values mostly in RT soil at both experimental sites. Calculated higher values of microbial quotient and lower values of metabolic quotient in RT soil indicate that the RT system created a more friendly environment for the growth and activity of soil microorganisms, in comparison with the CT system...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} ultrasonically-assisted turning (UAT) is a {{superposition}} of vibration of {{a cutting tool}} on its standard movement <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> turning (<b>CT).</b> The former technique has several advantages compared with the latter, {{one of the main}} being a significant decrease in the level of cutting forces. In this paper the effects observed in UAT are analysed employing ideas of dynamic fracture mechanics. The active stage of loading duration depends heavily on ultrasonic frequency and the cutting speed; he application of the fracture criterion based on the notion of incubation time makes it possible to calculate a dependence of this duration on its threshold amplitude. An estimation of energy, necessary to create a threshold pulse in the material, is made by solving the contact Hertz problem. The obtained time dependence of energy has a marked minimum. Thus, the existence of energy-efficient loading duration is demonstrated. This explains the decrease in the cutting force resulting from superimposed ultrasonic vibration. The obtained results are in agreement with experiments on ultrasonic assisted machining of aluminium and Inconel 718 alloy...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{accuracy}} in oncological computed tomography (CT) {{could lead to}} a decrease in morbidity and improved survival for oncology patients. Visualization of metabolic activity using the glucose analogue [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in combination with the high anatomic resolution of CT in an integrated positron emission tomography (PET) /CT examination has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of primary and metastatic lesions. However, PET/CT costs are high and patient access is limited; thus CT remains the primary imaging modality in oncology patients. We have noted that subtle lesions are more easily detected on CT by radiologists with PET/CT experience. We aimed to provide a brief review of the literature with comparisons of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and PET/CT in primary and metastatic disease with an emphasis on findings that may be overlooked on MDCT in cancer of the breast, lung, colon, and ovaries, and in melanoma, as well as thrombosis in oncology patients. We further reviewed our experience for illustrative comparisons of PET/CT and MDCT studies. Experience <b>in</b> interpreting <b>conventional</b> <b>CT</b> scans alongside PET/CT can help the reader develop an appreciation for the subtle appearance of some lesions on CT that might otherwise be missed. This could improve detection rates, reduce errors, and improve patient management...|$|R
40|$|In the {{development}} of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in medical imaging, one is working to implement spectral information. While keeping the dose level the same, or even lower, than <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> systems, spectral <b>CT</b> offers the possibility to measure energy dependent features of different tissues {{that will allow the}} extraction of additional information about the patient, eventu-ally leading to real color CT. Spectral CT can be achieved through the application of energy sensitive pixel detectors, such as Medipix-based semiconductor devices and by the implementation of reconstruction algorithms where the energy information is taken into account. In this paper, we present the latest results of our work on spectral CT with Medipix detectors and specifically on detector characterization and {{the development}} of algorithms that include energy information...|$|R
