40|$|A novel dual-optic micro X-ray {{fluorescence}} {{instrument will}} be developed to do radiochemical analysis of high-level radioactive wastes at DOE sites such as Savannah River Site and Hanford. This concept incorporates new X-ray optical elements such as monolithic polycapillaries and <b>double</b> <b>bent</b> crystals, which focus X-rays. The polycapillary optic {{can be used to}} focus X-rays emitted by the X-ray tube thereby increasing the X-ray flux on the sample over 1000 times. Polycapillaries will also be used to collect the X-rays from the excitation site and screen the radiation background from the radioactive species in the specimen. This dual-optic approach significantly reduces the background and increases the analyte signal thereby increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. A doubly bent crystal used as the focusing optic produces focused monochromatic X-ray excitation, which eliminates the bremsstrahlung background from the X-ray source. The coupling of the doubly bent crystal for monochromatic excitation with a polycapillary for signal collection can effectively eliminate the noise background and radiation background from the specimen. The integration of these X-ray optics increases the signal-to-noise and thereby increases the sensitivity of the analysis for low-level analytes. This work will address a key need for radiochemical analysis of high-level waste using a non-destructive, multi-element, and rapid method in a radiation environment.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{experiments}} carried {{out over a}} wide range of Reynolds numbers (2 ∙ 104 < Re < 2 ∙ 106) in the high pressure windtunnel in Göttingen. The model was a rectangular cylinder with aspect ratio 1 : 5. It has a sharp-edged generic cross section, which was selected as benchmark problem for bluff bodies in general (www. aniv-iawe. org/barc/BARC). High Reynolds numbers were reached by increasing the pressure in the flow medium up to 70 bar. Steady and unsteady forces were measured with a piezoelectric balance whose major characteristic is its stiffness, which makes the instrument particularly useful for investigating unsteady phenomena. Thus apart from steady i. e. time averaged values including the base pressure coefficient, also power spectra and probability density functions were measured yielding for example Strouhal numbers, higher statistical moments etc. Considering the dependence of the lift coefficient upon the Reynolds number, in particular for α = 4 ° a significant Reynolds number effect is obvious in the curve, which is <b>double</b> <b>bent</b> and the values are ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 6. In addition, the trend to lower or to higher Reynolds numbers indicates a further decrease and increase of the lift coefficient, respectively. Also for α = 6 ° and α = 2 ° there is a significant increase of the lift in the range Re < 105, at which the rise is shifted to lower for α = 6 ° and to higher Reynolds numbers in case of 2 °. Probably the shape of separation bubbles, that depends on the Reynolds number is responsible for these effects, which are stronger in asymmetric flow (α ≠ 0 °) than in the symmetric case(α = 0 °), where the effects on the upper and the lower side can compensate each other. Concerning vortex resonance phenomenon, a response diagram was taken for the natural bending motion of the rather slender model, which was fixed at both sides in the stiff balance. Finally, as a supplement the section was also investigated with the bluff i. e. much longer side normal to the flow, a case which {{can be seen as a}} test case for the absence of Reynolds number effects. ...|$|E
40|$|Techniques {{that can}} {{increase}} the SI- engine efficiency while keeping the emissions very low {{is to reduce the}} engine displacement volume combined with a charging system. Advanced systems are needed for an effective boosting of the engine and today 1 D engine simulation tools are often used for their optimization. This thesis concerns 1 D engine simulation of a turbocharged SI engine and the introduction of CFD computations on components as a way to assess inaccuracies in the 1 D model. 1 D engine simulations have been performed on a turbocharged SI engine and the results have been validated by on-engine measurements in test cell. The operating points considered have been in the engine’s low speed and load region, with the turbocharger’s waste-gate closed. The instantaneous on-engine turbine efficiency was calculated for two different turbochargers based on high frequency measurements in test cell. Unfortunately the instantaneous mass flow rates and temperatures directly upstream and downstream of the turbine could not be measured and simulated values from the calibrated engine model were used. The on-engine turbine efficiency was compared with the efficiency computed by the 1 D code using steady flow data to describe the turbine performance. The results show that the on-engine turbine efficiency shows a hysteretic effect over the exhaust pulse so that the discrepancy between measured and quasi-steady values increases for decreasing mass flow rate after a pulse peak. Flow modeling in pipe geometries that can be representative to those of an exhaust manifold, single bent pipes and <b>double</b> <b>bent</b> pipes and also the outer runners of an exhaust manifold, have been computed in both 1 D and 3 D under steady and pulsating flow conditions. The results have been compared in terms of pressure losses. The results show that calculated pressure gradient for a straight pipe under steady flow is similar using either 1 D or 3 D computations. The calculated pressure drop over a bend is clearly higher 1 D engine simulations of turbocharged engines are difficult to using 1 D computations compared to 3 D computations, both for steady and pulsating flow. Also, the slow decay of the secondary flow structure that develops over a bend, gives a higher pressure gradient in the 3 D calculations compared to the 1 D calculation in the straight pipe parts downstream of a bend.

40|$|Non-pulsatile and {{pulsatile flow}} in bent pipes and radial turbine has been {{assessed}} with numerical simulations. The flow field {{in a single}} bent pipe has been computed with different turbulence modelling approaches. A comparison with measured data shows that Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) gives the best agreement in terms of mean flow quantities. All computations with the different turbulence models qualitatively capture the so called Dean vortices. The Dean vortices are a pair of counter-rotating vortices that are created in the bend, due to inertial effects in combination with a radial pressure gradient. The pulsatile flow in a <b>double</b> <b>bent</b> pipe has also been considered. In the first bend, the Dean vortices are formed {{and in the second}} bend a swirling motion is created, which will together with the Dean vortices create a complex flow field downstream of the second bend. The strength of these structures will vary with the amplitude of the axial flow. For pulsatile flow, a phase shift between the velocity and the pressure occurs and the phase shift is not constant during the pulse depending on the balance between the different terms in the Navier- Stokes equations. The performance of a radial turbocharger turbine working under both non-pulsatile and pulsatile flow conditions has also been investigated by using ILES. To assess the effect of pulsatile inflow conditions on the turbine performance, three different cases have been considered with different frequencies and amplitude of the mass flow pulse and different rotational speeds of the turbine wheel. The results show that the turbine cannot be treated as being quasi-stationary; for example, the shaft power varies with varying frequency of the pulses for the same amplitude of mass flow. The pulsatile flow also implies that the incidence angle of the flow into the turbine wheel varies during the pulse. For the worst case, the relative incidence angle varies from approximately − 80 ° to + 60 °. A phase shift between the pressure and the mass flow at the inlet and the shaft torque also occurs. This phase shift increases with increasing frequency, which affects the accuracy of the results from 1 -D models based on turbine maps measured under non-pulsatile conditions. For a turbocharger working under internal combustion engine conditions, the flow into the turbine is pulsatile and there are also unsteady secondary flow components, depending on the geometry of the exhaust manifold situated upstream of the turbine. Therefore, the effects of different perturbations at the inflow conditions on the turbine performance have been assessed. For the different cases both turbulent fluctuations and different secondary flow structures are added to the inlet velocity. The results show that a non-disturbed inlet flow gives the best performance, while an inflow condition with a certain large scale eddy in combination with turbulence has the largest negative effect on the shaft power output.

40|$|The finite {{response}} {{time of the}} turbocharger is the most notable effect of transient operation on a turbocharged diesel engine. To fulfill future emission requirements, high amounts of transient EGR will be required even though after-treatment devices are being used. This implies that advanced turbocharger systems have to be introduced to enable high boost pressure with improved or at least maintained {{response time}}. The increased amount of tuneable parameters from the more advanced turbocharging system will make it difficult and expensive to optimise the engine experimentally. Therefore, the wish is to optimise the engine design using numerical tools. This requires predictive models for the gas exchange system and its components, i. e. the turbocharger, the manifolds and the cylinder with its valves. The results have shown that engine simulation tools based on tabulated data from measurements can qualitatively predict the engine's performance and {{be used as a}} first step in engine design. However, these models have to be calibrated extensively in order to reflect the engine performance quantitatively. The objective of this research is therefore to find a modelling approach for the gas exchange system and its components that are more predictive than the tools used, but still computationally effective enough to be suited for engine simulations. The thesis contains a summary of on-engine experimental results as well as some One-Dimensional (1 D) simulations. Since the 1 D modelling approach has limited range of validity and applicability, we have considered two approaches for reducing the full Three-Dimensional (3 D) governing equations, which are a set of Partial Differential Equations (PDE), in a systematic manner. The first approach is based on a numerical length scale analysis of the different terms in the governing equations after changing the coordinate system with one coordinate aligned with the flow path. By retaining the most important terms or neglecting the (significantly) smallest terms, different reductions may be attained, which in their simplest form may look like the boundary layer equations. The results for a <b>double</b> <b>bent</b> pipe, used to illustrate the approach, show that the most significant component of the viscous terms is the radial component, which is in the order of two magnitudes larger than the axial and azimuthal components. The convective terms are all in the same order of magnitude, whereas the radial component is of significant importance in the bends of the pipe due to centrifugal forces, and the azimuthal component after the second bend due to a swirling motion. For the flow in a straight pipe, the approach would give the same model as the common 1 D simulation tool. However, for pipes with a more general shape, the approach is superior as it allows for a rational reduction of the governing equations. The main limitation of the approach is for flow situations that do not have a dominating flow direction. Under such conditions the a priori and/or the a posteriori analysis would reveal that the reduction is inconsistent. Thus, the approach implies maintained efficiency, but with improved (and assessable) accuracy as compared to the common 1 D simulation tool. The second approach is based on the Galerkin projection of the governing equations projected onto Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes. These POD modes are computed for the flow in a given geometry obtained through Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The Galerkin projection results in a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for the time-dependent coefficients of the 3 D POD modes. The results show that the method is best suited for flows with strong coherent structures. However, the system of ODEs may be inherently unstable (depending on the number of modes used in the simulation) and modelling errors grow with each time-step. This limitation may be remedied by numerically preventing any exponential growth. The approach can also be extended into a combined Galerkin (ODE) - LES (PDE) approach by replacing several steps of the LES by {{the same amount of time}} steps with the reduced model. It should be pointed out that this approach can provide the full 3 D flow field in contrast to space reduced models (e. g. the common 1 D tool) and thereby handle more complex flows with high degree of computational efficiency.  To summarize, the thesis demonstrates new possibilities of obtaining reduced models suited for engine simulations based on 3 D CFD. With this application in mind, these tools are novel and their evaluation and assessment should be extended to other components of the gas exchange system. QC 2011092...|$|E
