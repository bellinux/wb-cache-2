5000|$|A <b>J-turn</b> is {{a driving}} {{maneuver}} {{in which a}} reversing vehicle is spun 180 degrees and continues, facing forward, without changing direction of travel.

A <b>J-turn</b> differs from a bootleg turn in that the vehicle begins in reverse gear. It is often performed by stunt drivers in film and television shows. It can be performed both on dry and snowy surfaces; the latter is preferable while learning the skill.

40|$|Complex motor {{behaviors}} {{are thought to}} be coordinated by networks of brain nuclei that may control different elementary motor programs. Transparent zebrafish larvae offer the opportunity to analyze the functional organization of motor control networks by optical manipulations of neuronal activity during behavior. We examined motor behavior in transgenic larvae expressing channelrhodopsin- 2 throughout many neurons in the brain. Wide-field optical stimulation triggered backward and rotating movements caused by the repeated execution of <b>J-turns,</b> a specific motor program that normally occurs during prey capture. Although optically evoked activity was widespread, behavioral responses were highly coordinated and lateralized. 3 -D mapping of behavioral responses to local optical stimuli revealed that <b>J-turns</b> can be triggered specifically in the anterior-ventral optic tectum and/or the adjacent pretectum. These results suggest that the execution of <b>J-turns</b> is controlled by a small group of neurons in the midbrain that may act as a command center. The identification of a brain area controlling a defined motor program involved in prey capture is a step towards a comprehensive analysis of neuronal circuits mediating sensorimotor behaviors of zebrafish...|$|R

In the second leg, the contestants must drive forward and do a forward handbrake <b>J-turn</b> before tackling a short reverse, before ending the challenge attempting to balance on the gimbal. Mike fails each key portion, {{becoming more and more}} frustrated in each part. After the challenge, Mike admits that his only saving grace is if someone else does worse. Indeed, Angelina's run is worse, as she causes the first leg car to overheat partway through the precision reverse, and destroys the whole reverse portion while out of control in the forward handbrake <b>J-turn</b> causing Andrew to wonder if she should be driving at all.

40|$|Larval {{zebrafish}} innately {{perform a}} suite of behaviors that are tightly linked to their evolutionary past, notably escape from threatening stimuli and pursuit and capture of prey. These behaviors have been carefully examined in the past, but mostly {{with regard to the}} movements of the trunk and tail of the larvae. Here, we employ kinematics analyses to describe the movements of the pectoral fins during escape and predatory behavior. In accord with previous studies, we find roles for the pectoral fins in slow swimming and immediately after striking prey. We find novel roles for the pectoral fins in long-latency, but not in short-latency C-bends. We also observe fin movements that occur during orienting <b>J-turns</b> and S-starts that drive high-velocity predatory strikes. Finally, we find that the use of pectoral fins following a predatory strike is scaled to the velocity of the strike, supporting a role for the fins in braking. The implications of these results for central control of coordinated movements are discussed, and we hope that these results will provide baselines for future analyses of crossbody coordination using mutants, morphants, and transgenic approaches...|$|R

50|$|Mustang Challenge: The Mega-Challenge: This year's Mega-Challenge {{is a full}} {{kilometre}} in length, and as in most {{previous years}} consists of elements from many of this year's challenges. It begins with the drivers {{having to go through}} five Eye of the Needle arches, then having to swerve and avoid a foam pedestrian, before having to drive forwards and then backwards through a lengthy course of wheel rims. The drivers then have to do a reverse flick, and then end the run with a handbrake <b>J-turn.</b> Flora gets the first run, and hits every single arch in the Eye of the Needle section before mowing down the foam pedestrian. She then has a bad run through the wheel rim track in both directions, takes her reverse flick much too early and crashes through the outer wall of that part of the course, and then fails to turn at all in the final <b>J-turn,</b> crashing through both the foam Flora that serves as an obstacle, and the outer wall. Diane goes next, and drives far too quickly to begin with, hitting most of the arches on the opening run, though she at least avoids the foam pedestrian. After a comparatively decent run through the wheel rim segment, she then takes her reverse spin-out, but execute it a little too late and clips the far wall. On the final <b>J-turn</b> segment, Diane clips the foam Diane, skids and then goes even further off the course than Flora did. Diane is tearful after this run and proclaims herself Canada's Worst Driver; Andrew admits that he thought she'd do better, but still considers her far from the worst. Kevin also drives far too fast on the first straight; he somehow avoids hitting the first three arches, but completely smashes the last two. This is followed by an abysmal run through the wheel rim section, in which he manages to wedge himself on the rims during the reverse part, requiring Andrew to step in and free the car. On the reverse spin-out, Kevin takes too long to start turning the wheel and doesn't turn it far enough when he does, crashing off-course. When doing the final <b>J-turn,</b> Kevin completely forgets how to do the manoeuvre and hits the footbrake instead of applying the handbrake, losing control and going off the course yet again. Kevin's run is judged to be the worst by Andrew, as he hit more obstacles than Diane and Flora combined.|$|E
40|$|Vehicles with {{variable}} steering characteristics {{have long}} been studied and compared with those having typical fixed gear ratio steering, and the variable gear ratio properties are reported to have improved maneuverability and stability in high-speed lane changes and on slippery low-friction road surfaces. However, {{it is not clear}} how gear ratios should be set for individual vehicle charac-teristics. Therefore, the present study has investigated a variable steering gear system using body slip angle feedback for the purpose of improved maneuverability and stability in the critical cor-nering range and upwards, in excess of the critical limit, and into the countersteer range. The re-sults of a driving simulator experiment show that the steering effect improves and maneuverabil-ity and stability increase in the critical cornering range and upwards, in excess of the critical limit, and into the countersteer range by applying linear-variable control to the steering ratio from a body slip angle of 5 ˚. This result is seen both in double lane changes, such as in hazard avoidance, and in <b>J-turns</b> with long drifting. Moreover, it shows an improvement in drift controllability through prompt countersteering. Overall, the present system can enhance the driver’s hazard avoidance capability...|$|R
40|$|For {{passenger}} cars, individual tyre model parameters, used in vehicle models able {{to simulate}} vehicle handling behavior, are traditionally derived from expensive component indoor laboratory tests {{as a result}} of an identification procedure minimizing the error with respect to force and slip measurements. Indoor experiments on agricultural tyres are instead more challenging and thus generally not performed due to tyre size and applied forces. However, the knowledge of their handling characteristics is becoming more and more important since in the next few years, all agricultural vehicles are expected to run on ordinary asphalt roads at a speed of 80 km/h. The present paper presents a methodology to identify agricultural tyres' handling characteristics based only on the measurements carried out on board vehicle (vehicle sideslip angle, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, speed and steer angle) during standard handling maneuvers (step-steers, <b>J-turns,</b> etc.), instead than during indoor tests. In particular, MF-Tyre model parameters (including vertical load and pressure dependency) are identified by the developed algorithm, which is based on a constrained minimization approach. The proposed identification procedure was applied to the data collected on an instrumented high-range agricultural vehicle during a series of handling maneuvers carried out at different inflation pressures.

40|$|Understanding how {{the nervous}} system {{recognises}} salient stimuli in the environ- ment and selects and executes the appropriate behavioural responses is a fundamen- tal question in systems neuroscience. To facilitate the neuroethological study of visually-guided behaviour in larval zebrafish, we developed virtual reality assays in which precisely controlled visual cues can be presented to larvae whilst their behaviour is automatically monitored using machine-vision algorithms. Freely swimming larvae responded to moving stimuli in a size-dependent manner: they directed multiple low amplitude orienting turns (∼ 20 ◦) towards small moving spots (1 ◦) but reacted to larger spots (10 ◦) with high-amplitude aversive turns (∼ 60 ◦). The tracking of small spots led us to examine how larvae respond to prey during hunting routines. By analysing movie sequences of larvae hunting parame- cia, we discovered that all prey capture routines commence with eye convergence and larvae maintain their eyes in a highly converged position {{for the duration of}} the prey-tracking and capture swim phases. We adapted our virtual reality assay to deliver artificial visual cues to partially restrained larvae and found that small moving spots evoked convergent eye movements and <b>J-turns</b> of the tail, which are defining features of natural hunting. We propose that eye convergence represents the engagement of a predatory mode of behaviour in larval fish and serves to increase the region of binocular visual space to enable stereoscopic targeting of prey...|$|R

40|$|Since 2006, INDOT {{has been}} {{preparing}} an annual five-percent report that identifies intersections and segments on Indiana state roads that require attention due to the excessive number and severity of crashes. Many of the identified intersections are two-way, stop-controlled intersections located on high-speed, multi-lane, rural roads. Some contributing design and human factors have been identified while other factors still await investigation. Multivariate ordered probit models {{have been developed to}} help identify additional factors of the frequency and severity of crashes. These models can estimate how much different factors increase the frequency of crashes at several levels of injury severity (fatal/incapacitating, non-incapacitating/ possible, property-damage-only). They have a unique ability to account for unobserved but common conditions that affect all of the crash severity levels. Recommendations for safety countermeasures are made based on both of these research results and our study of published reports of other authors. The statistical analysis was performed on 553 existing intersections in Indiana and 72 existing intersections in Michigan using crash data reported during a four-year period. The identified safety factors include: presence of horizontal curves within the intersection vicinity, traffic volume on the major road, land use, population of the area surrounding the intersection, and the minor road functional class (traffic volume on minor road unknown), nearby at-grade railroad crossings, intersection conspicuity to drivers on the major road, acceleration lanes for both left and right turns, median width, intersection angle, and number of intersection legs. These results are in line with other research results as documented in the literature review. Based on the results of this and other studies, recommendations are made to improve safety at new intersections as well as at existing intersections. For new intersections, construction of medians wider than 80 feet is suggested. Where this is not possible and a narrower median needs to be constructed, adding a parallel acceleration lane for vehicles turning left from the minor road is suggested. Intersections should be placed at a sufficient distance from horizontal curves and from at-grade railroad crossings. Solutions with indirect left-turn lanes (Michigan U-turns, <b>J-turns)</b> are recommended. At existing intersections experiencing excessive numbers of crashes involving vehicles from the minor road, median closure should be considered or a median opening should be restricted to certain maneuvers. Median acceleration lanes can be added in order to allow a two-stage maneuver for left turns from the minor road. Enhanced guide and warning signage can be used to improve intersection conspicuity; adding road illumination can especially help at night. The practice of adding left- and right-turn bays should be continued as this is a proven intersection safety improvement practice. Applying these countermeasures may help improve safety and avoid the construction of expensive grade separations. Finally, advanced intersection collision avoidance systems, such as road-side dynamic signs warning drivers on the minor road about a short gap on the major road, should be the subject of pilot studies in Indiana. Experiments in other states have indicated that these systems help drivers choose safe gaps...|$|R
50|$|Handbrake <b>J-Turn</b> - The contestants {{are taught}} by Philippe {{on how to}} perform a Forward Handbrake <b>J-Turn</b> (a {{modified}} bootleg turn), as first seen on Canada's Worst Driver 3. The key to the technique {{is to make the}} car front-heavy by taking the foot off the gas, before using the pendulum effect (turning right before a sudden turn to the left) and the handbrake to swing around (this process is known as a Scandinavian flick). For the challenge, the contestants must accelerate to 50 km/h, making the turn around a foam figure. Contestants have five attempts before being forced to retire. Angelina hits the brakes, and loses control of the car, failing her five attempts. Jakob and Mike both make it on their fifth attempts after a few close calls. Crystal fails her five attempts, her last knocking down the foam figure. Though Arun is next to go (and Father Giles is last), a personal tragedy happens to Crystal while awaiting for the course to reset: she receives word from her mother that her brother-in-law, Tom Stagno, has been killed in an automobile/motorcycle collision. Tom had been killed while riding a motorcycle on Essex County Road 2 near Lakeshore, Ontario when a driver had failed to stop at a stop sign, colliding into him as he tried to proceed across the intersection. The driver of the automobile was charged with failure to yield.|$|E
50|$|A superstreet, {{also known}} as a {{restricted}} crossing U-turn (RCUT), <b>J-turn,</b> or reduced conflict intersection, is a type of road intersection that is a variation of the Michigan left. In this configuration, traffic on the minor road is not permitted to proceed straight across the major road or highway. Drivers wishing to turn left or go straight must turn right onto the major road, then, a short distance away, queue (wait) into a designated U-turn (or crossover) lane in the median.

Lance fails his first three runs by triggering both the handbrake and footbrake before making the turn, and then fails his next three by triggering the handbrake too late. Lance then fails his last chance by failing to find the hand brake (as he had taken his hand off of it).

Michael also passes on his first go, though comes close to hitting the boxes {{on the outside of the}} turning area. Kevin, while seeming to broadly understand the technique, fails all three of his runs due to staying on the gas for too long, and also leaving it too late to brake.

None of the five sites exhibited a fatal crash following <b>J-turn</b> implementation. This five-site analysis showed that annual right angle crashes decreased from 6. 3 to 1. 3, a 80 % reduction. One of the most severe crash types, the left turn, right angle crash, was completely eliminated by the <b>J-turn.</b> One conflict measure, average time to collision, was found to be four times higher at the <b>J-turn</b> site compared to the control TWSC site among minor road turning vehicles, indicating greater safety at the <b>J-turn</b> site.

The elimination of fatal crashes and a significant reduction in disabling injury crashes are substantial safety improvements offered by the <b>J-turn</b> design. One of the most severe crash types, the left turn right angle crashes was completely eliminated by the <b>J-turn.</b> Rear-end, sideswipe, and passing crashes also decreased postIncludes bibliographical references (page 78) ...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International A full {{vehicle model}} of the RTV is {{developed}} in MADYMO including steering, tire and suspension. A torque controller is simulated to maintain set speed of the RTV in simulations. The suspension characteristics were validated using experimental accelerations measured over bumps. The model is used to predict rollover limits using Slowly Increasing Steer, <b>J-Turn,</b> and Road Edge Recovery maneuvers. The rollover limits under three different loading states, RTV without passengers, RTV with unrestrained passengers, and the RTV with restrained passengers have been studied...|$|E

For lateral and yaw dynamics analysis, nonlinear and linear vehicle models are utilized as actual vehicle plant and for controller design respectively. The designed controller is evaluated using <b>J-turn</b> cornering manoeuvre condition in computer simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the application of CNF for yaw rate tracking control improves the yaw stability and vehicle handling performances...|$|E
