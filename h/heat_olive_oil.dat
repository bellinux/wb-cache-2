For the processing of large data sets multivariate analytical method as Principal component analysis and Cluster analysis are applied to find the patterns within the data. The evaluation of process of thermal degradation is also based on the major decomposition product of oxidized linoleate appearing in spectra via band 1640 cm− 1.

40|$|The fluorophores {{present in}} virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> evolve during any thermoxidation process and thereby {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{can be used}} as a straightforward approach to study the oxidative degree of oils. Samples of <b>heated</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> collected from a fryer every two hours up to 94 h were analyzed to study their excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and the evolution of the fluorescent composition during the thermoxidation process. The potential usefulness of EEM to study thermoxidized virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> has been explored. For this purpose, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to interpret the results. The emission profile obtained from three-factor PARAFAC model calculated for 47 samples of thermoxidized oil in the range of Î» ex= 250 - 298 nm and Î» em= 300 - 700 nm allows the decomposition of the fluorescence landscape in specific information about phenols, pigments and oxidation products respectively.

40|$|AbstractMultivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) is a curve {{resolution}} method {{based on}} a bilinear model which assumes that the observed spectra are a linear combination of the spectra of the pure components in the system. The algorithm steps include {{the determination of the}} number of components by rank analysis methods, initial estimates for the concentrations and/or spectra and an iterative optimization. Sometimes, suitable results may not be achieved when MCR-ALS is applied. One reason for this is the importance of the initial estimates of the spectral profiles. In that case, the MCR-ALS algorithm may reach a local minimum instead of a global minimum and this can result in ineffective curve resolution. The most popular algorithm used to find the initial estimates (PURE derived from SIMPLISMA) suffers from an essential drawback, which is the necessity to have “pure” variables related to a single spectral component, which cannot be expected in all cases because of the strong signal overlapping as in the Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy. This work summarizes this problem, presenting a case study based on UV–Vis spectroscopy of <b>heated</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> To solve the problems of the need for “pure” variables and to avoid local minima with MCR-ALS, Independent Components Analysis (ICA) was used to calculate initial estimates for MCR-ALS. The results from this study suggest that this use of ICA prior to MCR-ALS improves the resolution for UV–Vis data and provides acceptable resolution results when compared to the most used method, PURE...|$|R
40|$|Frying {{is one of}} the few {{methods of}} cooking common to the entire Mediterranean area. It is used for both {{domestic}} and industrial preparation of food. During frying, as a results of <b>heating,</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (VOOs) undergos a complex series of degradation reactions. In the present work, the changes in the different chemical families of the aroma of the virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (VOO) subject to a heating at frying temperature (180 °C) for 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 hours, was carried out.

The regions of the fluorescence spectra of the heated oils, diluted in hexane at 1 %, were explained by the content of these compounds with regression coefficients higher than 0. 90 (R 2 adjusted). The fluorescence intensity recorded at 350 nm and the wavelength of the spectrum maximum in the range of 390 − 630 nm also allowed for the explanation of the increase of the percentage of polar compounds during the experiment. On the other hand, the spectra of the undiluted heated oils indicated that the maximum of the spectrum of any undiluted oil at 490 nm or beyond is related to a percentage of the polar compounds higher than 25 %, which is the maximum percentage accepted for edible oils used in frying processes.

Blend <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are sometimes mixtures containing "lampante" oils submitted to thermal deodoration processes.

Our lab has been conducting for some years research in this field by the use of advanced analytical techniques, mainly mass spectrometry. <b>Olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced by legal processes have been compared to refined oils in order to find possible differences in the fatty acids composition. The fatty acids portion of oil has been converted into methyl esters and analyzed by GC-MS, using a Varian 2000 instrument. EI-MS, isobuthane and acetonitrile CI-MS and CI-MS/MS based methods have been used in order to elucidate the structure of an apparently anomalous component present at trace levels. Preliminary GC-FID experiments showed the appearance of a anomalous peak located at higher retention times with respect to linoleic acid methyl ester. Its intensity seems {{to be related to the}} <b>heating</b> of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> samples, remaining, anyway, at trace levels. EI-MS and isobuthane CI-MS measurements allowed to determine the molecular weight, 294 Da, and the candidate structure that could be related to a C 18 : 2 FAME. Its retention time, significatively higher with respect to linoleic acid methyl esther suggested the possibility of a conjugated isomer. In fact, further acetonitrile CI-MS and CI-MS-MS experiments lead to the complete structure elucidation of this component, resulting in the 9, 11 - 18 : 2 isomer. A definitive confirmation of the structure have been obtained by comparison with authentic 9, 11 -C 18 : 2 standars, allowing also the determination of the stereochemistry, so that the compound under investigation resulted to be methyl 9 (E), 11 (E) -octadecadienoate.

In average, virgin oils had relatively low levels of bound 3 -MCPD ranging from < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to < 300 ƒÝg/kg (LOQ). Higher levels of bound 3 -MCPD were found in oils obtained from roasted oilseeds (337 ƒÝg/kg) and {{in the majority of}} refined oils (< 300 ƒÝg/kg to 2462 ƒÝg/kg), including refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> In general, it appears that the formation of bound 3 -MCPD in oils is linked with the preliminary heat treatment of oilseeds and with the process of oil refining. The analysis of unrefined, degummed, bleached, and deodorized rapeseed oil showed that the level of bound MCPD decreased during the refining process. However, additional heating of seed oils for 30 minutes at temperatures ranging from 100 oC to 280 oC, and heating at 230 oC (260 oC) for up to 8 hours led to an increase of the bound 3 -MCPD level.

In delta(13) C values determined for the aliphatic alcoholic fraction of pomace oil, the adulterant was significantly more negative than those of virgin and refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> Quantitative analysis of isoprenoids and methylsterols isolated from each grade of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> supports the decreasingly negative values of C- 13 /C- 12 ratios for the better grades of <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> These results {{have turned out to}} be a good tool for detecting adulteration of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with the cheaper pomace <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> even down to a 5 % level...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} {{organoleptic}} evaluation {{given by the}} different laboratories {{turned out to be}} in disagreement. For instance, all samples were judged virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> due to a median of defects > 0 according to the Lazio lab results, whereas all samples, except one, were judged EVOOs according to the Sicilian lab results. Samples Ou 1, Ou 2, Ou 3 and Ou 5 turned out to be lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> or EVOOs according to the lab, whereas sample Ou 7 was judged lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Finally, samples Ou 4, Ou 6 and Ou 8 were judged virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> or EVOOs according to the labs.|$|R
