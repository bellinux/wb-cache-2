In addition, the recent Communication on a European Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS 3) outlines the need to modernize and simplify the collection, exchange and use of data and information required for the design, implementation and monitoring of environmental policy. These policy drivers present challenges in the actual identification and comparison of often heterogeneous systems within the environmental information sharing domain; including the processes and resources which support the capture/discovery, processing, validation, analysis and dissemination of data/information about the environment. To address this challenge, we present a method to gather and analyze the components of environmental information systems that can {{contribute to the development of}} information infrastructures such as SEIS. Our approach is described as (principally) 2 ̆ 7 bottom-up 2 ̆ 7 : a community of practitioners propose candidate systems for analysis, illustrating what approaches are currently adopted to create, manage, use environmental data/information that aim to meet the goals/principles (or 2 ̆ 7 top-down 2 ̆ 7 setting) of the SEIS policy arena, while also informing this policy 2 ̆ 7 s development itself...|$|E

Nowadays, service <b>interoperability</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as workflows and static service-oriented architectures, are giving place to more dynamic environments, where the path from the original resource to the integrative destination is triggered autonomously and in real-time. However, these concepts still have not been applied to bioinformatics, in great {{part due to the}} complexity underlying the data validation and transformation tasks. In this manuscript we introduce a component to enhance these activities by enabling the execution of complex pre- and post-integration semantic algorithms.

The method used to carry out the research consists of three main phases: the analysis of information interoperability related technologies, the design of a model to evaluate information interoperability in public web sites, and the empirical analysis of key factors affecting information interoperability.

30|$|We found a {{previously}} published work on evaluation models for interoperability (Rezaei et al. 2014) which describes existing models {{and offers a}} comparative analysis highlighting major {{similarities and differences between}} them. However, the authors conclude that these existing interoperability evaluation models are not applicable to cloud computing. We too, could not find any evaluation model for cloud interoperability in the selected studies. This may suggest an open challenge to be addressed in the future. Such an evaluation model for cloud interoperability could be a good contribution to this area of research. We believe Rezaei et al. (2014) work can serve as basis to propose some evaluation model. Due heterogeneity of interoperable cloud services, their usage scenarios and requirements, we believe only one model for evaluating is not enough. It is needed to propose many models, each one aligned with the context of <b>interoperability</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|R

This paper presents a definition of an <b>interoperability</b> <b>strategy</b> for an e-Learning environment at our School (ESEIG) called PEACE – Project for ESEIG Academic Content Environment.
