25|$|A <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> usually {{involves}} running one track in each direction, {{compared to a}} single-track railway where trains in both directions share the same track.|$|E
25|$|The two {{tracks of}} a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> {{do not have}} to follow the same {{alignment}} if the terrain is difficult. At Frampton, New South Wales, Australia, the uphill track follows something of a horseshoe curve at 1 in 75 gradient, while the shorter downhill track follows the original single track at 1 in 40 grades.|$|E
25|$|When one {{track of}} a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> {{is out of}} service for {{maintenance}} or a train breaks down, all trains may be concentrated on the one good track. There may be bi-directional signalling and suitable crossovers to enable trains {{to move on to}} the other track expeditiously (see, for example, the article on the Channel Tunnel), or there may be some kind of manual safeworking to control trains on what is now a section of single track. See single-line working.|$|E
25|$|<b>Double-track</b> <b>railways,</b> {{especially}} older ones, may use each track {{exclusively in}} one direction. This arrangement simplifies the signalling systems, especially where the signalling is mechanical (e.g. semaphore signals).|$|R
50|$|The Western Railway {{consists}} of the <b>double-track</b> Old Western <b>Railway</b> (Alten Westbahn, line 1) and the <b>double-track</b> New Western <b>Railway</b> (Neuen Westbahn, line 30).|$|R
50|$|The freight bypass railway {{is one of}} {{the main}} <b>double-track</b> <b>railways</b> in Germany. Due to the line being largely shared by traffic running north-south between {{seaports}} and the hinterland and traffic running east-west, trains run virtually continuously. The fact that lines running parallel with it have been dismantled or are not electrified (such as the Elze-Löhne railway), mean that there is such a strong concentration of traffic that minor events on the line can lead to traffic jams.|$|R
25|$|The {{commuter}} rail system includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the Ring Rail Line, an urban <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> with a {{station at the}} Helsinki Airport in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated as of 2017, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.|$|E
25|$|When the {{capacity}} of a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> is in excess of requirements, the two tracks may be reduced to one. In some countries this is called singling. Notable examples {{of this in the}} United Kingdom occurred on the Oxford-Worcester-Hereford, Princes Risborough-Banbury and Salisbury-Exeter main lines during the 1970s and 1980s. In all these cases, increases in traffic from the late 1990s have led to the partial reinstatement of double track. In New Zealand the Melling Line was singled to the Western Hutt Railway Station in Lower Hutt in 1958 after it became a branch line rather than part of the main Hutt Valley Line.|$|E
25|$|Three Pan-European {{transport}} {{corridors and}} corridor branches run through Croatia proper. The corridor Vb encompasses the A4 motorway, spanning from Zagreb to Varaždin and {{the border of}} Hungary, and {{a section of the}} A1 and A6 motorways, extending south of Zagreb towards Karlovac and Rijeka. The transport corridor also contains a parallel railway line connecting the Port of Rijeka and Budapest via Zagreb. The second major transport route is the corridor X, represented as the A3 motorway and a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> spanning the region from west to east, as well as the A2 motorway—the Xa branch of the corridor X. The three routes form junctions near Zagreb.|$|E
50|$|The Magdeburg-Leipzig <b>railway</b> is a <b>double-track,</b> {{electrified}} <b>railway</b> in the German {{states of}} Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, connecting Magdeburg via Köthen, Halle and Unna to Leipzig.|$|R
50|$|As an {{extension}} of the future Daegok-Sosa-Wonsi Line, the Gyooe Line may be upgraded to a <b>double-track,</b> electrified <b>railway,</b> and see regular passenger service integrated into the Seoul Metropolitan Subway.|$|R
50|$|The Rheydt-Cologne railway is {{a mostly}} <b>double-track</b> {{electrified}} <b>railway</b> in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia between Rheydt and Cologne-Ehrenfeld. Only the section between Rheydt Hauptbahnhof and Rheydt-Odenkirchen is single track.|$|R
25|$|Pickering {{station has}} been its {{terminus}} since 1965 when the Malton-Pickering route connecting to the York to Scarborough main line was closed. Before the station became a terminus, the <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> took up the space now occupied by The Ropery (a road) and the car park to the east. Trains run daily from mid-March to early November and on selected dates through the winter. Trains are mostly steam-hauled; however in some cases heritage diesel engine is used. At {{the height of the}} running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. During the summer months, steam services extend to the seaside town of Whitby. Passenger numbers have topped 350,000 in recent years.|$|E
500|$|This {{is named}} [...] "Double Bridges and Footbridge 49A" [...] by the Canal & River Trust. [...] The bridge carries a footway and <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> over the Navigation. [...] This {{section of the}} Navigation must have {{represented}} quite a challenge for full-size barges to negotiate since the bridges are immediately adjacent to a right-angle bend in the canal.|$|E
500|$|This bridge {{conveys the}} (ex-Great Central Railway) Doncaster-to-Hull railway over the Navigation. [...] The bridge {{consists}} of two single-span decks, both with above deck trusses. [...] The older south deck (pictured here) is no longer used. [...] The north deck accommodates both tracks {{of what is now}} a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway.</b> [...] The quadruple track from Thorne Junction on this line now finishes at Kirk Sandall Junction, a few hundred metres to the east. [...] A further bridge to the west conveys the railway over the River Don.|$|E
50|$|The Main Railway (German: Mainbahn, {{pronounced}} 'mine barn') is a 37.5 km-long <b>double-track</b> electrified <b>railway</b> line, {{which runs}} {{on the south side}} of the Main River from Mainz to Frankfurt central station.|$|R
5000|$|The Taiyuan-Zhongwei-Yichuan Railway (...) is {{a railway}} line in {{northern}} China, connecting Taiyuan, {{the capital of}} Shanxi Province, with Zhongwei and Yinchuan in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It is a <b>double-track</b> electric <b>railway,</b> opened in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Several {{major road}} and rail lines run {{parallel}} to the river: the A32 motorway from Torino to Bardonecchia; state highway SS535, Strada Statale di Bardonecchia; the international <b>double-track</b> Fréjus <b>railway,</b> the main line of the Rome-Torino-Paris run.|$|R
500|$|The gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of the five counties in Slavonia combined (in year 2008) amounted to 6,454million euro, or 8,005euro per capita—27.5% below Croatia's national average. The GDP of the five counties represented 13.6% of Croatia's GDP. Several Pan-European transport corridors run through Slavonia: corridor Vc as the A5 motorway, corridor X as the A3 motorway and a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> spanning Slavonia from west to east, and corridor VII—the Danube River waterway. The waterway is accessed through the Port of Vukovar, the largest Croatian river port, situated on the Danube itself, and the Port of Osijek on the Drava River, [...] away from confluence of the rivers.|$|E
500|$|The Oslo Tunnel (...) is a , <b>double-track,</b> <b>railway</b> tunnel {{which runs}} between Olav Kyrres plass and Oslo Central Station (OsloS) in Oslo, Norway. The tunnel {{constitutes}} the eastern-most {{section of the}} Drammen Line and runs below the central business district of Oslo. It features the four-track Nationaltheatret Station, Norway's second-busiest railway station, where the Oslo Tunnels lies directly beneath the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro. At Frogner, the Elisenberg Station was built, but has never been used. The tunnel is the busiest section of railway line in Norway and serves all west-bound trains from Oslo, including many services of the Oslo Commuter Rail and the Airport Express Train.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the railway mania railway companies became an unpopular investment and the necessary finance could not be raised. The company suggested at a meeting in November 1849 that whereas £650,000 was needed for a <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> from Aberdeen to Inverness, only £375,000 would be needed for a single-track railway from Kittybrewster, [...] from Aberdeen, to Keith, half way to Inverness. The meeting recommended that the bridges and works be built wide enough for a second track when this was needed. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit to Huntly, [...] short of Keith, with William Cubitt as engineer. The severe winter the following year delayed work. Between Inverurie and Aberdeen the line took over the Aberdeenshire Canal, the purchase of which delayed construction as it was necessary to settle the claims of each shareholder individually.|$|E
5000|$|Nanning-Kunming High-Speed Railway (formerly {{known as}} the Yunnan-Guangxi High-Speed Railway) is a {{high-speed}} railway in China's Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It connects the Guangxi capital of Nanning with the Yunnan capital city of Kunming. It will have a total length of 715.8 kilometres of electrified <b>double-track</b> <b>railways,</b> built to the Grade 1 standard. Positioned as part of China's [...] "long-term railway network plan", to improve the layout {{and the development of}} South-Western China with critical infrastructure. It will be Yunnan Province's first high-speed transport corridor to the sea. With future Pan-Asian railways to Laos, Thailand and Vietnam planned or under construction, this railway will be seen as a crucial link between the economic powerhouse of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone and Indochina under the Chinese One Belt-One Road policies.|$|R
25|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} included a <b>double-track</b> commuter <b>railway</b> connecting Tuen Mun Station and Nam Cheong Station in newly reclaimed West Kowloon, {{at a cost of}} HK$46.4 billion in 2002 prices which was some 28% lower than the original estimate in 1998; later reports cite $51.7 billion in money of the day prices.|$|R
5000|$|Jilin-Hunchun Intercity Railway, {{also known}} as Ji-Hun Passenger Dedicated Line, is a {{high-speed}} railway in China's Jilin Province. It connects the provincial capital of Jilin City and the eastern provincial city of Hunchun near the border with Russia and North Korea. It will have a total length of 359 km of electrified <b>double-track</b> <b>railways,</b> built to the Grade 1 standard. Project construction started on October 30, 2010, with operations commencing on September 20, 2015. The railway {{has been described as}} [...] "Dongbei's most beautiful railway" [...] (due to the terrain it runs through) and [...] "the fastest way to Vladivostok" [...] (4 hours by train from Shenyang to Hunchun, plus 4 hours by bus from Hunchun to Vladivostok). Reflecting the border location of the city, the new train station has its sign in four languages: Chinese, Korean, Russian, and English. Future prospects could see the line extended into Russia to Vladivostok.|$|R
500|$|Tanum Tunnel (...) is [...] <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> tunnel on the Asker Line, between Jong in Bærum and Åstad in Asker, Norway. It {{was built}} {{as part of}} the first state of the Asker Line, between Asker and Sandvika; {{construction}} started in February 2002 and the tunnel opened on 27 August 2005. The tunnel was built by AF Gruppen for the Norwegian National Rail Administration. Most of the tunneling was conducted using the drilling and blasting method, although the easternmost [...] were built using the cut-and-cover method. After the tunnel opened, there have been problems with leaks damaging the superstructure. The tunnel has double track, is electrified and allows for a maximum speed of [...] The cost to build the tunnel, excluding the superstructure, was 370 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The tunnel will accelerate intercity and regional traffic west of Oslo and free up capacity for the Oslo Commuter Rail on the Drammen Line.|$|E
500|$|The Port of Rijeka {{is located}} on the Kvarner Gulf in the {{northern}} Adriatic Sea, centered on the city of Rijeka. The facilities include terminals and other structures in the city and in the area reaching from the Bay of Bakar, where the bulk cargo terminal is located, approximately [...] east of Rijeka, to Bršica to the west of Rijeka, where there is a multi-purpose terminal. The Port of Rijeka is at the southern terminus of the Pan-European transport network Corridor Vb, representing a maritime extension of the rail and road routes leading to and from Rijeka. They include modern roads such as the A6 motorway, forming a part of the European route E65 and connecting Zagreb, Budapest and Vienna, and the A7 motorway, a part of the European route E61 and the E65. Rail links comprise single-track railway lines to Zagreb and to Pivka, Slovenia. There are plans to upgrade to a high-performance, <b>double-track</b> <b>railway.</b>|$|E
500|$|A [...] <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> {{had been}} {{proposed}} from Lossiemouth to Craigellachie in 1841 and necessary permissions granted in 1846, the route having changed {{to take advantage}} of the proposed Great North of Scotland Railway between Elgin and Orton. The financial situation delayed construction, but work eventually started on the section from Lossiemouth to Elgin in 1851. The [...] line opened on 10 August 1852 with a special train from Elgin to festivities in Lossiemouth. Public services started the next day with five services a day, each taking 15 minutes with two request stops. First and second class accommodation was provided at d and 1d a mile. However, it was the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR) who was to build the line from Elgin to Orton; permission to build a branch from this line to Rothes was granted to the Morayshire on 14 July 1856. The IAJR built its own station at Elgin, linked to the Morayshire's station by a junction to the east. The IAJR opened on 18 August 1858 and the Morayshire Railway started running services on 23 August.|$|E

2500|$|Tornado moved {{under her}} own {{power for the}} first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the {{preserved}} Great Central <b>Railway</b> <b>double-track</b> tourist <b>railway</b> in Loughborough, where she was tested up to [...] and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to [...] After repainting from works grey into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for mainline passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800,000 debt from the project, which cost around £3million.|$|R
50|$|The Freilassing-Berchtesgaden railway is an {{electrified}} line {{listed in the}} Deutsche Bahn timetable as route 954. The 33.671 km long route branches in Freilassing as a single-track line from the <b>double-track</b> Rosenheim-Salzburg <b>railway.</b> It is classified as a line as far as Bad Reichenhall and from there as branch line. The section between Bad Reichenhall-Kirchberg and Hallthurm is considered a steep section with specific operational requirements under Deutsche Bahn’s regulations.|$|R
500|$|The line is {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: {{a central}} conductor rail is energised at−210V and a rail outside the running rails at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V. Much of the [...] <b>double-track</b> <b>railway</b> from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a [...] high brick viaduct. After Westbourne Park the line passes beneath the Great Western main line re-surfacing at Royal Oak station and running alongside the main lines to Paddington station. The line enters a cutting {{just west of}} the station and a cut-and-cover tunnel {{at the end of the}} platforms. It meets the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware Road station in a cutting. After King's Cross St Pancras the line is in cutting, passing under the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the City Widened Lines used for Thameslink services. There are bay platforms at Moorgate. Just before Aldgate the line diverges from the Circle and Metropolitan lines to Aldgate East. The line passes over the London Overground at Whitechapel station continuing on the [...] former Whitechapel & Bow Railway to Bow Road where it surfaces, and then to Bromley-by-Bow, where it runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line from Fenchurch Street. At the next station, West Ham, there is interchange with the Jubilee line, the Docklands Light Railway and c2c. There is a bay platform at the next station, Plaistow, and the line terminates after two more stations at Barking.|$|E
500|$|The Limpet Mill Scheme {{was a line}} {{presented}} in an 1862 bill by the nominally independent Scottish Northern Junction Railway, but supported by the SNER. This proposed a [...] long railway between Limpet Mill, {{to the north of}} [...] on the SNER, to the Great North at Kintore. A junction with the Deeside Railway was also planned, over which the SNER unsuccessfully tried to obtain running rights. Unpopular, this was given permission by parliament, but the Great North succeeded in inserting a clause that this would be suspended if it obtained an Act by 1 September 1863. The Great North proposed a route, known locally as the Circumbendibus, that was longer but cheaper than the direct route through the Denburn Valley. Despite local opposition, the route was approved by parliament in 1863, but was revoked the following year when the SNER obtained permission for a railway through the Denburn Valley. The Great North contributed the £125,000 that its Circumbendibus line would have cost and the SNER contributed £70,000 out of the £90,000 it had been prepared to advance the Limpet Mill Scheme. The SNER built the <b>double-track</b> <b>railway,</b> culverting the Denburn and digging two short tunnels. The joint station opened on 4 November 1867 and consisted of three through tracks, one with a long platform, together with two bay platforms for terminating trains at either end. Two lines to the west were provided for goods traffic, and the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street closed to passengers and became goods terminals. The line {{to the north of the}} station passed to the Great North and the [...] long Hutcheon Street tunnel became its longest.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the route}} was {{to follow the}} coast from Exeter to Newton (later called Newton Abbot), from there to Plymouth it would need to run over {{difficult}} hilly terrain, and gradients and curvature were challenging. Brunel had planned the route as a <b>double-track</b> locomotive <b>railway,</b> and as late as May 1844 he stated, {{in reference to the}} atmospheric system, [...] "I have not been called upon to recommend it or not".|$|R
25|$|Historically {{the train}} line used to {{terminate}} at a {{station on the}} right {{bank of the river}} Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a <b>double-track</b> steel <b>railway</b> bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.|$|R
