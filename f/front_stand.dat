50|$|Production of the Black Knight {{began in}} the spring of 1955. Lucas {{components}} replaced the less reliable Miller electrical system and ignition was upgraded to coil and distributor. The rear enclosure, which incorporated the oil tank, was hinged allowing access to the rear wheel and final drive chain. Amal Monobloc carburettors improved starting. The centre stand was operated by a lever accessible from the saddle and the lower front mudguard stay served as an emergency <b>front</b> <b>stand</b> to facilitate the removal of the front wheel. Delay in delivery of the fibreglas components from subcontractors held back the availability of the first production bikes until spring 1955. Approximately 200 of the enclosed models were built.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2005, Microsoft {{introduced}} the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, including an integrated leatherette wrist rest, noticeably concave key banks, and a removable <b>front</b> <b>stand</b> to help straighten {{the wrist and}} allow the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys. The multimedia keys have again been redesigned, and the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 2×3 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to [...] "on", providing the original function key features rather than the new [...] "enhanced" [...] functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 has the indicator lights for Caps lock, etc. moved back to between the banks of keys, although they are now below the Space bar, rather than above. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on, with less of the distinctive [...] "click clack" [...] noise that is common with older keyboards. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. The 4000 is available in two variants, Business and Retail. The exact differences are not known, although product descriptions imply that the packaging is different, and prices are often slightly higher for the Business edition.|$|E
50|$|Pieces of {{sculpture}} and inscriptions are protected in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Following {{the slope of}} the hill was the seating area where the spectators at the ancient Dionysia sat to watch the plays taking place in the oblong orchestral area below, now defined by four fragments of marble thrones (K) for the priests {{at the bottom of the}} slope, and a row of stones (O) which supported the tent (σκηνη) behind which the actors changed, which also stood as the backdrop for the ‘orchestra’ (dance floor) where all acting took place. This theatrical area is downwards to the right as we enter the site from the modern road. To the left of the orchestra there is a large base (I) made of large and small slabs of marble set in the ground; This may be the base of the altar of the god Dionysos which always stood near or in an ancient theatre. Another possibility is that it was the altar of Apollo, whose temple (H) stood just to the left and is positively identified by its threshold block, a huge piece of marble inscribed ΙΚΑΡΙΩΝ ΤΟ ΠΥΘΙΟΝ, or ‘The Temple of Apollo of the Ikarians’. Just in <b>front</b> <b>stand</b> many bases for votive offerings (statues and inscriptions dedicated to the god) and inside the one room temple stands the base of the cult statue of Apollo, of which no trace has been found.|$|E

The practice of changing the scenography of the High Altar was a Jesuit innovation. The throne at São Roque (usually not visible to the public) was one of the first permanent ones to be created in Portugal. It has six Corinthian columns and four arches, round geometric elements and two large carved and gilded side panels with symbolic trees in relief. The whole forms a sort of pyramid in several levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For the {{communication}} between human and computer in an interactive computing environment, the gesture recognition is studied vigorously. Therefore, {{a lot of}} studies have proposed efficient methods about the recognition algorithm using 2 D camera captured images. However, there is a limitation to these methods, such as the extracted features cannot fully represent the object in real world. Although many studies used 3 D features instead of 2 D features for more accurate gesture recognition, the problem, such as the processing time to generate 3 D objects, is still unsolved in related researches. Therefore we propose a method to extract the 3 D features combined with the 3 D object reconstruction. This method uses the modified GPU-based visual hull generation algorithm which disables unnecessary processes, such as the texture calculation to generate three kinds of 3 D projection maps as the 3 D feature: a nearest boundary, a farthest boundary, and a thickness of the object projected on the base-plane. In the section of experimental results, we present results of proposed method on eight human postures: T shape, both hands up, right hand up, left hand up, hands <b>front,</b> <b>stand,</b> sit and bend, and compare the computational time of the proposed method {{with that of the}} previous methods...|$|E
