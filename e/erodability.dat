40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the interplay between biofilms and <b>erodability</b> of {{cohesive}} sediments. Erosion experiments were run in four laboratory annular flumes with natural sediments. After each erosion the sediment was allowed to settle, mimicking intermittent physical processes like tidal currents and waves. The time between consecutive erosion events ranged from 1 to 12 days. Turbidity of the water column caused by sediment resuspension {{was used to determine}} the <b>erodability</b> of the sediments with respect to small and moderate shear stresses. <b>Erodability</b> was also compared {{on the basis of the}} presence of benthic biofilms, which were quantified using a Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM) Underwater Fluorometer. We found that frequent erosion lead to the establishment of a weak biofilm, which reduced sediment erosion at small shear stresses (around 0. 1 Pa). If prolonged periods without erosion were present, the biofilm fully established, resulting in lower erosion at moderate shear stresses (around 0. 4 Pa). We conclude that an unstructured extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix always affect sediment <b>erodability</b> at low shear stresses, while only a fully developed biofilm mat can reduce sediment <b>erodability</b> at moderate shear stresses...|$|E

Here we study {{the effect of}} nutrient enrichment and several meteorological and hydrodynamic parameters on the <b>erodability</b> of mudflat substrates when they are emergent. We tested the impact of nutrient fertilization on tidal flat sediments over a two week period in September 2011 in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts (USA). High resolution measurements from our experiment indicate that daily nutrient enrichment at 70 μM NO 3 ‾ using our experimental approach {{does not change the}} critical shear stress of the muddy substrate, nor affect the concentration of chlorophyll a at the surface. Sediment <b>erodability</b> is instead directly related to the potential evaporation rate and to the duration of the subaerial period. Chlorophyll a concentration decreases when evaporation is high, possibly due to the downward migration of diatoms. Sediment concentrations in the water column during submergence strongly depend on bottom shear stresses triggered by tidal currents. Surprisingly, they are also related to the total evaporation that occurred in the previous emergence period. We conclude that subaerial desiccation at low tide decreases the <b>erodability</b> of mudflat sediments. This strengthening effect is not lost during the following submerged period, thus limiting the erosive effect of tidal currents. For the first time we show that not only subaqueous but also subaerial processes control the <b>erodability</b> of mudflats. Global warming and other climatic variations regulating long-term evaporation rates can therefore directly affect the stability of mudflats in mesotidal environments...|$|E

40|$|Urbanisation {{in coastal}} {{catchments}} has significantly increased {{not only the}} input of terrestrial sediment to the marine environment but also the input of contaminants. In Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, heavy metals have accumulated in the upper estuarine muddy sediments and metal contamination has been detected on downstream intertidal sandflats. Sub-lethal levels of heavy metal contamination may affect the growth and behaviour of benthic organisms, which in turn may influence key ecosystem processes and productivity. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether the burial rate of an ecologically important bivalve species (Austrovenus stutchburyi) differed between a contaminated and a lesser-contaminated site and whether burial rates were affected by density. A secondary aim was to determine whether the burial of Austrovenus affected sediment transport and consequently if this was affected by density. This study demonstrated no consistent difference in burial time between source populations (sites). This was explained by a lack of measured difference in the condition index and heavy metal tissue loading of Austrovenus used throughout this study. The present range of contamination measured in Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, did not have negative biological consequences on the key ecosystem engineer, Austrovenus stutchburyi. Contamination levels in Tamaki Estuary may not be high enough to cause major physiological or behaviour changes to infaunal organisms, such as Austrovenus. Sediment <b>erodability</b> was not significantly correlated with any measured environmental and biotic factors. Austrovenus density was the only predictor variable that could be used to explain any variation in sediment <b>erodability.</b> There was no significant density effects observed between the amounts of sediment eroded for densities gt; 150 ind. m- 2. There was a significant difference between sediment void of Austrovenus (0 ind. m- 2; smooth, flat undisturbed sediment surface) and sediment containing Austrovenus (gt; 150 ind. m- 2; physical structure on/in the sediment surface, increase in bed roughness). These results indicate that there is little or no effect of Austrovenus on the critical erosion threshold, suggesting that in the absence or presence of Austrovenus the current required to erode 10 g m- 2 of sediment would remain somewhere between 28. 5 and 30. 5 cm s- 1. This study found that there was considerable variation in the burial rate of individuals and the greatest variation was recorded in the lowest density treatments (150 ind. m- 2), which corresponded to the same density that had the greatest variation in sediment <b>erodability.</b> Further investigations are needed to gain a better understanding into the important roles (the importance of the various feedbacks and limitations and interrelationships) that Austrovenus play in the soft-sediment ecosystem, as losses of this species are likely to have large-scale impacts on the wider soft-sediment communities and ecosystem functioning...|$|E

It was decided not to include a measure of climate (because this is implicit in elevation) nor any measure of exposure to particular natural hazards (like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones) given that this is highly variable both spatially and temporally within the Pacific Basin and therefore more suited to a second-order layer of classification.|$|E

The tested muds cover Freshwater/Gypsum/Lignosulphonate mud and SeawaterlKCLlPolymer mud, bariteweighted and unweighted. The {{effects of the}} solid concentration, pressure and shear rate on the filter cake characteristics and the <b>erodability</b> were investigated. For static filtration experiments, all tests were conducted for two hours and the spurt loss, the filter cake thickness, the ratio of wet to dry cake mass and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured. For dynamic filtration experiments, however, only the spurt loss and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured and all tests were conducted for at least 8 hours. A general filtration equation was developed based on the cake filtration theory prevailing in the chemical engineering industry and it was utilised to obtain the modified classic static filtration equation and the dynamic filtration equation. The modified classic static filtration equation was then employed to fit the static filtration experimental data and the average specific static cake resistance and the effective filter medium resistance were calculated. The dynamic filtration equation showed a substantial agreement with the dynamic filtration experimental data. Using the static filter cake properties such as the ratio of wet to dry cake mass (m), the average specific dynamic cake resistance, the effective filter medium resistance and the dynamic filter cake <b>erodability</b> were calculated. In {{the study of the}} relationship between the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data, an attempt of predicting the dynamic filtration data from the static filtration experimental data was conducted. Also, an attempt was carried out to predict the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data in a sequential process.

Chemically, we have demonstrated that cements that hold grains of rocks together can be dissoluble by lichen byproducts in the presence of an aqueous environment whether the rocks are sandstone or granite. This information regarding the mechanical and geochemical processes at work in natural environments has significant practical benefit for the management, conservation, and preservation of rock art sites everywhere...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares modeled biotic and {{physical}} effects on intertidal sediment transport, using parameterizations {{that are based}} on laboratory and field experiments. A one-dimensional model of an intertidal transect is constructed. The model is aligned cross shore and includes movement of water and suspended sediment. Within the model, tidal currents cause erosion, and bioturbation by the clam, Macoma balthica, alters the <b>erodability</b> of the bed sediment. The concentration of chlorophyll a in the surface sediment (which is an indicator of microphytobenthos density) alters the critical erosion velocity. External sediment supply is specified as an offshore suspended matter concen-tration. The model is applied within Spurn Bight (Humber Estuary, UK). The effects of various tide heights, biota densities, and external suspended sediment concentrations are investigated. Offshore sediment supply dominates the net deposition below midtide level, but factors affecting intertidal sediment erosion and deposition become important at higher shore levels. Changes in erosion or deposition caused by natural variation in biota densities are as large as those caused by changes in tidal range and currents over a spring–neap cycle, or by doubling external supply. Seasonal variations in densities of stabilizing microphytobenthos can alter the magnitude of net deposition on the upper shore by a factor of two. Interannual variation in numbers of bioturbating clams can change net deposition by a factor of five. These results show that biotic influences on transport of sediment within the intertidal zone ar...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of biophysical interactions on short-term and long-term sediment dynamics. Therefore, various biological (macrobenthos, photopigments, colloidal EPS) and physical parameters (grain size, water content, sediment stability, bed level) were determined (bi) monthly in nine sampling plots on the IJzermonding tidal flat (Belgium, 51 ° 08 'N, 2 ° 44 'E) during three consecutive years (July 2005 –June 2008). Results showed that sediment stability varied on the short timescale and was directly influenced by biota, while bed level varied mainly on the long-term due to interannual variability. The short-term dynamic relationships between mud content, water content, fucoxanthin and macrobenthos density resulted in a seasonal mud deposition and erosion cycle, and directly influenced sediment stability. Moreover, macrobenthos was proven {{to be the most important}} parameter determining sediment stability. On the long-term, a shift was observed from high fucoxanthin/chl a concentration, high mud content and zero to moderate densities of Corophium volutator towards low fucoxanthin/chl a and mud content and high Corophium densities, which resulted in a transition from net accretion to net erosion. However, most measured variables proved to be poor predictors for these long-term bed level changes, indicating that external physical forces, such as waves and storminess, probably were the most important factors triggering long-term sediment dynamics. Nevertheless, biota indirectly influenced bed level changes by mediating short-term changes in sediment stability, thereby influencing the <b>erodability</b> of the sediment. The macrobenthos, and especially the mud shrimp Corophium, was suggested as the (indirect) driving destabilising factor for the sampling plots in the IIzermonding when considering the long-term evolution...|$|E
