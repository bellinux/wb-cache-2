5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their <b>holiday</b> <b>camp.</b> The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, the <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton {{following the}} withdrawal of this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead <b>holiday</b> <b>camp.</b> In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{remained}} {{close to}} his mother, both in following her to Canada and in arranging {{for her to come}} home {{after the death of his}} stepfather. She died in 1934 and never saw his first <b>holiday</b> <b>camp.</b> By contrast, Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada. Public records from South Africa show that his father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life, dying in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Butlins Skegness (officially Butlins Resort Skegness), {{formerly}} Butlin's Skegness or Funcoast World; is a <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> {{located in}} Ingoldmells near Skegness in Lincolnshire, England. Sir William Butlin conceived of its creation {{based on his}} experiences at a Canadian summer camp in his youth and by observation {{of the actions of}} other holiday accommodation providers, both in seaside resort lodging houses and in earlier smaller holiday camps.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a <b>holiday</b> <b>camp.</b> He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin {{toyed with the idea of}} providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1960 Butlin {{planned to}} open his <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> at Bognor, but because of {{flooding}} it was not ready. Butlin offered his patrons {{the chance to be}} re-sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp's construction. A number opted to stay and help, and received a free bottle of champagne as a reward. Once opened, the camp quickly became popular, accommodating around 5,000 campers and another 5,000 day visitors.|$|E

5|$|The camp {{included}} {{dining and}} recreation facilities, such as dance halls and sports fields. During World War II, {{the camp was}} subject to a short military occupation when it served as a Naval training base, reverting to being a <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> in 1946. Over the past 75 years the camp has seen continuous use and development, in the mid-1980s {{and again in the}} late 1990s being subject to substantial investment and redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, forty {{prefabricated}} {{houses were}} built on adjacent {{land on a}} former <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> to rehouse residents {{of some of the}} most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism.|$|E

5|$|However Butlin did {{not remain}} celebrating for long; he {{required}} a further $2.25 million (2011:£) {{to complete the}} camp, and {{to make matters worse}} American tourists were not used to the <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> mentality so the venture held little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.|$|E

Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon {{spending}} off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a <b>holiday</b> <b>camp</b> during {{the early days of}} British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's That'll Be the Day. He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, Stardust, and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of Tommy. Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's Sextette with Starr and Alice Cooper. This was the last film to star Mae West.|$|E

Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but {{said that he was}} not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them.|$|E
