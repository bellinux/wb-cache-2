50|$|Marius Nasta's research, {{carried out}} either by himself or in teams, covered the most {{important}} fields of phthisiology such as bacteriology, immunology and the physiophathology of respiratory diseases. In the field of tuberculosis, his research focused on the immunology of the disease, mycobacterium tuberculosis, vaccines (Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine or BCG) {{as well as on}} the detection, chemotherapy, pathology of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Nasta's research on experimental chemoprophylaxis and <b>immuno-prophylaxis</b> of tuberculosis was cutting edge. It enabled the introduction of specific and practical methods for the prevention of the disease throughout Romania. He also studied tuberculosis and bronchopathy in specific living and working environments and established a link between such environments and the proliferation of these diseases.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Development of the {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} and deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing techniques has enabled precise identification, classification and taxonomy of viruses. Comparative sequence analysis. Comparative sequence analysis methods {{can be used in}} medical virology for many practical purposes. They may be classified into three broad categories: I - reconstruction of genealogical relationships between individual viral isolates for detection and monitoring of sources, reservoirs and modes of viral transmission; II - virus genotyping, that is determination of relationships between genetic types of viruses and their phenotypic properties, which has important implications for <b>immuno-prophylaxis,</b> therapy and prognosis of viral diseases; and III -investigation of functional properties of defined viral sequences, of special importance for explanation of viral pathogenesis and design of antiviral drugs. Future prospects. The combination of DNA sequencing with {{polymerase chain reaction}} following reverse transcription with the use of random primers offers a universal means for diagnosis of viral infections. ...|$|E
40|$|Botulinum {{neurotoxins}} (BoNTs), etiological {{agents of}} the life threatening neuroparalytic disease botulism, are the most toxic substances currently known. The potential for the use as bioweapon makes the development of small-molecule inhibitor against these deadly toxins is a top priority. Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for BoNT intoxication. Although an effective vaccine/immunotherapy is available for <b>immuno-prophylaxis</b> but this cannot reverse the effects of toxin inside neurons. A small-molecule pharmacological intervention, especially one that would be effective against the light chain protease, would be highly desirable. Similarity search was carried out from ChemBridge and NSC libraries to the hit (7 -(phenyl(8 -quinolinylamino) methyl) - 8 -quinolinol; NSC 84096) to mine its analogs. Several hits obtained were screened for in silico inhibition using AutoDock 4. 1 and 19 new molecules selected based on binding energy and Ki. Among these, eleven quinolinol derivatives potently inhibited in vitro endopeptidase activity of botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain (rBoNT/A-LC) on synaptosomes isolated from rat brain which simulate the in vivo system. Five of these inhibitor molecules exhibited IC(50) values ranging from 3. 0 nM to 10. 0 µM. NSC 84087 is the most potent inhibitor reported so far, {{found to be a}} promising lead for therapeutic development, as it exhibits no toxicity, and is able to protect animals from pre and post challenge of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} 16 {{recognised}} herpesviruses that naturally infect cattle, sheep, goats and various species of deer and antelopes. Six of the viruses are recognised as distinct alphaherpesviruses and 9 as gammaherpesviruses. Buffalo herpesvirus (BflHV) and ovine herpesvirus- 1 (OvHV- 1) remain officially unclassified. The prevalence of ruminant herpesviruses varies from worldwide to geographically restricted in distribution. Viruses in both subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae cause mild to moderate and severe disease in respective natural or secondary ruminant hosts. Accordingly, the economic and ecological impact of the viruses is also variable. The molecular characteristics of some members have been investigated in detail. This {{has led to the}} identification of virulence-associated genes and construction of deletion mutants and recombinant viruses. Some of the latter have been developed as commercial vaccines. This paper aims to give an overview of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infection by these viruses, <b>immuno-prophylaxis</b> and mechanisms of recovery from infection. Since there are 128 ruminant species in the family Bovidae, it is likely that some herpesviruses remain undiscovered. We conclude that currently known ruminant alphaherpesviruses occur only in their natural hosts and do not cross stably into other ruminant species. By contrast, gammaherpesviruses have a much broader host range as evidenced by the fact that antibodies reactive to alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1 have been detected in 4 subfamilies in the family Bovidae, namely Alcelaphinae, Hippotraginae, Ovibovinae and Caprinae. New gammaherpesviruses within these subfamilies are likely to be discovered in the future...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Rabies is {{a deadly}} disease in which first aid and <b>immuno-prophylaxis</b> after animal bite {{play a vital}} role in prevention. Animal bites are usually more {{prevalent}} in rural areas and the first aid is sought most commonly from health workers in rural areas. The same is the case in Uttarakhand due to vast expanse of forests and rural area. In the present study, the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding prevention of this disease among a special group of people, i. e. health workers were assessed. Material and Methods : District Dehradun was selected as study area and all the health workers in the district (162 health workers, males and females both) were enumerated and interviewed. The data were collected by administering semi structured questionnaire to them. The knowledge was assessed by evolving a scoring system. Practices and attitudes were assessed based on their past experiences and their present willingness for proper management of a case of animal bite.   Results & Conclusion : Most of the study participants (59. 9 %) obtained a medium score (10 - 17) in knowledge regarding disease and its prevention. All of the participants had heard of the disease and knew about mode of spread. Most of the participants (83. 3 %) lack knowledge about anti-rabies immunoglobulin and pre-exposure prophylaxis (80. 2 %). Most of the participants (81. 4 %) had attitude scores in satisfactory range (2 - 3). Sixty percent had practice scores in low range (0 - 2). Though the knowledge regarding pet vaccination and full course of human vaccination was lacking in some, but the willingness to encourage pet owners to vaccinate their pets and encourage bite victims to get full course of vaccine was 100 %. There is a need for sensitization of health workers so that their knowledge can be enhanced and their positive attitude (100 % willingness) can be translated into proper practices for prevention and control of Rabies.   </p...|$|E
