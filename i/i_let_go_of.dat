500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

When it comes to that whole side, there's a back story that involves my group dealing with a case three years ago. I kind of reached a resolution with that. Coincidentally, the bunny tried to make another cameo appearance when we were filming the final investigation of the season, but we just told it to go to you-know-where. I hope it makes the cut!".|$|E

60|$|We must {{both have}} cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine was the shrill cry of terror, {{his was a}} roar of fury like a {{charging}} bully's.

60|$|He {{slipped out}} his knife, thrust the blade between the clenched {{teeth of the}} Russian, and turned it so as to force his mouth open.

From the way in which, half strangled as he was, he glanced at the paper I was sure that it was a message of extreme importance. His hands twitched as if he longed to snatch it from me. He shrugged his shoulders, however, and smiled good-humouredly when I apologised for my roughness.|$|E
60|$|Down I went, and I {{came right}} {{down on a}} small sea-fan, which I grabbed instantly. That ought to give way easily. But as I seized it, I brought down my right foot {{into the middle of}} a big round sponge. I started, as if I had had an {{electric}} shock. The thing seemed colder and wetter than the water; it was slimy and sticky and horrid. I did not see what it was, and it felt as if some great sucker-fish, with a cold woolly mouth, was trying to swallow my foot. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> everything, and came right up, and drew myself, puffing and blowing, on board the boat.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew one}} last rush of mad hunger for her. I sprang and seized her. I would horse her and ride {{away with her}} and my men into Syria away from this cursed city of folly. She struggled. I crushed her. She struck me on the face, and I {{continued}} to hold and crush her, for the blows were sweet. And there she ceased to struggle. She became cold and motionless, so that I {{knew there was no}} woman's love that my arms girdled. For me she was dead. Slowly <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> her. Slowly she stepped back. As if she did not see me she turned and went away across the quiet room, and without looking back passed through the hangings and was gone.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} time since the bushes had begun to pour forth Glossops, Bertram Wooster could be said to have breathed freely. I don't say I {{actually}} came out from behind the bench, but <b>I</b> did <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> it, and with something of the relief which those three chaps in the Old Testament must have experienced after sliding out of the burning fiery furnace, I even groped tentatively for my cigarette case.|$|R
60|$|At this triumphant moment I made {{a horrible}} discovery. About six {{feet from the}} leader the strands of the line had frayed, leaving only one thread intact. My blood ran cold and the clammy sweat broke out on my brow. My empire was not won; my first tarpon {{was as if he}} had never been. But true to my fishing instincts, I held on morosely; tenderly I handled him; with {{brooding}} care I riveted my eye on the frail place in my line, and gently, ever so gently, I began to lead the silver king shoreward. Every smallest move of his tail meant disaster to me, so when he moved it <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the reel. Then I would have to coax him to swim back again.|$|E
60|$|A small gray shark {{and a huge}} yellow shark {{were coming}} up with our quarry. R. C. said things, and pulled hard on the light tackle. I got hold of the leader and drew the {{sailfish}} close to the boat. He began to thresh, and the big shark came with a rush. Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the leader, which action was a blunder. The sailfish saw the shark and, waking up, he fought a good deal harder than before the sharks appeared upon the scene. He took off line, and got so far away that I gave up any hope that the sharks might not get him. There was a heavy commotion out in the water. The shark had made a rush. So had the sailfish, and he came {{right back to the}} boat. R. C. reeled in swiftly.|$|E

But he came at it once more, {{and this time he}} was careful. He got {{gradually}} higher and higher, and my spirits went down more and more. Up he came--an inch at a time--with his eyes hot, and his tongue hanging out. Higher and higher--hitched his foot over the stump of a limb, and looked up, as much as to say, 'You are my meat, friend.' Up again--higher and higher, and getting more excited the closer he got. He was within ten feet of me! I took a long breath,--and then said I, 'It is now or never.' I had the coil of the lariat all ready; I paid it out slowly, till it hung right over his head; all of a sudden <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the slack, and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck! Quicker than lightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face. It was an awful roar, and must have scared the bull out of his senses. When the smoke cleared away, there he was, dangling in the air, twenty foot from the ground, and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you could count! I didn't stop to count, anyhow--I shinned down the tree and shot for home." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{left the}} cab behind {{a bit of}} woods, {{not far from the}} school, and then I laid low, and pretty soon I seed 'em all coming out, in a double line, with the teacher behind 'em, for a walk. I had a {{description}} of the little gal as was wanted, and as they come nearer I made her out easy. She was the only real light-haired one in the lot. I hid behind some bushes {{in the side of the}} road, and when they come up, and the light-haired little gal was just opposite to me, I jumped out of the bushes and made a dash at her. Whoop! what a row there was in one second! Such a screamin' and screechin' of gals, such a pilin' on top each other, and the teacher on top the whole of 'em, bangin' with her umbrella; they pulled at the gal and they pulled at me, an' they yelled and they howled, and I never was in such a row and hope I never shall be again, and I grabbed that girl by her frock, and I tumbled some over one way and some another, and I got the umbrella over my head, but I didn't mind it, and I clapped that bag over the little gal, and I jerked, up her feet and let her slip into it, and then I took her up like a bag of meal, and put across the field, with the whole kit and boodle after me. But I guess most of 'em must have tumbled down in hysterics, judgin' from the screechin', and I got up to the cab and away we went. Well, when we got to the house where I was to meet the gent, he began straight off to blow at me. 'What do you mean,' he yelled, 'bringin' my daughter in a bag?'--'It's the only way to do it, sir,' says I; 'they can't holler and they can't kick, and people passin' by don't know what you've got,' and so sayin' I untied the strings, put the little gal on her feet, and pulled off the bag, and then I'd be hanged if I ever saw a man so ragin' mad as he was. 'What do I want with that gal?' he cried; 'that's not my daughter. That girl's hair is as black as a coal, and she's a Jew besides.' As soon as I sot my eyes on the little varmint it come over me that I got the thing crooked, and in the scrimmage <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the right gal and grabbed another.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{ten days}} {{or more of}} this I was worn out by loss of sleep. And one night, when tired out with watching, I fell asleep. My gun-bearer {{was alone in the}} tent with me. A terrible roar awakened me, then an unearthly scream pierced right into my ears. I always slept with my rifle in my hands, and, {{grasping}} it, I tried to rise. But I could not for the reason that a lion was standing over me. Then I lay still. The screams of my gun-bearer told me that the lion had him. I was fond of this fellow and wanted to save him. I thought it best, however, not to move while the lion stood over me. Suddenly he stepped, and I felt poor Luki's feet dragging across me. He screamed, 'Save me, master!' And instinctively I grasped at him and caught his foot. The lion walked out of the tent dragging me as I held to Luki's foot. The night was bright moonlight. I could see the lion distinctly. He was a huge, black-maned brute, and he held Luki by the shoulder. The poor lad kept screaming frightfully. The man-eater must have dragged me forty yards before he became aware of a double incumbrance to his progress. Then he halted and turned. By Jove! he made a devilish fierce object with his shaggy, massive head, his green-fire eyes, and his huge jaws holding Luki. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> Luki's foot and bethought myself of the gun. But as I lay there on my side, before attempting to rise, I made a horrible discovery. I did not have my rifle at all. I had Luki's iron spear, which he always had near him. My rifle had slipped out of the hollow of my arm, and when the lion awakened me, in my confusion I picked up Luki's spear instead. The bloody brute dropped Luki and uttered a roar that shook the ground. It was then I felt frightened. For an instant I was almost paralyzed. The lion meant to charge, and in one spring he could reach me. Under circumstances like those a man can think many things in little time. I knew to try to run would be fatal. I remembered how strangely lions had been known to act upon occasion. One had been frightened by an umbrella; one had been frightened by a blast from a cow-horn; another had been frightened by a native who in running from one lion ran right at the other which he had not seen. Accordingly, I wondered if I could frighten the lion that meant to leap at me. Acting upon wild impulse, I prodded him in the hind quarters with the spear. Ladies and gentlemen, I am a blooming idiot if that lion did not cower like a whipped dog, put his tail down, and begin to slink away. Quick to see my chance, I jumped up yelling, and made after him, prodding him again. He let out a bellow such as you could imagine would come from an outraged king of beasts. I prodded again, and then he loped off. I found Luki not badly hurt. In fact, he got well. But I've never forgotten that scare." ...|$|E
