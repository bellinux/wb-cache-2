5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined <b>information,</b> <b>support</b> for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran-Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E

Psychologically warfare chiefly {{involves the use of}} propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source. The CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD. The U.S. military used the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these were reclassified as Military <b>Information</b> <b>Support</b> Operations (MISO), part of Information Operations (IO). Psychologists are sometimes involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, though this has sometimes been denied by those involved and sometimes opposed by others.|$|E

5000|$|The {{possibility}} {{exists that}} the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but {{that the majority}} of information known to each member individually, supports {{the other side of the}} issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of <b>information</b> <b>supporting</b> job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of <b>information</b> <b>supporting</b> job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of <b>information</b> <b>supporting</b> candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more <b>information</b> <b>supporting</b> B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job.
