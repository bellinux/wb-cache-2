500|$|... "Man, {{there will}} be a time for Down. Matter of fact we had a meeting this past week, and I know Jimmy's gotta go do an Eyehategod tour in February. But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always <b>Down</b> <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following a sixth-place finish, Gordon {{said that}} drivers [...] "want to win {{when you have}} a car like we did today, but I'll take it again next week. We're excited about the {{opportunity}} to go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> (Homestead). Certainly <b>for</b> me, my final race. I can't think of anything sweeter than just having that opportunity to go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and battle <b>for</b> the championship and seeing what happens.‚Äù ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are two settees in the cabin. We {{can do on}} {{them very}} well. I think we can't do better than go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> at once, <b>for</b> {{we have had a}} long and tiring journey." ...|$|R
2500|$|The church {{tower of}} the Holy Ghost Mission (Roman Catholic) in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, is {{sometimes}} called [...] "Livingstone Tower" [...] as Livingstone's body was laid <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> one night before it was shipped to London.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{believed}} that the United States should be looking beyond the present situation in Iraq: [...] "whether we leave there under our own terms or not, it's {{still going to be}} a very dangerous world. If we leave there under bad circumstances, we're going to have a haven <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> terrorists. The whole area, I'm afraid, will become nuclearized." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial.

[...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble if I can help it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E

6000|$|... ("The {{truth is}} one {{ought to have}} been taught French. Now, I suppose, old Barfoot is talking to my mother. That's an odd affair to be sure. But I can't see Bonamy <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Damn London!") <b>for</b> the market carts were lumbering down the street.|$|R
5000|$|Bera also {{attended}} {{both as a}} spectator and a visitor at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

6000|$|... "My dear child, it's {{perfectly}} simple. This earl {{of yours}} {{has taken the}} thing off to his castle, like a brigand.
