40|$|Patients {{with limited}} English {{proficiency}} (LEP) experience poorer quality care and more adverse events in hospital. Consequently, there is interest {{in understanding the}} role of professional medical <b>interpreters</b> in efforts to improve patient safety. To describe the views of professional medical <b>interpreters</b> on {{their role in the}} delivery of safe patient care. Qualitative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews. 15 professional medical <b>interpreters</b> affiliated with the Healthcare Interpretation Network in Toronto, Canada. Participants' views on their role in patient safety were analyzed and organized into themes. Professional medical <b>interpreters</b> described being uniquely situated to identify and prevent adverse events involving patients with LEP by: 1) facilitating communication and enhancing patients' comprehension, 2) giving voice to patients, and 3) speaking up about safety concerns. Participants described a tension between 'speaking up' and interpreters' ethical imperative to remain impartial. <b>Interpreters</b> also highlighted several challenges, including 4) medical hierarchy and healthcare providers' limited knowledge of the role of <b>interpreters.</b> These challenges introduced safety issues if providers asked <b>interpreters</b> to act outside of their scope of practice. Our study found that professional medical <b>interpreters</b> view their work as integral to the delivery of safe care to patients with LEP. In order to effectively engage in patient safety efforts together, <b>interpreters</b> and providers require a mutual understanding of their roles. Team hierarchy and limited provider knowledge of the role of <b>interpreters</b> can introduce safety concerns. In addition, <b>interpreters</b> describe a tension between "speaking up" about patient safety and the need for <b>interpreters</b> to remain impartial when facilitating communication. Healthcare institutions, providers, and <b>interpreters</b> must engage in discussion on how to best to "speak up" and integrate <b>interpreters</b> into safety efforts. Importantly, the benefits of partnering with <b>interpreters</b> can only be realized when providers consistently use their services...|$|R
40|$|Objective To explore {{differences}} in perspectives of general practitioners, Turkish-Dutch migrant patients and family <b>interpreters</b> on interpreters’ role, power dynamics {{and trust in}} interpreted GP consultations. Methods 54 semi-structured in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} the three parties focusing on <b>interpreter’s</b> role, power and trust in <b>interpreters.</b> Results In line with family interpreters’ perspective, patients expected the <b>interpreters</b> to advocate on their behalf and felt empowered when they did so. GPs, on the contrary, felt annoyed and disempowered when the family <b>interpreters</b> performed the advocacy role. Family <b>interpreters</b> were trusted by patients for their fidelity, that is, patients assumed that family <b>interpreters</b> would act in their best interest. GPs, on the contrary, mistrusted family <b>interpreters</b> when they perceived dishonesty or a lack of competence. Conclusion Opposing views were found between GPs {{on the one hand and}} family <b>interpreters</b> and patients on the other hand on <b>interpreter’s</b> role, power dynamics and the different dimensions of trust. These opposing perspectives might lead to miscommunication and conflicts between the three interlocutors. Practice implications GPs should be educated to become aware of the difficulties of family interpreting, such as conflicting role expectations, and be trained to be able to call on professional <b>interpreters</b> when needed...|$|R
40|$|Although many Deaf {{and hard}} of hearing {{children}} access education through <b>interpreters,</b> research on educational <b>interpreters</b> is scant and has focused on inadequacies of under-qualified <b>interpreters</b> rather than examining {{exactly what it is}} that qualified <b>interpreters</b> do. To determine the skills and knowledge <b>interpreters</b> need to work in K- 12 schools, it is crucial to identify current practices of educational <b>interpreters.</b> For this research, three <b>interpreters</b> working in fifth and sixth grade classrooms at three school sites were videotaped and interviewed to explore what <b>interpreters</b> do {{in the course of their}} work, and to illuminate the factors that inform their decisions. This study reveals not only five primary tasks that <b>interpreters</b> perform, but describes in detail what <b>interpreters</b> do as they strive to optimize visual access, to facilitate the learning of language and content, and to cultivate opportunities for participation. Data indicate that even qualified <b>interpreters</b> are not always well- equipped to meet the essential needs of Deaf and {{hard of hearing}} students in K- 12 settings. Results of this study contribute to our understanding of the complexities of interpreters' decisions in light of multiple and competing demands. Findings highlight the need for further research and serve as a call to action to improve the educational experiences of mainstreamed student...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interpreters</b> in {{the public}} sector in Norway {{interpret}} in a variety of institutional encounters, and the <b>interpreters</b> evaluate the majority of these encounters as polite. However, some encounters are evaluated as impolite, and they pose challenges when it comes to interpreting impoliteness. This issue {{raises the question of whether}} <b>interpreters</b> should take a stance on their own evaluation of impoliteness and whether they should interfere in communication. In order to find out more about how <b>interpreters</b> cope with this challenge, in 2014 a survey was sent to all <b>interpreters</b> registered in the Norwegian Register of <b>Interpreters.</b> The survey data were analyzed within the theoretical framework of impoliteness theory using the notion of moral order as an explanatory tool in a close reading of interpreters’ answers. The analysis shows that <b>interpreters</b> reported using a variety of strategies for interpreting impoliteness, including omissions and downtoning. However, the <b>interpreters</b> also gave examples of individual strategies for coping with impoliteness, such as interrupting and postponing interpreting. These strategies border behavioral strategies and conflict with the Norwegian ethical guidelines for interpreting. In light of the ethical guidelines and actual practice, mapping and discussing different strategies used by <b>interpreters</b> might heighten interpreters’ and interpreter-users’ awareness of the role impoliteness can play in institutional interpreter– mediated encounters.   </div...|$|R
40|$|Background: Community <b>interpreters</b> are {{employed}} to work across multiple settings in the UK, including mental health services, to support individuals whose first {{language is not}} English. To date, little research {{attention has been paid}} to the emotional impact of mental health interpreting on community <b>interpreters.</b> Aims: The aim of this study is to develop an in-depth understanding of the emotional challenges of mental health interpreting and the coping strategies employed by community <b>interpreters</b> to overcome these challenges. It is hoped that this research will raise practitioners??? awareness and help guide health services to support <b>interpreters</b> better, to enable the highest standards of care for clients. Methodology: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight community <b>interpreters</b> working in mental health settings. The interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Four master themes emerged from analysis: ???Feeling for the client???, ???Relationships in Context???, ???Balancing the personal self and the professional self??? and ???You need to protect yourself???. These master themes, along with the subthemes contributing to them, are expanded in to a narrative account of <b>interpreters???</b> experiences. Conclusions: This study has underscored the need for increased provision of support for <b>interpreters,</b> as well as training for practitioners in working with <b>interpreters.</b> Guidance for improved working relationships between <b>interpreters,</b> practitioners and employing agencies is given...|$|R
