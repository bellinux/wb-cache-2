5|$|ENZO (Enzyme <b>Kinetics)</b> is a {{graphical}} interface {{tool for}} building kinetic models of enzyme catalyzed reactions. ENZO automatically generates the corresponding differential equations from a stipulated enzyme reaction scheme. These differential equations are processed by a numerical solver and a regression algorithm which fits the coefficients of differential equations to experimentally observed time course curves. ENZO allows rapid evaluation of rival reaction schemes {{and can be}} used for routine tests in enzyme <b>kinetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzyme <b>kinetics</b> is {{the study}} of the {{chemical}} reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme <b>kinetics,</b> the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's <b>kinetics</b> in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme <b>kinetics,</b> {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten <b>kinetics</b> (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten <b>kinetics).</b> Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been formed and no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state <b>kinetics.</b> Pre-steady-state <b>kinetics</b> is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme–substrate intermediates (such as ES or E*) until their steady-state concentrations are reached.|$|E
5|$|Most enzyme <b>kinetics</b> studies {{concentrate}} on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid <b>kinetics</b> when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential <b>kinetics.</b> During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential <b>kinetics.</b> This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow exponential decay functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, they follow first order <b>kinetics</b> with respect to inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme <b>kinetics</b> cannot prove which {{modes of}} {{catalysis}} {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state <b>kinetics</b> would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme <b>kinetics</b> is the {{investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme <b>kinetics,</b> which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten <b>kinetics.</b> The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E
5|$|Many antagonists are {{reversible}} antagonists that, {{like most}} agonists, will bind and unbind a receptor at rates determined by receptor-ligand <b>kinetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plasma frequency: The {{electron}} {{plasma frequency}} (measuring plasma oscillations of the electrons) is large compared to the electron-neutral collision frequency (measuring frequency of collisions between electrons and neutral particles). When this condition is valid, electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas <b>kinetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The major {{contribution}} of the Henri-Michaelis-Menten approach was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. The <b>kinetics</b> of many enzymes is adequately described by the simple Michaelis-Menten model, but all enzymes have internal motions that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction <b>kinetics.</b> This can be modeled by introducing several Michaelis-Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates, which is a mathematical extension of the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a new view of the <b>kinetics</b> and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme <b>kinetics,</b> which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} goal of measuring enzyme <b>kinetics</b> {{is to determine}} the chemical mechanism of an enzyme reaction, i.e., the sequence of chemical steps that transform substrate into product. The kinetic approaches discussed above will show at what rates intermediates are formed and inter-converted, but they cannot identify exactly what these intermediates are.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and <b>kinetics</b> of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme <b>kinetics</b> and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|Michaelis–Menten <b>kinetics</b> {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which is derived from the {{assumptions}} of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} enzyme <b>kinetics</b> is {{important}} for two basic reasons. Firstly, it helps explain how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, KM and Vmax, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control metabolism.|$|E

25|$|Chemical <b>kinetics,</b> {{also known}} as {{reaction}} <b>kinetics,</b> {{is the study of}} rates of chemical processes. Chemical <b>kinetics</b> includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, as well as the construction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|For many {{systems of}} {{physical}} and chemical <b>kinetics,</b> detailed balance provides sufficient conditions for the strict increase of entropy in isolated systems. For example, the famous Boltzmann H-theorem states that, according to the Boltzmann equation, the principle of detailed balance implies positivity of entropy production. The Boltzmann formula (1872) for entropy production in rarefied gas <b>kinetics</b> with detailed balance served as a prototype of many similar formulas for dissipation in mass action <b>kinetics</b> and generalized mass action <b>kinetics</b> with detailed balance.|$|E

In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme <b>kinetics,</b> a closed-form solution for the time course <b>kinetics</b> analysis of Michaelis–Menten <b>kinetics</b> is described in terms of the Lambert W function.|$|E

25|$|For {{reversible}} reactions, {{changes in}} the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or {{left side of the}} reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.
