40|$|The bearing matrix {{formulations}} {{proposed by}} Lim and Singh (1990) are extended {{to analyze the}} overall dynamics of a geared rotor system which includes a spur gear pair, shafts, rolling-element bearings, a motor, a load, a casing, and flexible or rigid mounts. For this purpose, discrete vibration models are developed and used to predict vibration transmission through the bearings and to investigate {{the effects of the}} bearing, casing, and mount dynamics on the dynamic characteristics of the internal rotating system. Analytical predictions show that the theory is capable of predicting the bearing and mount moment transmissibilities in addition to the force transmissibilities. The predicted flexural vibrations of the casing plate are in good agreement with measurements conducted on an experimental set-up that consisted of a high-precision beam and pinion, and four identical rolling element bearings contained in a <b>flexible</b> <b>casing</b> mounted rigidly on a massive foundation...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a gearbox is usually simulated with lumped parameter models. However, with this approach, {{it is difficult}} {{to take into account the}} flexibility ofthe components of the transmission system with sufficient accuracy. Moreover, in the case of light structures as in aircraft applications, the casing flexibility is not negligible and affects the whole transmission system. In this work, to overcome these limitations, the CMS (Component Modal Synthesis) technique was applied. A model of a sample transmission system with two shafts, two simplified gears and a <b>flexible</b> <b>casing</b> was modeled in a FEM environment. Afterwards, the condensed dynamical characteristics of the structure were exported into a MATLAB procedure to perform a transient analysis taking into account the non linear phenomena associated with the gear meshing (in particular the effect of the periodicity of the meshing stiffness). Virtual accelerometers measured the acceleration of some nodes and the virtual signals were processed applying standard diagnostic techniques. With this approach simulations of a virtual test bench for diagnostic applications were carried out, monitoring virtual accelerometer signals in case of a damaged tooth (i. e. incipient bending crack) and observing the effects due to the casing flexibility. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis on the virtual accelerometer location was performed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReducing the {{clearance}} between blade tips and casing {{is an important factor}} in increasing the performance of turbomachines such as turbofan engines. However, small clearances lead to more chances of rotor-stator contact, which can cause unstable vibrations. To improve the prediction of such contact-related phenomena, this paper proposes a model that includes potential contacts between the fan blade tips and their surrounding casing. This phenomenological model consists of a fully flexible bladed rotor and a <b>flexible</b> <b>casing.</b> The bladed rotor model is built according to the method developed by Lesaffre and based on the approximations used by Sinha [2]. The casing model is composed of an elastic ring with isotropic suspension. Two different contact formulations have been developed: a 3 D contact detection law, which incorporates 3 D model kinematics along with 3 D local geometry of the contact area, is compared to a simpler formulation. For both formulations, once {{the clearance}} has been consumed, contact forces are introduced with normal contact stiffness, and friction is considered using Coulomb’s Law. In an initial step, linear harmonic results serve to compare these contact formulations in their ability to detect contact. Next, the stability of balanced static solutions is studied and transient analyses are carried out to confirm the static results. Study results highlight the influence of 3 D kinematics and 3 D local geometry on both contact detection and the dynamic stability of the system subjected to blade-casing contact...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} fully flexible bladed rotor developed in the rotating frame. An energetic method is used to obtain the matrix equations of the dynamic behaviour of the system.

In the rotating frame, the eigenvalues ’ imaginary parts of the latter matrix equation give the Campbell diagram of the system and its stability can be analysed through its associated eigenvalues ’ real parts. The turbo machine casing is also modelled by an elastic ring in the rotating frame through an energetic method. Thus, the contact problem between the rotor and the stator can be treated as a static problem. Prior {{to the study of the}} complete problem of contact between the flexible blades of the rotor and the <b>flexible</b> <b>casing,</b> a simple model of an elastic ring having only one mode shape, excited by rotating loads is developed in the rotating frame too, in order to underline divergence instabilities and mode couplings.

The stable balanced static contact configurations of the structure are found as function of the rotational speed of the rotor. Finally, the results are compared to these of the simple model of rotating spring-masses on an elastic ring, showing good adequacy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aims {{to predict the}} dynamic {{stability}} of a turbofan engine submitted to light contacts between fan blades tips and their surrounding casing. The study {{is based on a}} hybrid model which introduces a simplified bladed wheel and a <b>flexible</b> suspended <b>casing</b> to a rotor-shaft model. Inertial coupling is considered between blades and shaft dofs and an elastic link is introduced between the shaft and the suspension dofs of the casing. A 3 D contact formulation has been implemented to recover accuracy in the contacts detection and the application of contact forces; it considers the 3 D model kinematic and introduces the local geometry of the contact area. The model behavior with blade-to-casing contacts is analyzed through two approaches: the first one assumes permanent contacts while the other one allows intermittent contacts. Good agreement is obtained between the two types of results. The results highlight the importance of couplings in the initiation of unstable phenomena and the relevance of the 3 D contact formulation in predicting the stability of the system...|$|R
40|$|A {{representative}} {{model of}} aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, shaft, <b>casing,</b> <b>flexible</b> support structure and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed {{in such a}} way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e. g. <b>flexible</b> support structure, <b>casing</b> etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books. MHBM is widely used to solve nonlinear problems in the frequency domain. The advantage of this combined methodology is shown in the comparison between test and simulation result...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, polymer-based flat {{heat pipes}} (PFHPs) with a {{thickness}} {{on the order}} of 1 mm have been successfully developed and tested. Liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) films with copper-filled thermal vias are employed as the case material. A copper micropillar/woven mesh hybrid wicking structure was de-signed and fabricated to promote evaporation/condensation heat transfer and the liquid supply to the evaporator of the PFHP. Water was selected as the working fluid because of its superior thermophysical properties. An experimental study was conducted to examine the PFHP performance. The test data demonstrated that the PFHP can operate with a heat flux of 11. 94 W/cm 2 and results in effective thermal conductivity ranging from 650 to 830 W/m · K, with the value varying with the input heat flux and the tilt angle. With the employment of <b>flexible</b> LCP as <b>casing</b> material, the PFHP could potentially be directly integrated into a printed circuit board or flexible circuits for thermal management of heat-generating components.
