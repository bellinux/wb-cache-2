500|$|Anthony Burgess, in Ninety-nine Novels, cited {{it as one}} of the 99 best {{novels in}} English since 1939. [...] "Fleming raised the {{standard}} of the popular story of espionage through <b>good</b> <b>writing</b> — a heightened journalistic style — {{and the creation of a}} government agent — James Bond, 007 — who is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures. A patriotic lecher with a tinge of Scottish puritanism in him, a gourmand and amateur of vodka martinis, a smoker of strong tobacco who does not lose his wind, he is pitted against impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs. Auric Goldfinger is the most extravagant of these. All this is, in some measure, a great joke, but Fleming's passion for plausibility, his own naval intelligence background, and a kind of sincere Manicheism, allied to journalistic efficiency in the management of his recit, make his work rather impressive. The James Bond films, after From Russia With Love, stress the fantastic and are inferior entertainment to the books. It is unwise to disparage the well-made popular. There was a time when Conan Doyle was ignored by the literary annalists even though Sherlock Holmes was evidently one of the great characters of fiction. We must beware of snobbishness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Free Family Portrait Studio" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V.

[...] He continued {{to say that the}} season made him have little interest in [...] "seeing anything further from Andy Bernard". Despite this, he complimented the Dwight subplot due to its slight connection to real human emotions. He ultimately gave the episode a C+. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that he hoped the new showrunner, following Paul Lieberstein, would undo the developments made in the finale, criticizing the season's run of Andy Bernard as manager and Nellie Bertram's character. He also wrote that he would only view the first handful of episodes, due to the new showrunner and the hope that the season would improve. Cindy White of IGN wrote that the episode [...] "hit all the marks" [...] as a season finale, and said she was happy that Sabre was finally gone from the series. She complimented the <b>good</b> <b>writing</b> and character moments, but criticized the possible return of Nellie and the handling of the Angela-Dwight storyline over the season.

A reviewer for Horn Book Review gave a positive review, praising the plot, characters, and writing. The reviewer stated that [...] "Hunter successfully weaves character, plot, and <b>good</b> <b>writing</b> into another readable story". Hilary Williamson, writing for BookLoons, gave Moonrise a positive review, calling it [...] "exciting" [...] and a [...] "gripping epic". A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the novel for mundane writing, easy-to-confuse names, {{and the use of the}} words [...] "meowed" [...] and [...] "mewed" [...] instead of [...] "said". The reviewer thought that the plot was [...] "marred by the same preciousness of its predecessor", but praised the plot for its [...] "enhanced complexity" [...] and suspenseful writing, saying that [...] "a small plot twist is refreshing and suspense builds steadily towards the final installment". [...] The novel has also been mentioned for containing [...] "magic, fantasy, and heroic adventure", and was recommended to fans of Harry Potter as possible reading material after that series' end. Moonrise reached The New York Times bestseller list for children's chapter books, holding the number two spot for two weeks. It was also ranked 121st on USA Todays bestseller list during the week of August 11, 2005.

500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that <b>good</b> <b>writing,</b> interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E
