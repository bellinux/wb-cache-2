A decision by the 2006 National Convention on December 30, 2006, has essentially upheld the Board's previous resolution, adding additional clarifications to the transitional process for the all-male chapters, including a timeline for completion of their transition to co-educational status by the 2008 National Convention, {{and the establishment of}} a committee consisting of active members and alumni to assist with the process.

In addition, Brothers from Zeta Theta chapter at Drexel University, Pi Chi Chapter at Duquesne University, and Psi Delta Chapter at the University of Maine at Machias have joined this new fraternity.|$|E
