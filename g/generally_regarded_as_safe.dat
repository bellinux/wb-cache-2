25|$|Radiographic {{examinations}} involve {{radiation exposure}} {{in the form}} of X-rays. Although barium ions are toxic, their use is <b>generally</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> because the small amounts of barium ions available in solution and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract are deemed to be negligible; however, isolated cases of barium encephalopathy have been described following absorption of barium from the intestinal tract. Constipation and abdominal pain may occur after barium meals. The formation of baroliths, which may need to be removed surgically, is a complication of the use of barium sulfate. Barium sulfate may cause serious peritoneal irritation. Leakage of Barium sulfate into the abdominal cavity may occur in people with duodenal ulcers or other perforations and may lead to peritonitis, adhesion, and granulomas; it is associated with a high mortality rate. Leakage of barium into the mediastinum or peritoneal cavity may lead to endotoxic shock, which is often fatal; as a result, the use of barium as a contrast agent is contraindicated when there is a suspicion or possibility of compromise of bowel wall integrity. Aspiration or inhalation of barium sulfate into the lungs during oral application can lead to serious respiratory complications leading to fatal aspiration pneumonia or asphyxiation. Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are rare but some additives contained in barium preparations may induce immune reactions. Complete gastrointestinal obstruction is also a contraindication for barium studies.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Pancreatic stents may {{be placed}} during {{therapeutic}} ERCP {{for a variety}} of indications. One such indication is to prophylax against the development of pancreatitis following sphincterotomy of the minor papilla in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Increasingly, endoscopists that perform pancreatic ERCP are placing small caliber (3 Fr), unflanged, single pigtail stents into the long axis of the pancreatic duct with the expectation that these stents will only stay in place for a few days and the majority will pass spontaneously on their own without the need for follow-up endoscopic retrieval. As such, these stents are <b>generally</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>safer</b> and associated with a lower rare of complication than larger (5 and 7 Fr), double flanged pancreatic stents. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 3 Fr stent that migrated proximally into the dorsal duct in a patient with recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Due to the small size of the patient's dorsal duct, it was difficult to pass appliances alongside the stent to facilitate retrieval and a variety of appliances were used before success was achieved. DISCUSSION: The medical literature contains series of proximally migrated larger caliber flanged, pancreatic stents but proximal migration of small caliber, unflanged, pigtail stents has not yet been reported. As the use of these small stents increases, we feel {{that it is important to}} highlight the potential for this complication and discuss how we successfully treated our patient...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction The Z-drugs, zaleplon, {{zopiclone}} and zolpidem, are short-acting hypnotics which act at {{the same}} receptor as the benzodiazepines, but seemingly without the potential for misuse {{and the development of}} dependence of the older benzodiazepines. However, with increased prescribing of Z-drugs, reports of misuse and possible dependence began to appear in the literature, particularly in people with a history of substance misuse and comorbid psychiatric illness. Here we report the case of a woman with a history of chronic zopiclone use and anorexia nervosa, admitted for alcohol detoxification. Case presentation A 31 -year old Caucasian British woman with a history of long-term zopiclone use and anorexia nervosa was admitted as an inpatient for a ten-day alcohol detoxification. Her weekly (four days out of seven) intake of alcohol was 180 units and her daily intake of zopiclone, 30 mg. Apart from a short period five years ago, she had been taking zopiclone for 13 years at daily doses of up to 90 mg. She admitted to using 'on top' of her prescribed medication, purchasing extra tablets from friends or receiving them gratis from her partner. After detoxification from alcohol and zopiclone, she was prescribed diazepam which she found ineffectual and voiced her intention of returning to zopiclone on leaving the hospital. Conclusion Zopiclone is <b>generally</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>safer</b> than benzodiazepines, however, this particular individual, who was using high doses of zopiclone over many years, may provide further evidence of a risk of dependency when this drug is prescribed for substance users with a comorbid psychiatric illness. </p...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{bacillus}} Calmette-Guérin (BCG) {{has served}} as the unique vaccine against tuberculosis and has <b>generally</b> been <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>safe.</b> However, a clinical strain labeled 3281 that was isolated from a TB patient was identified to be BCG. Via the combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and comparative genomic analysis, unique 3281 genetic characteristics were revealed. A region containing the dnaA and dnaN genes that is closely related to the initial chromosome replication was found to repeat three times on the BCG Pasteur-specific tandem duplication region DU 1. Due to the minimum number of epitopes in BCG strains, 3281 was inferred to have a high possibility for immune evasion. Additionally, variations in the virulence genes and predictions for potential virulence factors were analyzed. Overall, we report a pathogen that has never previously been thought to be pathogenic and initial insights that are focused on the genetic characteristics of virulent BCG...|$|R
