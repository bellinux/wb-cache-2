5|$|The Gardens are {{believed}} to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his History of Lambeth Parish conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 Curiosities of London states <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breauté, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens {{appears to have been a}} longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.|$|E

Ockham {{defended the}} {{principle}} of parsimony, which could already {{be seen in the}} works of his mentor Duns Scotus. His principle later became known as Occam's Razor and states that if there are various equally valid explanations <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> then the simplest one should be chosen. This became a foundation of what would {{come to be known as}} the scientific method and one of the pillars of reductionism in science. Ockham probably died of the Black Plague. Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme were his followers.|$|E
