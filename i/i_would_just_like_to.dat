Mezger gained the upper hand early, cutting Silva with several crisp {{combinations}} and outpointing Silva on the feet. However, he was ultimately knocked out at the 3:45 mark. Shortly before the knockout, Silva was catching the worse end of the punching exchanges and proceeded to throw an intentional, illegal headbutt to Mezger that eventually led to landing the knockout combination. Many people felt as though this was a cheap shot that affected the end result. Some people, including Kazushi Sakuraba, felt the bout should have been changed to a no contest. Mezger talked about his feelings on the matter in an interview: [...] "I am not going to cry foul, it is the fight game and things like that happen, get used to it.

I was however a bit concerned about the text, specifically the reference to 'devil daughters'. I said, 'As much as I love this song, I really can't sing it for that reason.' Peter Mensch offered to contact Cedric Bixler-Zavala and asked if the text could be changed, since the overall meaning of the song wasn't completely clear anyway. Cedric responded, [...] "Sure, she can change it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> it to be known that in no way is the lyric supposed to paint women in a bad light...

40|$|In this paper, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like {{to outline}} some {{considerations}} on pricing {{in the nuclear}} fuel cycle market {{in the light of}} its future development. Many of you in this audience have years of experience in th s market, so I will not take your time talking about the economic theory of pricing. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>just</b> to present KAZATOMPROM's view on the question of pricing in the uranium market. If our previous report was comprised exclusively of facts verification, in this one we would like to put some rhetorical questions. For a start, we would like to ask: · Who in this auditorium is interested in uncertainty of prices for natural uranium? We think nobody, except, perhaps, some marketing specialists who like to read the tea-leaves. · Who in this room is interested in stable and predictable prices for natural uranium? We think all of us. If you agree with our answers to these rhetorical questions, let us ask some particularly practical ones. · Why is the spot volumes sale price considered as the main uranium market price indicator? · Why are the long-term contract prices guided by it? · Why is only TradeTech's indicator related to the long-term price from all published ones, and the rest – to the spot price? During the transition to a free nuclear fuel market, utilities must compete with alternative energy sources, where the fuel price forecasts are more or less reliable, and both the cost of fuel and kilowatts of energy are easily calculated with a certain level of accuracy. For nuclear power and the entire nuclear industry to compete successfully with other energy sources, nuclear utilities must have clear economic policies, and the uranium producing industry must be optimally streamlined. For this purpose, it is necessary to ensure that the forecasts are reliable and the production cost of uranium is properly understood...|$|R
40|$|History of {{architecture}} as composition – History {{of architecture}} as disposition Is there a pertinent criticism? Historiography changes depending of the (unknown) field of thoughts where the historian or the art critic stays… In this paper <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to present a}} difference between -	a Historiography and Criticism in a history of architecture as com-position of figures resulting in architectural objects and -	a Historiography and Criticism of architecture as dis-position of matters resulting in a architectural operation. and suggest a question: which historiography or which criticism is pertinent ? and develop synthetically what are the results of not making clear in which type of Historiography and Criticism we are ? The synthesis of this statement, which I could develop in my full paper is here: Historiography can stay {{in a field of}} thoughts considering that the anthrope –the so called Human Being- is ‘a priori there’, is ‘finite’, is central to itself, is capable on his own judgments or is a Cartesian subject. But Science to-day contradicts this thoroughly. For Science the subject isn’t anymore the Cartesian subject. For Science the subject isn’t central to itself. For Science the subject is the crossing of the others… He is limited but in-finite. For Science the subject isn’t com-posed as a Cartesian subject but is dis-posed towards the Real. For the Cartesian Subject, the architectural space was finite made by a finite com-posed architecture in a mental world of de-finition: An architecture of com-position of figures, as a sort of concept of and in the Reality. For the Subject, as Science presents it today, the architectural space is in-finite made by a in-finite architecture in a mental world of in-finition: An architecture of dis-position of matters, as an operation on the Real. And this doesn’t mean that the subject changed of structure…. For Science it was already so in the past. So the question ‘Which criticism of architecture is pertinent?’ & ‘Which historiography is pertinent?’ is a real question. In fact there is a Story of criticism… To criticize architecture as a com-position of a finite object isn’t so pertinent anymore… To criticize architecture as a dis-position of matter(s) in an in-finite operation is the work which still has to be done. Both of this type of critics are the results of an ideology. -	An old one based on a believe making of the anthrope a Cartesian subject finite and a priori present who wants an architecture and an architectural space as objects. -	A new one based on a knowledge of the results of Science showing the Subject limited but in-finite and evolving as the crossing of the others, and living in an architecture and an architectural space which are operations. The synthesis of this was presented by Louis Kahn in a lightning statement: Purity lies in the incompletion.
