50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, 1815-1880s, {{a series of}} {{technical}} innovations revolutionized the newspaper industry, and made possible mass production of cheap copies for a mass national readership. The telegraph arrived in 1845, and, about 1870, the rotary press developed by Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni. Previously, publishers used expensive rag paper and slow <b>hand-operated</b> <b>screw</b> <b>presses.</b> Now they used much cheaper wood pulp paper, on high-speed presses. The cost of production fell by an order of magnitude. The opening of the railway system in the 1860s that rapid distribution was possible between Paris and all the outline cities and provinces. As result of the technical revolution, much greater quantities of news was distributed much faster, and more cheaply. In June 1836 La Presse became the first French newspaper to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability; other titles soon copied the formula.|$|R

The problems associated with the single screw expeller is that, it requires three or more passes to expel oil from seeds, which increases the production time and are also less efficient.

The study was considered as a 4 Ã 3 Ã 3 factorial experiment with four levels of heating temperatures (80, 90, 100 and 110 0 C), three levels of moisture content (7, 8,and 9 %wb) and in three replications using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with moisture content as a blocking factor. The results of the evaluation shows that extraction efficiency increases with increase in temperature but tends to decrease as the temperature increased beyond 100 0 C in both samples. Also, the higher the moisture content of cashew kernel, the higher the extraction efficiency. But in the case of groundnut seed, extraction efficiency of the <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> decreases with increase in moisture content.
