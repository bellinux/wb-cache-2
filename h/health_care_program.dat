5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>program.</b> Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

Massachusetts and New Jersey have programs where the state will {{pay for health care}} when the patient cannot afford to do so. The City and County of San Francisco is also implementing a citywide <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>program</b> for all uninsured residents, limited to those whose incomes and net worth are below an eligibility threshold. Some cities and counties operate or provide subsidies to private facilities open to all regardless of the ability to pay. Means testing is applied, and some patients of limited means may be charged for the services they use.|$|E

During his U.S. Senate campaign, Miller, who had said federal entitlement programs are unconstitutional, was criticized for having received federal assistance from Medicaid and a federally funded Alaska <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>program</b> for low income families at this time of his life. His campaign responded that Miller had not received the aid since 2002. Miller said he did not oppose the state program itself, but did oppose its expansion.

25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>program</b> {{was not lost on}} the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 cents on the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E

On the issue of taxes, Bradley trumpeted his sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which had significantly cut tax rates while abolishing dozens of loopholes. He voiced his belief that the best possible tax code would be one with low rates and no loopholes, but he refused to rule out the idea of raising taxes to pay for his <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>program,</b> calling the idea of such a pledge [...] "dishonest".|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the central}} role of the {{threshold}} incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), or lambda ([lambda]), in the methods and application of cost-effective analysis (CEA), little attention has been given to the determining the value of [lambda]. In this paper we consider 'what explains the silence of the [lambda]'? The concept of the threshold ICER is critically appraised. We show that there is 'silence of the [lambda]' with respect to justification of the value of ICER thresholds, their use in decision-making and their relationship to the opportunity cost of marginal resources. Moreover, the 'sound of silence' extends to both 'automatic cut-off' and more sophisticated approaches to the use of [lambda] in determining recommendations about <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>programs.</b> We argue that the threshold value provides no useful information for determining the efficiency of using available resources to support new <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>programs.</b> On the contrary, the threshold approach has lead to decisions that resulted in increased expenditures on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> and concerns about the sustainability of public funding for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> without any evidence of increases in total health gains. To improve efficiency in resource allocation, decision-makers need information about the opportunity costs of programs.
