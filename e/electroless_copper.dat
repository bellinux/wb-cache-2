40|$|A thin copper {{layer is}} an {{integral}} part of a Through-Silicon via (TSV) structure. The copper layer experiences mechanical stressing through the temperature excursion, thus raising reliability concern of the component. Such reliability assessment calls for the determination of the mechanical properties of the thin layer. In this respect, this paper discusses the experimental study to establish the loading rate-dependent behavior of the Cu layer deposited on SiO 2 -coated Si substrate. A series of nanoindentation tests are performed on sputtered and <b>electroless</b> plated <b>copper</b> layer. The tests cover a range of probe displacement rates from 80 - 400 nm/s and indentation depths up to 400 nm. Load-displacement (depth) data pairs are recorded for each test. Results show that an indentation depth of 3 % of the Cu layer thickness is sufficient to eliminate the effect of surface morphology on the indentation load-displacement response. The load-displacement response of the <b>electroless</b> plated <b>copper</b> layer significantly decreases with the test speed, while a minor increase in similar effect is observed for the sputtered layer...|$|R

50|$|Techniques for {{metallization}} {{started as}} early as mirror making. In 1835, Justus von Liebig discovered the process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver, making the glass mirror {{one of the earliest}} items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of ABS plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical conductor, the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot chromic acid-sulfuric acid mixture. The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in tin(II) chloride solution, then palladium chloride solution. The processed surface is then coated with <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6 kgf/cm or 10 to 60 N/cm or 5 to 35 lbf/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal adhesion strength.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electroless</b> <b>Copper</b> plating is a {{critical}} process in printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture where it is employed to make the through holes and vias of a PCB conductive for subsequent electroplating. The most important pre-treatment step before <b>Electroless</b> <b>Copper</b> plating is the catalyst solution where palladium is deposited {{on the surface of}} the substrate to initiate the plating reaction.

40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} if copper nanoparticles could be utilized for two types of through hole plating in printed circuit boards, namely: as a catalytic material to initiate the <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> deposition process; and as a âconductiveâ layer which is coherent and conductive enough to allow âdirectâ electroplating of the through hole. The employment of nanoparticles means that an effective method of dispersion is required and this paper studies the use of mechanical agitation and ultrasound for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach â The paper utilized drilled, copper clad FR 4 laminate. The through holes were functionalized using a commercially available âconditionerâ before being immersed in a solution of copper nanoparticles which were dispersed using either a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound (40 kHz). When the copper nanoparticles were utilized as a catalytic material for <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> plating, the efficacy of the technique was assessed using a standard âbacklightâ test which allowed the plating coverage of the through holes to be determined. As a control, a standard palladium catalysed <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> process was employed. The morphology of the <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> deposits was also analysed using scanning electron microscopy. In the âdirect plateâ approach, after immersion in the copper nanoparticle dispersion, the through holes were electroplated at 3 [*]Admâ 2 for 15 [*]min, sectioned and examined using an optical microscope. The distance that the copper electroplate had penetrated down the through hole was then determined. Findings â The paper has shown that copper nanoparticles can be used as a catalytic material for <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> plating. The coverage of the <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> in the through hole improves as the copper nanoparticle concentration increases and, at the highest copper nanoparticle concentrations employed, good, but not complete, <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> coverage is obtained. Dispersion of the copper nanoparticles using ultrasound is critical to the process. Ultrasonically dispersed copper nanoparticles achieve some limited success as a conductive layer for âdirectâ electroplating with some penetration of the electroplated deposit into the through hole. However, if mechanical agitation is employed to mix the nanoparticles, no through hole plating obtaines. Originality/value â The paper has demonstrated the âproof of conceptâ that copper nanoparticles can be utilized to catalyse the <b>electroless</b> <b>copper</b> process, as well as their potential to replace costly palladiumâbased activators.
