Moreover, colloidal silica possesses better performance on environmental protection and production cost control.

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} titanium and titanium alloys castings is a difficult and expensive task. The main reasons for that are: the high melting point; the extremely high reactivity of titanium alloys against {{a large amount of}} elements (solid, liquids and gaseous) at high temperatures, with particular emphasis to oxygen. For this reason, traditional casting techniques and materials cannot be used, both for the melting and the moulding operations, and melting and pouring have to be performed under vacuum or inert gas. However, such demands are extremely important factors to the high cost of titanium castings, and one possible way to decrease it might be the use of traditional casting techniques, with slight changes both on materials and production equipments and procedures. This paper describes the production technique of TiAl castings, using a multi-layered refractory crucible based on stabilized zirconia, and pouring in different refractory <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> <b>shells.</b> Microhardness and residual elements concentration profiles, from the surface to the inside of castings, characterization of the metal-mould interface, and surface finish of samples will be presented and discussed, and results compared with the available bibliographic references, for this kind of allo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> {{process has}} been a widely used process for centuries. It {{is known for its}} ability to produce {{components}} of complex shapes with dimensional accuracy and excellent surface finish. <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> has been used to make manufacture weapons, jewellery and art castings during the ancient civilization and today it is used to manufacture engineering components. In <b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> wax patterns are made by wax injection and then coating of the wax patterns are done by ceramic slurry, made with silica flour and binder.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{titanium}} alloys {{were found to be}} valuable engineering materials for many different applications. Formerly used in critical applications like aerospace, aeronautic and military equipment, where the factor cost is not relevant, titanium alloys are finding now new and different markets. However, the development of such new markets will depend on an effective cost reduction of titanium parts, in order to achieve a selling cost suitable with its application in consumer goods. A possible solution to decrease production costs might be the use of traditional casting techniques to produce near net shape functional parts. During the last years, the authors have developed extensive research work on this field, and a new technique both for melting and moulding, using ceramic multi-layered crucibles and <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> <b>shells</b> was developed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was to tailor a colloidal processing technique called electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for use within the <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> <b>shell</b> formation process, where the EPD coating procedure {{would be used to}} form the primary ceramic coating on the melt-out substrate. EPD takes place due to the presence of an electric field within the suspension medium, which attracts charged particles in the suspension towards an electrode of opposite charge, onto which they are deposited. For the complex structures created using <b>investment</b> <b>casting,</b> the die cast patterns used as the substrate for the ceramic have to be easily removed, and so substrates materials that can either be melted or dissolved out the material to leave the hollow ceramic shell used. To implement EPD into the <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> process, this substrate needed to be conducting, and so conducting particle-filled <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> waxes were created and analysed. Carbon black and graphite filler were incorporated into waxes, and the conductivity and rheology of the resultant composites were studied, to gauge their suitability as an <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> pattern material. On the basis of both cost and for environmental reasons, the use of aqueous suspension media for EPD was preferred over the more commonly used organic systems. EPD was carried out using zircon in aqueous suspension, and the low particle concentration suspensions were stabilised through pH modification and anionic dispersant addition. The effect of suspension parameters and EPD set-up parameters on the coatings formed on compressed graphite electrodes and conductive wax electrodes were studied, through yield measurements and cross sectional analysis using scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

Using a green standard shell (Group 1), a partially fired standard shell (Group 2), and a green shell with a different third coat (Group 3), we verified that the fixture can measure differences in strength between sample groups. We attached steel buttons to leveled samples with 0. 05 mL of Hysol-Loctite 9340 epoxy, let it cure for 48 hours, and tested them at 0. 05 in. /min. Most shells failed below the face coat, instead of spalling. Groups 1 and 2 failed in a backup layer, or at the larger stucco beneath it (0. 035 - 0. 044 ″ deep). Group 3 failed in the face coat (0. 010 ″), flat in a backup layer (0. 033 ″), or in rounded craters through several layers (0. 064 ″). We measured fracture areas in Photoshop to calculate failure stresses, which averaged 116. 21 psi for Group 1, 179. 42 psi for Group 2, and 141. 99 psi for Group 3, with respective standard deviations of 21. 78 psi, 30. 84 psi, and 31. 21 psi.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{improvements in}} metal casting processes by reducing scrap {{and reducing the}} cost of production, due to scrap reduction from <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> and yield improvement offered by lost foam casting as compared to no-bake or green sand molding. The objectives for the <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> portion of the subtask are to improve knowledge of fracture toughness of mold shells and the sources of strength limiting flaws and to understand the effects of wax reclamation procedures on wax properties. Applying 'clean steel' approaches to pouring technology and cleanliness in <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> of steel are anticipated to improve incoming materials inspection procedures as they affect the microstructure and toughness of the shell. This project focused on two areas of study {{in the production of}} steel castings to reduce scrap and save energy: (1) Reducing the amount of <b>shell</b> cracking in <b>investment</b> <b>cast</b> steel production; (2) Investigate the potential of lost foam steel casting The basic findings regarding <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> <b>shell</b> cracking were: (1) In the case of post pouring cracking, this could be related to phase changes in silica upon cooling and could be delayed by pouring arrangement strategies that maintained the shell surface at temperature for longer time. Employing this delay resulted in less adherent oxidation of castings since the casting was cooler at the time o fair exposure. (2) A model for heat transfer through water saturated shell materials under steam pressure was developed. (3) Initial modeling result of autoclave de-waxing indicated the higher pressure and temperature in the autoclave would impose a steeper temperature gradient on the wax pattern, causing some melt flow prior to bulk expansion and decreasing the stress on the green shell. Basic findings regarding lost foam casting of steel at atmospheric pressure: (1) EPS foam generally decomposes by the collapse mode in steel casting. (2) There is an accumulation of carbon pick-up {{at the end of the}} casting opposite the gate. (3) It is recommended that lost foam castings in steel be gated for a quiescent fill in an empty cavity mold to prevent foam occlusion defects from the collapse mode. The energy benefit is primarily in yield savings and lower casting weight per function due to elimination of draft and parting lines for the larger lost foam castings. For the smaller <b>investment</b> <b>casting,</b> scrap losses due to shell cracking will be reduced. Both of these effects will reduce the metal melted per good ton of castings. There will also be less machine stock required per casting which is a yield savings and a small additional energy savings in machining. Downstream savings will come from heavy truck and railroad applications. Application of these processes to heavy truck castings will lighten the heavy truck fleet by about ten pounds per truck. Using ten years to achieve full penetration of the truck fleet at linear rate this will result in a fuel savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|R
