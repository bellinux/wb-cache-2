[...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> back – we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

At that day's session of parliament, Račić and fellow Serbian radical Toma Popović shouted: [...] "Heads are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> here and until someone kills Stjepan Radić there can be no peace." [...] The atmosphere that day prompted Radić to remark that [...] "a psychological mood for murder" [...] was being created. Several individuals in Serbia had made death threats against Radić in the preceding days. The Croatian People's Party ( [...] , HPS), which stood opposed to Radić's anti-Clericalism and pan-Slavic ideas, also called for his removal from public life. Serbian newspapers such as Politika (Politics), Samouprava (Self-administration) and Jedinstvo (Unity) demonized Croat politicians, including Radić, and called for their murder.|$|E

50|$|The memento {{pattern is}} {{implemented}} with three objects: the originator, a caretaker and a memento. The originator is some object {{that has an}} internal state. The caretaker is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do something to the originator, but {{wants to be able}} to undo the change. The caretaker first asks the originator for a memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations) it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>To</b> <b>roll</b> back <b>to</b> the state before the operations, it returns the memento object to the originator. The memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change). When using this pattern, care should be taken if the originator may change other objects or resources - the memento pattern operates on a single object.|$|R
2500|$|Given that Alexander Cockburn was {{perceived}} as a British leftist (even though he was an Irish citizen) living in the US he was often compared to Christopher Hitchens {{who had been a}} Trotskyist in Britain. The two of them were close friends in the 1980s as Hitchens had just arrived and Cockburn had been in the country for a decade already and was well situated to give Hitchens advice. They would meet regularly in Greenwich Village. Robin Blackburn remarked [...] "Alexander sort of invented Christopher. He showed him what could be done." [...] Along with Ben Sonnenberg Cockburn became co-godfather to Christopher's son Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens. Reciprocally, Christopher Hitchens was godfather to Henry Cockburn, the son of Patrick Cockburn and Alexander Cockburn's nephew. Nevertheless, there were ideological differences which opened up between them early on. Cockburn would later note that Hitchens [...] "wrote some really awful stuff in the early 90s about how indigenous peoples — Indians in the Americas — were inevitably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> over by the wheels of Progress and should not be mourned." ...|$|R

40|$|When admitting {{electronic}} media {{as a means}} for citizens to approach public authorities – i. e., when advancing official proceedings towards e-Government – security is an indispensable precondition for concerns of legal certainty and for achieving acceptance by the citizens. While the security-enabling technologies such as smartcards, digital signatures, and PKI are mature, questions of scalability, technology-neutrality, and forwardcompatibility arise when being deployed on the large scale, such as when being deployed nation-wide. In this paper the security architecture followed with the Austrian citizen card is presented. This dedicated concept where smart-cards are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> out <b>to</b> every Austrian citizen will establish the citizen’s security infrastructure to utilize emerging e-Government applications. We briefly present the legal provisions that enable e-Government. We than reflect on requirements to be fulfilled to achieve a lasting security architecture that provides swift deployment of applications, but provides the flexibility to not discriminate against service providers and technologies that will emerge in future. The concept called “security layer ” is discussed as the core part of the security architecture, which basically is an open interface that hides the security-relevant functionality of the citizen card on a high abstraction level. A few e-Government applications that are being launched in the short-term are sketched to give a touch of the variety of requirements covered in the architecture. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} Japanese International Relations {{in the last}} quarter of the 20 th century, highlighting the history of IR academic development and the opportunities and constraints posed by the International System. It demonstrates that Japanese approaches to IR varied in strength and representativeness, despite the co-existence of four strands of thought:Staatslehre, Historicist, Marxist and American Style. The lack of integration between these approaches and in methodological refining can be held accountable for the absence of a stricto sensubumiputra(autochthonous) Japanese theory of IR. The 1997 Asian Crisis was a fracture point in Japanese scholarly debate as it represented the ultimate failure of theGankou Keitairon (Flying Geese) paradigm, pertaining to the until-then highly reputed Staatslehre strand of thought. This effectively yielded towards a greater popularization of the American style approach and evidence suggests that such strand gained more and more adepts as years went by. Being heavily influenced by international events, however, it is difficult to predict how Japanese IR will develop in the future. To be sure, there are simply too many variables in Japanese regional and global political and economic environments for one to tell for sure if the American style approach will continue gaining adepts or if it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> back and lose ground. International challenges, especially in the case of Japan, might produce unpredictable results, as to the academic debate in the field of IR...|$|R
