A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E

The percentages of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).|$|E

He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs,</b> rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs,</b> with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

40|$|Currently, rising <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> is an {{important}} topic on many agendas and platforms. In 2007, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> spending in the United States reached $ 2. 3 trillion, and was projected to reach $ 3 trillion in 2011 (NCHC, 2007). Increasing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> is in direct relationship with {{the rise in the}} ageing population, chronic illness, and the uninsured lower socioeconomic population as well. The research on medical compliance and attendance (missed/kept appointment) behavior is {{an important}} area to explore because it is critical for all aspects of successful treatment, disease prevention, and health promotions that have direct correlation with <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> (Winnick et al., 2004).

25|$|Overall <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> were {{projected}} in 2011 {{to increase}} by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, {{in part because of}} increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers. Over the next decade, Medicare’s per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance’s 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> is essential to the nation’s fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.|$|E

Objective: The overall {{purpose of this study}} was to describe and estimate cancer disparities in HCC treatments and cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation (LT) and resection treatment by race/ethnicity in the Medicare population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HCC patients (age 3 ̆e= 65) through the SEER-Medicare linked database in 2000 - 2009. We measured the difference in HCC treatment utilization by race/ethnicity groups. We addressed the differences in utilization by using decomposition analysis to examine differences in patients at risk, environment, and delivery system characteristics among race/ethnicity groups.
