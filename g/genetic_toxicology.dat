40|$|Zebrafish testis {{has become}} a {{powerful}} model for reproductive biology of teleostean fishes and other vertebrates and encompasses multiple applications in applied and basic research. Many {{studies have focused on}} 2 D images, which is time consuming and implies extrapolation of results. Three-dimensional imaging of whole organs recently became an important challenge to better understand their architecture and allow cell enumeration. Several protocols have thus been developed to enhance sample transparency, a limiting step for imaging large biological samples. However, none of these methods has been applied to the zebrafish testis. We tested five clearing protocols to determine if some of them could be applied with only small modifications to the testis. We compared clearing efficiency at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. CUBIC and PACT were suitable for an efficient transparency, an optimal optical penetration, the GFP fluorescence preservation and avoiding meaningful tissue deformation. Finally, we succeeded in whole testis 3 D capture at a cellular resolution with both CUBIC and PACT, which will be valuable in a standard workflow to investigate the 3 D architecture of the testis and its cellular content.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} environmental toxicology {{is that many}} genetic and genomic tools available in laboratory models are not developed for commonly used environmental models. The Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) {{is one of the}} most studied teleost environmental models, yet few genetic or genomic tools have been developed for use in this species. The advancement of <b>genetic</b> and evolutionary <b>toxicology</b> will require that many of the tools developed in laboratory models be transferred into species more applicable to environmental toxicology. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) gene knockdown technology has been widely utilized to study development in zebrafish and has been proven to be a powerful tool in toxicological investigations through direct manipulation of molecular pathways. To expand the utility of killifish as an environmental model, MO gene knockdown technology was adapted for use in Fundulus. Morpholino microinjection methods were altered to overcome the significant differences between these two species. Morpholino efficacy and functional duration were evaluated with molecular and phenotypic methods. A cytochrome P 450 - 1 A (CYP 1 A) MO was used to confirm effectiveness of the methodology. For CYP 1 A MO-injected embryos, a 70 % reduction in CYP 1 A activity, a 86 % reduction in total CYP 1 A protein, a significant increase in beta-naphthoflavone-induced teratogenicity, and estimates of functional duration (50 % reduction in activity 10 dpf, and 86 % reduction in total protein 12 dpf) conclusively demonstrated that MO technologies can be used effectively in killifish and will likely be just as informative as they have been in zebrafish...|$|R
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} {{is rapidly}} becoming a vital tool {{in studies of}} genetic disease. Use of the zebrafish embryo as an experimental model combines the efficiency of techniques specific to invertebrates with the human applicability of vertebrate studies, along {{with a number of}} other advantages such as optical transparency and high spawn number. Sequencing maps and mutant screen data are available, and gene ontology annotation is progressing. Furthermore, a number of highly important projects are underway to expand the utility of the zebrafish still further (eg. Mutant screens and TILLING projects; see (Lieschke and Currie, 2007) for review). As such the zebrafish has become a vital model organism for study of a variety of <b>genetic</b> defects, <b>toxicology</b> and pharmacological screens etc. These papers trace the development of zebrafish embryos as a model organism for both genetic disease and, as part of this, the development of a relatively high throughput approach to analysing relative levels of apoptosis. The first paper describes the fmr 1 gene family in zebrafish (fmr 1, and its orthologs fxr 1 and fxr 2). This paper includes a phylogenetic analysis of the gene family that demonstrates the high conservation between human and zebrafish, in the context of Drosophila. We then describe expression of the genes in the embryo (using in situ hybridisation) and adult (using real time pcr). The conclusions are that the zebrafish is an appropriate model in which to study Fragile X Mental Retardation genetic disease. The second paper builds upon this conclusion and further establishes the appropriateness of the model by recapitulating elements of the disease that had already been modelled in other model organisms. The research is validated using a number of controls. We describe a number of original findings that extended the body of knowledge regarding pharmacological rescue of the FMRP loss phenotypes. A craniofacial phenotype is identified, the first such discovery in a model of Fragile X syndrome. These findings are a vital step toward understanding the pathway from gene, to molecular phenotype, to cellular morphology, to gross morphology. As part of these studies, we found it necessary to analyse apoptosis. The technique developed to facilitate this analysis is described in our third paper. Given the highly stochastic nature of the apoptotic patterns we developed a method {{to take full advantage of}} the characteristics of zebrafish embryos, primarily their transparency and availability in large numbers. As the zebrafish becomes more widely accepted as a model for a diverse range of scientific questions, the development of such a technique is doubly important given the necessity of a cheap, reliable and simple generalizable method of analysing processes affecting cell viability in fish. This has clear importance for pharmacological studies, but is also a long overdue addition to the battery of controls available for highly invasive techniques such as microinjection, in which apoptosis is regularly found among its non specific effects.

40|$|Monomers are {{released}} from dental resin materials, and thus cause adverse biological effects in mammalian cells. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity {{of some of}} these methacrylates have been identified in a vast number of investigations during the last decade. It has been well-established that the co-monomer triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) causes gene mutations in vitro. The formation of micronuclei is indicative of chromosomal damage and the induction of DNA strand breaks detected with monomers like TEGDMA and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). As a consequence of DNA damage, the mammalian cell cycle was delayed in both G 1 and G 2 /M phases, depending on the concentrations of the monomers. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the <b>genetic</b> and cellular <b>toxicology</b> of resin monomers have remained obscure until recently. New findings indicate that increased oxidative stress results in an impairment of the cellular pro- and anti-oxidant redox balance caused by monomers. It has been demonstrated that monomers reduced the levels of the natural radical scavenger glutathione (GSH), which protects cell structures from damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Depletion of the intracellular GSH pool may then significantly contribute to cytotoxicity, because a related increase in ROS levels can activate pathways leading to apoptosis. Complementary, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects of TEGDMA and HEMA are inhibited in the presence of ROS scavengers like N-acetylcysteine (NAC), ascorbate, and Trolox (vitamin E). Elevated intracellular levels of ROS can also activate a complex network of redox-responsive macromolecules, including redox-sensitive transcription factors like nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). It has been shown that NF-kappaB is activated probably to counteract HEMA-induced apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by TEGDMA in human pulp cells has been associated with an inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) cell-survival signaling pathway. Although the details of the mechanisms leading to cell death, genotoxicity, and cell-cycle delay are not completely understood, resin monomers may be able to alter the functions of the cells of the oral cavity. Pathways regulating cellular homeostasis, dentinogenesis, or tissue repair may be modified by monomers at concentrations well below those which cause acute cytotoxicity...|$|R
50|$|In July 2010, Ocean Alliance, in {{partnership}} with the Wise Laboratory of Environmental and <b>Genetic</b> <b>Toxicology,</b> took the RV Odyssey into the area in an effort to determine the, often over-looked, long-term impacts of this environmental catastrophe. After such incidents, people often {{look no further than the}} immediate impact: death tolls of particular species are logged, population declines/increases recorded, and these figures are seen as broadly representative of the environmental damage. The toxicological work being conducted by Ocean Alliance and their partners at the Wise Lab was primarily aimed at determining the chronic, long-term impact of the incident-in particular the geno-toxic impacts of oil (and compounds found in oil) and dispersants as they work their way up the trophic food chain. The long-term effects are believed by many to be far more significant than the short-term effects, a belief corroborated by on-going research in the Gulf of Mexico and the fact that the impacts of the Exxon Valdez spill (which occurred in 1985 in Prince William Sound, Alaska) are still being studied over 25 years after the initial accident. In terms of total discharge of oil, this spill was approximately one tenth of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Perhaps the most significant economic impact of the Exxon Valdez disaster-the collapse of the Herring fishery, only collapsed four years after the spill, and to this day is not showing signs of recovery. This makes the kind of long-term focused program Ocean Alliance conducted all the more important. Preliminary analysis has shown potentially damaging levels of genotoxic metals including chromium and nickel in Sperm whales living in the area, significantly higher than the global average. Furthermore, it has shown a correlation between proximity to the spill and levels of these genotoxic metals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>toxicology</b> {{represents}} {{a study of}} the genetic damage that a cell can incur, the agents that induce such damage, the damage response mechanisms available to cells and organisms, and the potential consequences of such damage. Genotoxic agents are abundant in the environment and are also induced endogenously. The consequences of such damage can include carcinogenesis and teratogenesis. An understanding of <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicology</b> is essential to carry out risk evaluations of the impact of genotoxic agents and to assess how individual genetic differences influence the response to genotoxic damage. In recent years, the importance of maintaining genomic stability has become increasingly recognized, in part by the realization that failure of the damage response mechanisms underlies many, if not all, cancer incidence. The importance of these mechanisms is also underscored by their remarkable conservation between species, allowing the study of simple organisms to provide significant input into our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. It has also become clear that the damage response mechanisms interface closely with other aspects of cellular metabolism including replication, transcription and cell cycle regulation. Moreover, defects in many of these mechanisms, as observed for example in ataxia telangiectasia patients, confer disorders with associated developmental abnormalities demonstrating their essential roles during growth and development. In short, while a decade ago, {{a study of the}} impact of DNA damage was seen as a compartmentalized area of cellular research, it is now appreciated to lie at the centre of an array of cellular responses of crucial importance to human health. Consequently, this has become a dynamic and rapidly advancing area of research. The <b>Genetic</b> <b>Toxicology</b> Gordon Research Conference is biannual with an evolving change in the emphasis of the meetings. From evaluating the nature of genotoxic chemicals, which lay at the centre of the early conferences, the emphasis has moved to understanding how cells and organisms respond to the different forms of genotoxic damage incurred. By understanding these mechanisms, the risk to humans can be more rationally assessed and evaluated. More recently, the format of the meetings have aimed to facilitate input from the range of disciplines that can now provide insight into the field.

These effects are closely linked with cancer initiation (Simone Reuter 2011; Jindal & Singh 2014; Lindberg et al. 2011).|$|E
