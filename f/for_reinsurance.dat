50|$|When a {{non-life}} insurance company closes {{a contract to}} provide insurance against loss, the revenues (premiums) expected to be received {{over the life of}} the contract are called gross premiums written. Insurance companies often purchase reinsurance to protect themselves against the risk of a loss above a certain threshold; the cost of reinsurance (reinsurance premiums) is deducted from gross premiums written to arrive at net premiums written. Net premiums written is the sum of all types of insurance premiums which a company may collect throughout the whole duration of existing insurance policies minus the costs like agent's commissions or payments made <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance.</b>|$|E

The first insurer selects the reinsurance coverage that maximizes his expected utility. No conditions are imposed on the reinsurer’s payment. The optimality condition involves the gradient of H.

50|$|With reinsurance, {{the insurer}} can issue {{policies}} with higher limits than {{would otherwise be}} allowed, thus {{being able to take}} on more risk because some of that risk is now transferred to the reinsurer. The reason for this is the number of insurers that have suffered significant losses and become financially impaired. Over the years there has been a tendency <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> to become a science rather than an art: thus reinsurers have become much more reliant on actuarial models and on tight review of the companies they are willing to reinsure. They review their financials closely, examine the experience of the proposed business to be reinsured, review the underwriters that will write that business, review their rates, and much more.|$|E
50|$|CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluation and Standardizing Target Accumulations) {{was founded}} as a joint project of Swiss Reinsurance Company, Gerling-Konzern Globale Reinsurance Company, and Munich Reinsurance Company. CRESTA has set itself {{the aim of}} {{establishing}} a globally uniform system for the accumulation risk control of natural hazards - particularly earthquakes, storms and floods. Those risk zones are essentially based on the observed and expected seismic activity, {{as well as on}} other natural disasters, such as droughts, floods and storms. CRESTA zones regard the distribution of insured values within a region or country for easier assessment of risks. CRESTA Zones are the essential basis <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> negotiation and portfolio analysis. Nowadays, CRESTA sets widely accepted standards which apply throughout the international insurance industry. CRESTA zone information is used by most insurers for assessing the insurance catastrophe premiums they will charge.|$|E
50|$|There is {{basically}} no risk that cannot be insured against, {{however it is}} difficult to assess how risky it is to give out insurance contracts to customers and to assess for insurance providers how high their rates should be. One main indicator for every insurer is the premiums that are paid for their reinsurance. When applying <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> the forms will often be based on the models provided by CRESTA. CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and Standardising Target Accumulations) is an independent group led by Munich Re and Swiss Re which promotes the accurate and efficient mapping and evaluation of catastrophe perils. CRESTA furthermore and most importantly established a worldwide zone classification used within the insurance industry, the CRESTA Zones. The CRESTA Zones are defined for much of the world down to postcode level. CRESTA Zones can form the basis of reinsurance negotiation and portfolio analysis.|$|E

50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{operational}} definition of insurance presented {{at the beginning of}} this article proved inadequate as a result of contracts that had the form but not the substance of insurance. The essence of insurance is the transfer of risk from the insured to one or more insurers. How much risk a contract actually transfers proved to be at the heart of the controversy. This issue arose most clearly in reinsurance, where the use of Financial Reinsurance to reengineer insurer balance sheets under US GAAP became fashionable during the 1980s. The accounting profession raised serious concerns about the use of reinsurance in which little if any actual risk was transferred, and went on to address the issue in FAS 113, cited above. While on its face, FAS 113 is limited to accounting <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> transactions, the guidance it contains is generally conceded to be equally applicable to US GAAP accounting for insurance transactions executed by commercial enterprises.|$|E
50|$|Since the 2005 {{pull back}} by {{insurance}} giants Allstate, State Farm, etc., small, in-state {{companies have been}} taking {{a larger share of}} policies. These start-ups have not followed the traditional insurance model by accumulating cash reserves to cover expenses in high claim years. Instead, they pay as much as half of the policy premium <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> to offshore companies to cover claims. In the seven years since the last major Florida hurricane, profits have risen, but many small companies shifted that money into affiliated businesses and ignored the need for a reserve. Insurance rates were based on the company making a reasonable profit after expenses, which included funding a reserve. The OIR suggests that insurance companies have reserves and reinsurance to cover a once in 100-year storm. Many firms in past years purchased less, and if claims exceeded reinsurance and reserves, they were taken over by the state, who paid off remaining claims.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates whether U. S. property-liability {{insurers}} {{change their}} demand <b>for</b> <b>reinsurance</b> after demutualization.

One possible explanation is that converting insurers may treat reinsurance to affiliated reinsurers as risk retention rather than risk transfer so that they can reduce reinsurance cost.
