5|$|Raurava (fearful or hell of rurus): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it is {{assigned}} {{for a person}} who cares about his own and his family's good, but harms other living beings and is always envious of others. The living beings hurt by such a man {{take the form of}} savage serpent-like beasts called rurus and torture this person. The Vishnu Purana deems this hell fit for a <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> or one who lies.|$|E
25|$|The lying {{witness is}} a {{deceitful}} man, who mocks at justice. He {{is like a}} war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow. ″A <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> will not go unpunished.″ king Solomon says. ″A <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> will perish″ {{if he does not}} repent.|$|E

25|$|Witt's last {{appearance}} before Congress came in 1955. Harvey Matusow, former CPUSA member, had previously testified before Congress against his former comrades. However, in 1954, Matusow published a book, <b>False</b> <b>Witness,</b> {{in which he}} recanted his anti-communist testimony. In April 1955, the Subcommittee on Internal Security learned that Witt had obtained a cash donation from the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union to help Matusow get his book published. Witt was called before the Subcommittee on Internal Security on April 18 to testify about {{his involvement in the}} Matusow affair.

25|$|By 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong {{had become}} resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now {{was a senior}} chancellor, for {{dressing}} down their brother Zhang Changyi (張昌儀) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi (張昌期). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei {{would find a way}} to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian (高戩), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate Zhang Shuo to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear <b>false</b> <b>witness.</b> As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.|$|E
25|$|After lengthy preparations, {{the fleet}} {{was ready to}} sail. The night before they were to leave, someone {{destroyed}} many of the hermai—the stone markers representing Hermes, placed around the city for good luck. This event was taken very seriously by the Athenian people as it was considered a bad omen for the expedition, as well as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the government. According to Plutarch, Androcles, a political enemy of Alcibiades, used <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> to claim that Alcibiades {{and his friends were}} responsible. Alcibiades volunteered to be put on trial under penalty of death in order to prove his innocence (wanting to avoid his enemies charging him, in his absence, with more false information), but this request was denied.|$|E
25|$|After {{eighteen}} months a scandal arose, {{which led to}} Nephon's removal. Specifically, the previous Patriarch Symeon I died without making his will. İşkender Bey, one of the sons of Symeon's main sponsor, George Amiroutzes, had converted to Islam and {{was at the time}} the treasurer of the Sultan. He requested that all the inheritance of Symeon, which included also ecclesiastic items, should pass to the Sultan's treasury. To avoid this, Nephon pretended that a nephew of the deceased patriarch was the legitimate heir, finding three monks that bore <b>false</b> <b>witness.</b> After discovering the truth, the Sultan Bayezid II confiscated the property of Symeon, punished the clergy involved in the scandal, and exiled Nephon. Nephon was exiled to some island in the Black Sea off Sozopol and was deposed in the first months of 1488. According to scholar Steven Runciman, Nephon was a foolish and unsatisfactory Patriarch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} example with a nontrivial {{subgroup of}} <b>false</b> <b>witnesses</b> is 9 = 3 × 3. There are 6 residues relatively prime to 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. Since 8 is congruent to −1 modulo 9, {{it follows that}} 88 is congruent to 1 modulo 9. So 1 and 8 are false positives for the [...] "primality" [...] of 9 (since 9 is not actually prime). These are in fact the only ones, so the subgroup {1,8} is the subgroup of <b>false</b> <b>witnesses.</b> The same argument shows that n − 1 is a [...] "false witness" [...] for any odd composite n.|$|R

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{catastrophe}} of 1391 the Jews began again {{to settle on}} the island, and on Jan. 21, 1393, the governor issued an edict for their protection, providing that a citizen who should injure a Jew should be hanged, and that a knight for the same offense should be subjected to the strappado. The advantageous position of the islands, the tradingpoint midway between Catalonia, Provence, and Sicily, attracted thither many of the Jews of Provence and Sicily, besides some from Tunis, Algiers, and other African cities. In the height of their prosperity there were in Majorca {{more than a thousand}} Jewish families. Among those who settled {{there were a number of}} people of treacherous character, who acted as informers against their fellow-Jews, and, through malice and envy or to extort money, bore <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> against men of blameless reputation, until, at the request of the community, they were expelled from the island.|$|E
25|$|Joey Branning (David Witts) catches Carl dealing {{drugs in}} the nightclub, R and informs Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Kirsty's husband Max Branning (Jake Wood), who confront and {{threaten}} Carl. Max calls the police because he thinks Carl is involved in Kirsty nearly getting mugged by Carl's brother Adam White (Ben Wigzell) and Carl is checked for drugs by the police in front of Kirsty. Carl has none, and later tells Max that in three weeks' time, he will end Max and Kirsty's relationship. Three weeks later, Carl deliberately cuts the brakes on his car, then takes Phil as his passenger, and crashes it after releasing Phil's seatbelt. Phil is hospitalised and Carl frames Max for cutting the brakes after forcing Ian to become a <b>false</b> <b>witness,</b> promising to cancel the debt. Max is arrested and released on bail, until Carl goads him into attacking him, and he is remanded in custody. Max ends his relationship with Kirsty under Carl's instructions, who has threatened to harm his daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa).|$|E
25|$|Parties and {{witnesses}} {{were put on}} oath. The penalty for <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> was usually the punishment {{that would have been}} awarded the victim if convicted. In matters beyond human knowledge, such as the guilt or innocence of an alleged practitioner of magic or a suspected wife, the ordeal by water was used. The accused jumped into the sacred river, and the innocent swam while the guilty drowned. The accused could clear himself by taking an oath if the only knowledge available was his own. The plaintiff could swear to his loss by brigands, the price paid for a slave purchased abroad, or the sum due to him; but great stress was laid on the production of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a document. The judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by the affidavit of the witnesses to it and then issue an order that whenever found, it should be submitted. The clay tablets of contracts that were annulled were broken. The court might even travel to view the property and take with them the sacred symbols with which oaths were made.|$|E

The <b>false</b> <b>witnesses</b> must pay the difference {{of the value of}} the loan [...] "in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) 10 years...The difference is the sum that the testimony of the (<b>false)</b> <b>witnesses</b> sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{his release}} unconditionally by the {{decision}} of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in April 2009,Sayyed was authorized by the Decision of the same Tribunal on May 12, 2011, to receive from the Tribunal the elements of proof related to the <b>false</b> <b>witnesses</b> who caused his arbitrary detention for 4 years in order to allow him to pursue them legally before national competent justices. After receiving from the Special Tribunal for Lebanon most of the documents related to the <b>false</b> <b>witnesses</b> and their partners who caused his arbitrary detention, Sayyed started different legal actions aiming to pursue them in and outside Lebanon, mainly the two Syrian <b>false</b> <b>witnesses</b> Moahamad Zouheyr Siddik and Hutham Hutham. Within the detention period of Gl Jamil El Sayyed, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights in Geneva considered, in an official report of its Work Team on arbitrary detention dated November 30, 2007, that his detention was arbitrary and violated articles 9 & 14 of the International Pact for Civil and Political Rights. In the Annual Reports of 2006, 2007 and 2009 of the US Department for Human Rights Department, Sayyed was considered as an Arbitrary detained by the Lebanese Authorities.|$|R

She visits Janine in prison, and agrees to provide a <b>false</b> <b>witness</b> statement for Michael's murder, in return for Janine dropping false charges against Stacey, {{so that she can}} return to Walford. At her trial, Janine confesses to her crimes, and Kat is charged with perjury. She is devastated when Stacey hands herself over to the police for Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) murder, five years previously. Kat attends a hearing, and is given a suspended sentence.

The financial situation becomes worse for the Moons when Alfie reveals they are to be evicted as they have not been paying their bills.|$|E
25|$|Phil and Sharon reunite {{after her}} {{relationship}} with Jack ends. However, it ends when Sharon's painkiller addiction puts Lexi in danger. Lola regains full custody of Lexi, leaving Phil feeling lonely. When Shirley's benefits are cut and she is forced {{to move out of}} the B, Phil secretly pays her rent. Shirley finds out and believes he is doing it so she will stay quiet about his involvement in Heather's death. Shirley demands money from Phil, which he does not have, forcing him to accept a deal from newcomer Carl White (Daniel Coonan). Carl wants to depose Phil as the top man in Albert Square, so as they drive off to a deal Carl says he has arranged, Carl deliberately crashes the car after releasing Phil's seatbelt, causing Phil to be thrown through the windscreen. He is airlifted to hospital and requires an operation. While he is recovering, he puts his cousin Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) in charge of his businesses. Carl tries to intimidate her and use the garage for illegal purposes. Shirley confronts Carl about his actions, and she mysteriously disappears after this, though her friends believe she has gone to Greece as she had planned. Once recovered, Phil learns that Carl is framing Max Branning (Jake Wood) for causing the car crash, and is using Ian as a <b>false</b> <b>witness.</b> Phil kidnaps Ian on the day of Max's trial so he cannot testify, and then kidnaps Carl once Max is acquitted. Phil prepares to kill Carl, but Carl implies that he caused harm to Shirley. He takes Phil to a block of run-down flats where Shirley is staying with her sister Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). It is revealed that Carl threatened Shirley to stay away from Walford or he would harm Phil's family. Carl leaves, and Phil pleads with Shirley to return to Walford. They return together, then Phil confronts Carl. Carl declares that he has contacts inside prison who can harm Ben if Phil does anything to him.|$|E
