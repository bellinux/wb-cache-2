40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the use of}} an airborne <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> for measuring snowpack depth, density, and water content. A transmitter sends a sequence of pulses of stepped frequencies, and the reflections are measured by a sensitive receiver. The combination of the snowpack and the earth interacts with the electromagnetic wave so as to modify the characteristics of the reflected signals. The variation of the reflected intensity with frequency provides the desired data. A theoretical analysis of return signal and snowpack parameter relationships is given, and the results of experimental verification of the theory are discussed...|$|E
40|$|An <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> for the {{measurement}} of the respiratory activity is presented. The aims are to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and in particular to evaluate {{the effect on the}} measured signal of the distance between the subject and the sensing apparatus. Moreover, an electromagnetic model of the system, including the monitored subject, is proposed as a tool {{to solve the problem of}} selecting working parameters for system design. The sensing system is based on {{the measurement}} of the phase variation of the reflection coefficient caused by the respiratory activity. The phase signal compared with the thorax displacement measured by a reference instrument shows a high correlation () for different subject postures (sitting, standing, and lying) and a reduction of the signal amplitude with the distance [*]dB/cm is reported. The numerical simulations performed on a wide-band highlight the frequencies where the method exhibits the highest sensitivity to thorax movements. The sensitivity can be further improved by reducing the antenna beamwidth. Despite the signal amplitude reduction, the proposed system makes it possible to correctly operate at distances up to 2. 5 [*]m...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} parametric three-dimensional (3 D) finite element analysis techniques to accurately model the response of a new industrial <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>system.</b> The study focuses on a magnetic transformation detector for hot steel strip, which is capable of measuring the austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation fraction of hot steel on-line as the material cools below the Curie temperature. This sensor presents several challenges with regard to modelling its response. First, small changes (0. 3 mT) in the measured magnetic field must be detected against a much larger background value (160 mT). Second, {{the response of the}} sensor to variation in lift-off must be accurately determined so that changes in lift-off could be subsequently rejected using an appropriate compensation algorithm. Finally, an accurate model (error < 0. 2 %) of the sensor was essential to avoid the need for extensive laboratory testing. The paper describes a number of approaches to address these issues. The paper presents an overview of the sensor and its application, together with a summary of the models used. A number of different approaches were used to improve the accuracy of the modelling process including, mesh configurations, model definition and output calibration, which are also described. Outputs from the model are then compared with the measurement values. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using calibrated simulations to describe the response of the sensor to the required accuracy and repeatability for symmetrical geometries. Further work is needed to assess the feasibility of the calibration method for more complex systems...|$|E

40|$|Planar <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} used as one of the NDT methods to {{evaluate}} the material properties i. e., to evaluate near-surface properties such as conductivity, permeability and dielectric properties. The applications of planar electromagnetic sensors will depend on both the characteristic of the sensor type chosen and also the characteristic of material under test. Conventional planar interdigital sensors and novel planar interdigital sensors have been designed, fabricated and tested for detection of dangerous marine biotoxins in seafood. Our main objective is to sense the presence of dangerous contaminated acid in mussels and other seafoods. Initial studies were conducted with three peptide derivatives namely Sarcosine, Proline and Hydroxylproline. These three chemicals are structurally closely related to our target molecule (domoic acid). The initial results have shown that all sensors respond very well to the chemicals and it is possible to discriminate the different chemicals from the output of the sensor. Novel interdigital sensors have shown better sensitivity measurement compared to conventional interdigital sensors. The novel interdigital sensors were then being tested with three seafood products. Results from the analysis have shown that novel interdigital sensor with configuration # 1 (Sensor_ 1) has better sensitivity compared to other sensors. Sensor_ 1 has been chosen for experiment using proline and mussels. The changes in sensor sensitivity were analysed with mussels before and after adding the proline. The presence of proline on the mussel surface and also injected proline to the mussel samples were clearly detected by Sensor_ 1. Further experiment was conducted with small amount of domoic acid (0. 5 µg to 5. 0 µg) injected to a mussel and it was found that Sensor_ 1 was able to detect small amount of domoic acid (1. 0 µg) injected into the mussel sample. Sensor_ 1 was able to detect approximately 12. 6 µg/g of domoic acid in mussel meat. Three threshold levels of particular sample thickness have been established for detection of domoic acid. The first prototype of a low cost sensing system known as SIT (Seafood Inspection Tool) has been developed. The outcomes from the experiments provide chances of opportunity for further research in developing a low cost miniature type of sensors for reliable sensing system for commercial use...|$|E
40|$|Dryland {{salinity}} {{is increasing}} {{in the upper}} catchments of central and northern New South Wales, Australia. Consequently, salts may be exported downstream, which could adversely affect cotton irrigated-farming systems. In order to assess the potential threat of salinity a simple salt balance model based on progressively saline water (i. e., ECiw 0. 4, 1. 5, 4. 0 and 9. 0 dS/m) was used to simulate {{the potential impact of}} salinisation due to the farming systems. The study was carried out in the lower Namoi valley of northern New South Wales, Australia. A comparison has been made of the various non-linear techniques (indicator kriging, multiple indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging) to determine an optimal simulation method for the risk assessment. The simulation results indicate that potential salinisation due to application of the water currently used for irrigation (ECiw) is minimal and may not pose any problems to sustainability of irrigated agriculture. The same results were obtained by simulation based on irrigation using slightly more saline water (ECiw 1. 4 dS/m). However, simulations based on irrigation using water of even lower quality (ECiw of 4 and 9. 0 dS/m), shows potential high salinisation, which will require management inputs for sustainable cropping systems, especially legumes and wheat, which are used extensively in rotation with cotton. Disjunctive kriging was the best simulation method, as it produced fewer misclassifications in comparison with multiple-indicator kriging and indicator kriging. This study thus demonstrates that we can predict the salinity risk due to application of irrigation water of lower quality than that of the current water used. In addition, the results suggest here problems of excessive deep drainage and inefficient use of water might be a problem. The second part of this thesis deals with soil information required at the field scale for management practices particularly in areas where deep drainage is large. Unfortunately, traditional methods of soil inventory at the field level involve the design and adoption of sampling regimes and laboratory analysis that are time-consuming and costly. Because of this more often than not only limited data are collected. In areas where soil salinity is prevalent, detailed quantitative information for determining its cause is required to prescribe management solutions. This part deals with the description of a Mobile <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Sensing</b> <b>System</b> (MESS) and its application in an irrigated-cotton field suspected of exhibiting soil salinity. The field is within the study area of part one of this thesis-located about 2 km south west of Wee Waa. The EM 38 and EM 31 (ECa) data provide information, which was used in deciding where soil sample sites could be located in the field. The ECa data measured by the EM 38 instrument was highly correlated with the effective cation exchange capacity. This relationship can be explained by soil mineralogy. Using different soil chemical properties (i. e. ESP and Ca/Mg ratio) a detailed transect study was undertaken to measure soil salinity adjoining the water storage. It is concluded that the most appropriate management option to remediation of the problem would be to excavate the soil directly beneath the storage floor where leakage is suspected. It is recommended that the dam not be enlarged from its current size owing to the unfavourable soil mineralogy (i. e. kaolin/illite) located in the area where it is located...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} criteria in managing salinity {{is the ability to}} quantify the amount of salt stored in the environment.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{of animals}} and humans causing medical complications in burns, wounds, and cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is efficient at adapting its virulence phenotype depending {{on the site of}} infection. Emerging multi-drug resistant strains and a limited number of effective anti-pseudomonal antibiotics renders P. aeruginosa infections increasingly difficult to treat. To address this need, this thesis considers targeting bacterial quorum sensing, which regulates the production of virulence factors, as an alternative prophylactic strategy. The P. aeruginosa quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> is compromised of three interlinked but independent systems, Las, Rhl and Pqs, which produce and utilise quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecules, 3 OC 12 -HSL, C 4 -HSL and PQS respectively. Immunological targeting of the quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecule 3 OC 12 -HSL, through active immunisation (vaccines), inhibits the Las system, resulting in a longer life expectancy in mice infected with P. aeruginosa in vivo. However, P. aeruginosa has the capacity to develop resistance, through compensatory mechanisms, towards quorum sensing inhibition that targets the Las system only. This emphasises the need to target all three quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>systems,</b> Las, Rhl, and the Pqs, in order to inhibit quorum sensing. The present study focuses particularly on the development of a multi-component anti-quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> vaccine that would target the three main quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecules, effectively compromising the quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> and minimising compensatory mechanisms. This involved the synthesis of haptens based on the quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecules, which were used to haptenise the immunogenic carrier keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Syntheses of the haptens, AP 1 (derivative of 3 OC 8 -HSL) and AP 2 (derivative of PQS), were conducted using adapted published methods. The resulting conjugates, AP 1 -keyhole limpet haemocyanin and AP 2 -keyhole limpet haemocyanin were immunogenic in mice and rabbits. The specific anti-hapten polyclonal antibodies that were generated demonstrated cross-reactivity with the natural quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecules of P. aeruginosa that translated in significant and specific anti-quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> molecule activity in bioluminescence reporter assays. Anti-AP 1 polyclonal antibodies were able to reduce biofilm formation at high concentrations, however, significant reduction of biofilm formation was seen when the anti-hapten antibodies were used in combination. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of the quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> should include the three systems, Las, Rhl and PQS, and that this can be done by a multi-component anti-quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> vaccine. These data suggest that a multi-component anti-quorum <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> vaccine takes us a step forward to a viable prophylaxis against P. aeruginosa for susceptible patients.

Reliability and real-time performance of vehicle <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> are greatly influenced when deadlock happens.

In order to address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient deadlock solving method. Firstly, the deadlock problem in a vehicle <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed based on four deadlock occurring conditions (i.e., mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait). Secondly, an optimization model is built to combine the quantity and cost of tasks in vehicle <b>sensing</b> <b>systems.</b> After that, a co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) is developed to search the optimal deadlock solving strategy.

This thesis describes {{the details of the}} design, fabrication, experimental measurement, and theoretical modeling of chip scale optical <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> integrated with electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidic systems. Heterogeneous integration, a technology that integrates multiple optical thin film semiconductor devices onto arbitrary host substrates, has been utilized for this thesis. Three different integrated <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> were explored and realized. First, an integrated optical sensor based upon the heterogeneous integration of an InGaAs thin film photodetector with a digital microfluidic system was demonstrated. This integrated <b>sensing</b> <b>system</b> detected the chemiluminescent signals generated by a pyrogallol droplet solution mixed with H 2 O 2 delivered by the digital microfluidic system. Second, polymer microresonator sensors were explored. Polymer microresonators are useful components for chip scale integrated sensing because they can be integrated in a planar format using standard semiconductor manufacturing technologies. Therefore, as a second step, chip scale optical microdisk/ring sensors integrated with digital microfluidic systems were fabricated and measured.. The response of the microdisk and microring <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> to the change index of refraction, due to the glucose solutions in different concentrations presented by the digital microfluidic to the resonator surface, were measured to be 95 nm/RIU and 87 nm/RIU, respectively.
