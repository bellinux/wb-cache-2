5|$|On 7 June 2008, a Eurocopter AS350 {{crashed on}} the runway at Nuuk Airport. There were no injuries, but the {{helicopter}} was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Losses on {{the ground}} {{amounted}} to eight fighters (two Spitfires). Around 28 aircraft of other types were destroyed {{on the ground}}. The total destroyed or <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> amounted to 68 aircraft, although 17 of these were trainers or non-operational types.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 2009, at 4:27am, two trains {{collided}} at the West Falls Church train yard. One train {{pulled in}} and collided {{into the back}} of the other train. No customers were aboard, and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported. However, three cars (1106, 1171, and 3216) were believed to be <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On 1 June 2012, a Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-400 skidded off {{the runway}} in heavy rain. Nobody was hurt, but the plane {{sustained}} <b>damage</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{is a list}} of {{accidents}} and incidents involving Ethiopian Airlines aircraft. It includes hijackings, events involving fatalities and/or events causing <b>damage</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> to the relevant aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a {{fiberglass}} Baby Jesus valued at US$375 {{was stolen from}} a Eureka Springs, Arkansas park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a swastika, and a Hitler mustache. The eyes were also blacked out and pieces had been broken off, rendering it <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|The running air battles {{had cost}} the Ju 87 units heavily. The lack of {{protection}} for I./StG 77 had cost it 10 Ju 87s with one <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> Total manpower losses for the unit amounted to 17 killed or mortally wounded, six wounded and five captured out of 56 men. II./StG 77 lost three Ju 87s to fighter attack and one <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair,</b> five crewmen dead and one captured. III./StG 77 also lost two Ju 87s and two damaged with four men killed. StG 77s casualties amounted to 26 killed, six taken prisoner, and six wounded. The battles brought {{the number of}} Ju 87s lost thus far in the campaign to 59 with a further 33 damaged. The price was too high and {{with the exception of}} sporadic attacks on convoys later in the year, the Ju 87 played no further part in the Battle of Britain. Among the dead was Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann Herbert Meisel.|$|E
5|$|In October 97 these {{tensions}} {{came to a}} {{head when}} the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Haapai, {{the islands}} {{closest to the}} epicentre, the wharf was damaged {{and a number of}} water-pipes and {{telephone}} lines were broken. Niuui hospital suffered severe <b>damage</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 25 January 2008, Canadian Airways Congo Boeing 727-247 9L-LEF was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair</b> when it {{was struck}} on the ground by Aéro-Service Antonov An-12BP EK-11660 which suffered a brake failure while taxiing. The An-12 was also <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> economic <b>repair.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 17, 1989, Douglas DC-3 N4425N, Douglas C-47s N100SD, N4471J and N4577Z, were <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair</b> by Hurricane Hugo at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan Puerto Rico. Douglas C-49J N28346 was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> economic <b>repair</b> at Cyril E. King Airport, Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands by Hurricane Hugo.|$|R
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} designed by Paul Due, who used the same architectural plan for four other mountain stations on the line. The snow tunnel has caught fire five times. The fires in 1948, 1953 and 2008 only caused minor damage to the tunnel itself. The 1960 fire burned-down the tunnel, the station building {{and most of the}} station area. The last fire, in 2011, had a Class 73 train caught in the tunnel; both it and the tunnel were <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Altogether, the Luftwaffe lost between 69 and 71 {{aircraft}} {{destroyed or}} <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> {{as a result}} of its operations over Britain on 18 August 1940. Of this total, 59 were lost to certain or probable action by fighters while two fell to ground fire, four to a combination of both and one collided with a British training aircraft. The remaining three crashed in German-held territory owing to technical failures. Altogether, the losses represented seven per cent of the force committed. Around 29 aircraft crashed in England. Personnel losses were 94 German crews killed, 40 captured and 25 returned with wounds. Some 27 to 31 German aircraft returned with damage.|$|E
50|$|In 1798, Trullet was {{appointed}} to the 74-gun Guerrier, on which he took part in the Battle of the Nile. His ship hopelessly damaged, he ordered the colours struck, and was taken prisoner. Guerrier was set on fire after the battle as she was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The sole Fleetwing {{remained}} in use until mid-1932, not least as a seaplane trainer and sea-state {{investigator for the}} successful 1931 Schneider Trophy team. In April 1932, the Fleetwing was on [...] for catapult trials, 28 successful flights terminated by an emergency landing and <b>damage</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> in retrieval.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 July 1959 Rani of Aera, a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation (registered VT-DIN) {{carrying}} 46 people (39 {{passengers and}} seven crew) crashed on approach to Santacruz Airport in conditions of poor visibility due to rain. The aircraft suffered <b>damage</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> and was written off. There were no fatalities.|$|R
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} state of affairs {{continued}} to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E
5|$|Ignoring the batteries, Stopford {{ordered his}} {{squadron}} to attack at 09:00 on 24 February, HMS Defiance leading the line. Shortly after the main batteries of Stopford's ships {{of the line}} came into the battle, the French ships were overwhelmed {{one by one and}} shortly after noon all three had been driven ashore with heavy casualties. British histories recount that all three were destroyed, although French histories report that they were salvaged but found to be <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> The fleet under Willaumez was trapped in the anchorage at Basque Roads on 26 February and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in April with heavy losses.|$|E
5000|$|... 11 January 1969: a Douglas C-47A PP-SPR was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair</b> at Loanda, Paraná.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 October 1982, Vickers Viscount HC-ATV of SAN Ecuador was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1988, Vickers Viscount 9Q-CTS of Filair was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair</b> in {{a landing}} accident.|$|R
5|$|On 18 December 1939, Vickers Wellington bombers {{carried out}} a raid on German {{shipping}} in {{what became known as}} the Air Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Detected on radar and engaged en route to their targets, over half the attacking force was destroyed or <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> Ludlow-Hewitt presented a report on the attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners. He again pressed for a new bombsight that featured stabilization to allow the aircraft to manoeuvre while it approached the target.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{damage was}} done to the church in 1400 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr; his forces also destroyed the Bishop's Palace at Llandaff. The damage was extensive enough to cause Bishop Blethyn to notify his fellow clergymen in 1575 that he believed the cathedral to possibly be <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> Most of the other damage was repaired, most notably by Bishop Marshall, whose reredos partly survives. The northwest tower, the one without a spire, was added by Jasper Tudor and is now named after him. He assumed the lordship of Cardiff after the accession to the throne of his nephew, King Henry VII of England.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore Naval Base {{suffered}} little {{damage in}} the fighting and became the Imperial Japanese Navy's most important facility outside of the Japanese home islands. The 15-inch guns were sabotaged by the British before the fall of Singapore, and four of them were deemed beyond repair and scrapped by the Japanese. The floating dry dock was scuttled by the British, but raised by the Japanese. It was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> by a raid by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in February 1945, and ultimately towed out to sea and dumped in 1946. The Royal Navy took repossession of the Singapore base in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 February 1948, SNCASE Languedoc P/7 F-BATK of Air France was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economical}} <b>repair.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 4 February 1948, F-BATK of Air France was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economical}} <b>repair</b> at Marignane Airport, Bouches-du-Rhône.|$|R
5|$|On 4 January 2000, a Class 92 {{train was}} <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> in the Åsta {{accident}} near Åsta Station on the Røros Line. Nineteen {{people were killed}} in the accident. From 7 January 2001, NSB made several major changes to the commuter rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Part of the reason for the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 {{when one of the}} handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair.</b> In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
50|$|On 8 October 1982, Vickers Viscount HC-ATV was <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> {{economic}} <b>repair</b> at Mariscal Lamar Airport, Cuenca.|$|R
