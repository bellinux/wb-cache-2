40|$|An {{access control}} system is often viewed as a state {{transition}} system. Given a set of access control policies, a <b>general</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirement</b> in such a system is {{to determine whether a}} desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for formal verification. While formal analysis on traditional RBAC has been done to some extent, the extensions of RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the performance of the approach under different configurations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to support DG Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) with a {{baseline}} study on non-harmonised Food Contact Materials (FCMs). The study aimed to analyse the existing regulatory frameworks at national or sectorial level to demonstrate compliance with the <b>general</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> for materials not harmonised at EU level. It also examined the perceived barrier to trade and burden of the current measures in place. Overall the entire sector of FCM suffers {{to a certain extent}} from the current situation which exhibits a lack of harmonisation of materials listed under the framework regulation and is the object of issues in mutual recognition. There are multiple legislation across Member States, but which are disparate for the different sectors. Measures are not always sufficiently detailed in particular for requirements and quality assurance towards declaration of compliance and supporting documents, certification where applicable, basis for enforcement and sanctions. In the absence of agreed incentives and requirements, MSs can face hurdles in demonstrating the lack of safety and practical difficulties for enforcement and removal of products in their own markets. With regards to GMP, generic guidance from MSs are also seldom very detailed from an implementation standpoint and rarely material specific. The HSFAA and BTSF actions clearly indicated that GMP was an endemic issue to the sector of FCM, although from the industry side, GMP is tackled by professional associations in the form of guidelines. It is however not clear whether these guidelines are used in practice by the members at national and local level {{all the way down to}} SMEs. Further indicators not existing at this stage would be needed. In terms of material-specific aspects, the main hurdles are access to relevant legislation and disparities in both the nature of substances considered, the types of restrictions and numerical values imposed. These factors constitute an impediment to mutual recognition. Practical implementation and enforcement is impeded by the lack of access or availability of testing methods to test compliance to legislative limits. The study found a gap in quantitative indicators to evaluate in more depth efficiency (including burden and barriers to trade) and for food safety particularly in regards to effectiveness.

40|$|Quick guide Nowadays, tattoos are {{considered}} body art and are largely spread. They are applied by injecting coloured inks into the dermis and {{are meant to}} stay life long, thus resulting in long term exposure to the chemicals injected including their degradation products. Permanent Make-up (PMU) consists in (semi) permanent tattoos used to resemble make-up. Policy context This report addresses {{the issue of the}} safety of tattoo/PMU products and practices with a view to contribute to consumers' health protection. It has been prepared on behalf of the Directorate General Justice and Consumers (DG JUST), however it might also be of interest to other stakeholders dealing with health, internal market and environment, {{as well as to the}} European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The conclusions of this project aim to provide the European Commission (EC) with the scientific evidences needed to decide if European Union (EU) measures are necessary to ensure the safety of tattoo/PMU inks and processes. In fact, apart from the <b>general</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> by the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) currently there is no specific EU legislation on tattoos/PMU products. In particular with regards to chemical requirements, there are chemicals which are banned in consumer products that get into direct contact with the skin under different EU legislations, like the Cosmetic Product Regulation or REACH, but not in tattoo inks. The report presents an updated review of the national legislative framework, ink ingredients in use and reported adverse health effects, as well as new data on analytical methods, statistics, market surveillance and RAPEX (Rapid alert system for non-food dangerous products) notifications, risk perception and communication and experience with the implementation of the Council of Europe (CoE) Resolutions (ResAP). Main findings Specific legislation, based on the CoE ResAPs (either of 2003 or 2008), exists in 7 Member States (MS) and 3 EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries. 3 MS notified their draft legal acts (currently on-hold). Statistics show that 12 % of Europeans and up to 24 % of United States' citizens are estimated to be tattooed, including teenagers. Tattoo prevalence in young adults may represent more than the double and is sometimes higher in women than in men, in particular in young generations. Tattoo/PMU inks contain several ingredients, plus impurities. More than 100 colorants and 100 additives are in use. Most tattoo inks on the EU market are imported from the US, while PMU inks are generally manufactured in Europe. The pigments used are not specifically produced for tattoo/PMU applications and generally show low purity. The majority of them is not authorised for the use in cosmetic products and several should not be present according to the CoE ResAP(2008) 1. Over 80 % of the colorants in use are organic and more than 60 % of them are azo-pigments, some of which can release carcinogenic aromatic amines. This degradation may happen in the skin, particularly under solar/Ultra Violet radiation exposure or laser irradiation. Harmonised analytical methods for the analysis of tattoo/PMU inks are missing and need to be developed. For market surveillance purposes test methods developed for other products are used with some modifications. Tattoo/PMU products containing hazardous chemicals have been found on the European market. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) (43 %), Primary Aromatic Amines (PAA) (14 %), heavy metals (9 %) and preservatives (6 %), as well as microbiological contamination (11 %) were detected in the indicated percentages of the analysed samples. In the absence of systematic data gathering, the actual prevalence of tattoo complications (mainly of dermatological nature) is currently unknown. Most complaints are transient and inherent to the wound healing process, but in some cases, up to 5 % of the tattooed persons, bacterial infections may occur, especially in unhygienic settings. Acute allergy and delayed hypersensitivity prompted by i. e. the inks ingredients and tattoo/removal trauma represent the bulk of tattoo/PMU complications, affecting mostly the red or black parts of the tattoos. Such nonspecific reactions, frequently exacerbated by sun exposure, are unpredictable and may sometimes appear after a long latency (decades), giving rise to chronic sequels in connection with underlying auto-immune pathologies. Additional adverse health effects, like skin pigmentation disorders may be encountered in 5 - 15 % of patients having laser therapy, which is not always effective in removing completely the undesired tattoos. (Skin) cancer risk from tattoo procedures has been neither proved nor excluded. Based on the experience gained from implementing national laws and the CoE ResAPs, experts agreed that an update of the chemical and labelling requirements would be desirable. Risk perception is mainly based on the information given by tattooists, parents or friends, or read in mass media and internet. Among students, awareness about infectious risks seems to be higher that on non-infectious ones, but that knowledge is often only superficial. Many data gaps and research needs were identified. Key conclusions This report provides an up-to-date snapshot of the tattoo/PMU phenomenon. Due to the wide variety of legislative frameworks across Member States, some products can be sold in some MSs but not in others, because of different chemical or authorisation requirements, thus resulting in a fragmentation of the internal market. This might also have an impact on the protection of consumers' health. Tattooing is an increasing fashion phenomenon which already involves over 60 million Europeans. In parallel, removal procedures are becoming more frequent. Adverse health effects linked to the application and removal of tattoos are reported in the literature; in addition the potential long term effects of exposure to the chemicals in the inks are still unknown and might become critical with time due to the high number of tattooed people. To bring light into this unknown area, even if costly, epidemiological studies and research on the fate of ingredients in the whole body are needed. In particular, prospective cohort studies should be conducted to investigate the correlation between tattoos and possible carcinogenesis. Good Manufacturing Practices for manufacturing tattoo/PMU inks, as well as guidelines for their risk assessment should be developed. A full risk assessment of the ingredients, in particular colorants, used in tattoo/PMU inks is needed, including their phototoxicity, absorption level, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as well as Derived No Effect Level (DNEL), data which are largely missing so far. Further to this, it needs to be assessed whether the risks arising from the use of certain chemicals in tattoo/PMU inks are adequately controlled or need to be addressed by an EU measure. In the absence of this risk assessment, for azo pigments a precautionary approach would consist in not using those that contain in their structure aromatic amines classified as Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or Reprotoxic (CMR). Harmonised analytical methods should be developed to ensure reproducible results and allow a correct implementation of the chemical requirements of legislation in place. Market surveillance activities should be continued to identify hazardous products and be carried out also on products sold on-line. Additional information campaigns on risks for potential clients, particular targeted to teenagers and young people should be undertaken, allowing an informed choice. The training of tattooists should be compulsory and cover at least some key topics. The preparation of harmonised hygiene guidelines is highly recommended and inspections of studios required. The phenomenon of clandestine backyard tattooing should be stopped. Related and future JRC work Three detailed reports on specific part of this project were published in 2015 and 2016 [1 - 3]. JRC.

Bu anlamda tren güzergâhlarında meydana gelebilecek çakışmaların engellenmesi büyük önem taşımaktadır. Trenlerin demiryolu üzerinde güvenli bir şekilde hareket edebilmesi için anklaşman sistemleri kullanılmaktadır. Çakışma probleminin giderilmesi için anklaşman sistemlerinin etkin bir şekilde tasarlanmasına ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Aksi takdirde anklaşman sistemlerinin tasarımında yapılacak en ufak hata bile raylı ulaşım sistemlerinin güvenliğini tehlikeye atacaktır. Anklaşman sistemlerinin etkin bir şekilde tasarlanıp gerçeklenmesi bu tezin ana konusunu oluşturmaktadır. Bu tez çalışmasında anklaşman sistemlerinin etkin bir şekilde tasarlanması ve gerçeklenmesi için Petri Ağları’nın kullanımı üzerinde durulmaktadır. Bunun için öncelikle Petri Ağları’nın tasarımsal amaçlı kullanımı ile ilgili bilgi altyapısı oluşturulmaktadır. Ardından Petri Ağları’nın modelleme yeteneğini arttırmak için tanımlanmış olan yay türleri ele alınmakta ve bu yay türlerinin hepsini içeren Petri Ağları’nın matematiksel olarak ifade edilebilmesi için “genelleştirilmiş durum denklemi” adı altında yeni bir durum denklemi önerisi ortaya atılmaktadır. Anklaşman sisteminin gerçeklenmesi için PLC kullanılacaktır. Dolayısıyla anklaşman sistemi için oluşturulacak Petri Ağları modelinin PLC koduna dönüştürülmesi gerekecektir.

It {{is vital}} to provide safety and {{availability}} of the railway transportation systems. For serving such a purpose, route conflicts should be prevented in the first place. However, railway transportation systems are complex in nature and this {{makes it hard to}} accomplish such a task. That is where railway interlocking systems come into play. Interlocking systems are utilized so that trains can safely move on the railway. This can only be achieved by an efficiently designed interlocking system. Otherwise, any simple flaw in the design would lead to route conflicts, thus rendering the railway transportation system unsafe. Efficient design and implementation of railway interlocking systems constitutes the main subject of this study. In this thesis, Petri Nets would be used for designing and implementation of interlocking systems. Petri Nets is a modeling tool that is able to represent systems both visually and mathematically. Visual aspects of Petri Nets are utilized to model the general structure of a system. Nevertheless, mathematical aspects of Petri Nets are used to realize the system dynamics. Petri Nets makes it possible to represent the system behavior mathematically via state equation. One can exploit mathematical features of Petri Nets to perform modeling, simulation, testing and verification of systems. In order to model large-scale systems using Petri Nets, particular enhancements have become necessary to overcome arising shortfalls and to improve modeling capability. Modular Petri Nets is introduced to model complex systems in modular way. This is useful for simplifying the investigation of the system. Colored Petri Nets is proposed to make it easy to keep track of specific events taking place within the system. Timed Petri Nets is created to represent time-dependent events in the system. Together with these enhancements, Petri Nets has become more powerful modeling tool. Specific arc types are defined to further enhance the modeling capability of Petri Nets. Inhibitor arcs are defined to enable a certain transition to take precedence over the other transitions. Using inhibitor arcs, it becomes possible to visually represent prioritization mechanism in Petri Nets. Enabling arcs are introduced to keep tokens in the input places while triggering the transition. An enabling arc is very similar to an ordinary arc. The only difference is the fact that when a transition is triggered, there is no token removal from the input place(s) connected to enabling arc(s). Nullifier arcs are proposed to remove all of the tokens from an input place at once when a transition is triggered. This functionality is used to implement the resetting mechanism in Petri Nets. In the literature, the state equation for Petri Nets is used to model and analyze systems mathematically. However, there are not any formalized state equations defined in order to cover inhibitor, enabling and nullifier arcs. Therefore, {{we do not have the}} opportunity to represent the systems mathematically when these types of arcs are involved. In this thesis, the state equation for Petri Nets is revisited and modified to obtain a novel state equation called “generalized state equation”. This state equation can be used to mathematically represent the behavior of inhibitor, enabling and nullifier arcs. Besides, software is developed and utilized to demonstrate the application of generalized state equation on an industrial automation system. Railway signalization systems play a major role in providing safety and reliability for the railway transportation systems. The main purpose of railway signalization systems is to prevent train collisions from happening. A railway signalization system is composed of three main elements such as traffic control center, interlocking system and the field equipments. Traffic control center is responsible for management and observation of the entire railway traffic. Route requests are created and train positions, switch positions, signal states are observed by traffic control center. There is a two-way communication between the traffic control center and the interlocking system. Route requests originated by the traffic control center is sent to the interlocking system and at the same time the status information coming from the field equipments is sent by the interlocking system to the traffic control center. As a result of this information exchange, the interlocking software processes the route requests and these requests are either accepted or rejected regarding the status of the field equipments. Interlocking software only accepts route requests that do not lead to train collisions. Interlocking system both gathers information from and sends commands to the field equipments. The field equipments form the infrastructure of the railway signalization system. The field equipments are composed of switches, track circuits and signals. Switches are mechanical devices that enable trains to change direction. Generally, switches have two positions such as “normal” and “reverse”. When a switch is in “normal” position, train crossing over this switch does not change its direction, whereas in “reverse” position switch causes train crossing over it to change its direction. Track circuits inform the interlocking system about the existence of a train on the railway. Signals are used to inform trains about whether the railway is occupied or not. “Red” light means the railway is occupied, whereas “green” light means the railway is free. The interlocking system is the decision maker in a railway signalization system. The main task of the interlocking system is to evaluate route requests coming from the traffic control center. During this evaluation, existing route requests and status of the field equipments are considered by the interlocking system. As a result, reasonable requests are accepted and the field equipments are locked accordingly to apply these requests. Unsuitable requests that cause collisions are rejected and are not applied. Interlocking system uses interlocking table to make these decisions. Interlocking table has entries for all of the possible routes and each of these entries identifies the conditions under which the corresponding route request should be accepted. It is clear that the reliability of a railway signalization system is directly related to the interlocking system. Therefore, safety standards called EN 50126, EN 50128 and EN 50129 are established by CENELEC to define <b>general</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> for the railway interlocking systems. Both the hardware and the software components of an interlocking system must fulfill these standards. It is essential to use formal methods for the design of the software in order to meet these security standards. In this thesis, the interlocking system would be implemented using PLC. In order to accomplish this task, at first, the interlocking system would be modeled using Petri Nets. Then, this Petri Nets model would have to be converted into PLC code. During literature research, it is observed that only visual aspects of Petri Nets are used for such a conversion process. And also, in the literature, there are not any available studies that exploit mathematical aspects of Petri Nets in order to realize interlocking systems using PLC code that is defined in IEC 61131 - 3 standards. In order to maintain an infrastructure that is favorable for programming, mathematical aspects of Petri Nets should be used for the conversion process. In this thesis, an efficient method is proposed to make the conversion from mathematical model of Petri Nets into PLC code that is defined in IEC 61131 - 3 standards. Then, this method is used to implement the interlocking system with PLC. In this method, conversion of Petri Nets into PLC code is directly accomplished by making use of the incidence matrix. At the same time, the proposed method also provides elimination of avalanche effect from which most of the systems suffer. In addition, software is developed to implement this methodology and usage of this software is shown on a case study. One can use this software to perform conversion of Petri Nets into PLC code automatically. In this study, in order to apply aforementioned method, a real-life railway station is considered. At first, the interlocking system of this station is designed modularly using Petri Nets. Modularity is provided by means of partitioning the interlocking system into subsystems. Then each of these subsystems is modeled using Petri Nets, which is further converted into PLC code using proposed methodology. This concludes design and implementation of the interlocking system using Petri Nets. Finally, SCADA application is developed to test the interlocking system and on this application, the implementation of this interlocking system is verified. DoktoraPh...|$|E
