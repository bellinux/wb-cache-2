The book contains additional information, scientific analysis, and Gore's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary.

25|$|The Allies mounted more gas attacks {{than the}} Germans in 1917 and 1918 {{because of a}} marked {{increase}} in production of gas from the Allied nations. Germany was unable {{to keep up with}} this pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle, mostly as a result of very costly methods of production. Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany. Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front was blowing from west to east, which meant the British more frequently had favorable conditions for a <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> than did the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} methane is {{estimated}} to be 65 cubic kilometres. If burnt over one year, it would give an average power of about 100 gigawatts for the whole period. There is also an estimated 256 cubic kilometers of carbon dioxide. The water temperature is 24°C, and the pH level is about 8.6. The methane is reported to be produced by microbial reduction of the volcanic CO2. A future overturn and <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> from the deep waters of Lake Kivu would result in catastrophe, dwarfing the historically documented lake overturns at Lakes Nyos and Monoun. The lives of the approximately two million {{people who live in the}} lake basin area would be in jeopardy.|$|E
40|$|A 117. 8 L {{three-dimensional}} {{pressure vessel}} {{is used to}} study the methane hydrate dissociation with the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) method. It is called the Pilot-Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS). This study proposes the evaluation and the comparisons of the gas production performance by SAGD method from the methane hydrate reservoir with different steam injection rates. It indicates that the experiment could be divided into three main stages: the original <b>gas</b> <b>releasing</b> stage, the original and the hydrate-originating <b>gas</b> <b>releasing</b> stage, and the hydrate-originating <b>gas</b> <b>releasing</b> stage (the SAGD process). Furthermore, the temperature change consists of the four periods: decreasing dramatically, keeping stable, rising gradually, and keeping steady. With the injected steam flowing downwards and sideways, the steam chamber is expanding. The gas production rate increases with the steam injection rate, while the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) and gas-to-water ratios are improved by the decrease of the steam injection rate.

30|$|The {{volume of}} <b>gas</b> (x) <b>released</b> after {{depressurization}} {{can be measured}} from the GOR obtained from a conventional differential liberation PVT test shown in Fig.  7. During this test, {{the oil and gas}} are under equilibrium conditions. Thus, the <b>gas</b> <b>released</b> is the maximum quantity at every pressure. For the unconventional differential liberation PVT test, the volume of the <b>released</b> <b>gas</b> existing as free gas bubbles (y) can be measured. Therefore, the volume of gas entrained in foamy oil can be estimated by subtracting the <b>released</b> <b>gas</b> (y) during an unconventional differential liberation PVT test from the volume of <b>gas</b> (x) <b>released</b> in a conventional differential liberation PVT test. The initial concentration of gas in saturated oil shown in Eq. (3) can be determined by the conventional differential liberation PVT test (Wang et al. 2012; Mohammad et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013 a).|$|R

25|$|The {{most likely}} {{sources of the}} CO2 are {{degassing}} of intruded magma and <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> from limestone-rich metasedimentary rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the CO2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along faults to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support {{the theory that the}} gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole. There is evidence that the rate of CO2 discharge has been declining, with emissions peaking in 1991.|$|E

500|$|In {{support of}} the {{outgassing}} hypothesis, data from the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer indicate the recent outgassing of radon to the surface. In particular, results show that radon gas was emanating from {{the vicinity of the}} craters Aristarchus and Kepler during the time of this two-year mission. [...] These observations could be explained by the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events. In support of explosive outgassing, {{it has been suggested that}} a roughly 3km- (1.9mi-) diameter region of the lunar surface was [...] "recently" [...] modified by a <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> event.

500|$|There {{has been}} {{historical}} controversy over whether {{features on the}} Moon's surface change over time.

However, outgassing does occasionally occur, and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} a roughly [...] diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> event about a million years ago. The Moon's appearance, like that of the Sun, can be affected by Earth's atmosphere: common effects are a 22° halo ring formed when the Moon's light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus cloud, and smaller coronal rings when the Moon is seen through thin clouds.|$|E
