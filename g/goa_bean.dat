50|$|The {{winged bean}} (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), {{also known as}} the <b>Goa</b> <b>bean,</b> four-angled bean, four-cornered bean, Manila bean, Dragon bean, is a {{tropical}} legume plant native to New Guinea.|$|E
40|$|Phenolic acids {{have been}} {{identified}} in a variety of legumes including lima bean, broad bean, common bean, pea, jack bean, <b>goa</b> <b>bean,</b> adzuki bean, hyacinth bean, chicking vetch, garbanzo bean, dral, cow bean, rice bean, mung bean and soybean. The present study was carried out with the following aims: (1) to identify and quantify the individual phenolic acid and determine the total phenolic content (TPC); (2) to assess their antioxidant activity, inhibition activities of α-glucosidase, tyrosinase, and formation of advanced glycation endproducts; and (3) to investigate correlations among the phytochemicals and biological activity. Common bean possesses the highest antioxidant activity and advanced glycation endproducts formation inhibition activity. Adzuki bean has the highest α-glucosidase inhibition activity, and mung bean has the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity. There are significant differences in phytochemical content and functional activities among the bean species investigated. Selecting beans can help treat diseases such as dermatological hyperpigmentation illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases...|$|E
