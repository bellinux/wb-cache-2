25|$|Méhul's main musical {{concern was}} that {{everything}} should serve to increase the dramatic impact. As his admirer Berlioz wrote: was fully convinced that in truly dramatic music, when {{the importance of the}} situation deserves the sacrifice, the composer should not hesitate as between a pretty musical effect that is foreign to the scenic or dramatic character, and a series of accents that are true but do not yield any surface pleasure. He was convinced that musical expressiveness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> flower, delicate and rare, of exquisite fragrance, which does not bloom without culture, and which a breath can wither; that it does not dwell in melody alone, but that everything concurs either to create or destroy it – melody, harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation, the choice of deep or high registers for the voices or instruments, a quick or slow tempo, and the several degrees of volume in the sound emitted.|$|E

[...] Cheryl Hunter of the Hartford Courant [...] said that [...] "It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band."

In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened.

500|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the election, the Heart of Uptown Coalition and a Shiller {{supporter}} who was director of the Center for Street People, 4455 N. Broadway, organized a voter registration drive that registered 80 homeless people using the Center's address, and on election day fed them a meal at a local church hall and helped them vote. Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People's spokesman explained [...] "We think Jerry Orbach <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> man, but he doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the development...If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. We decided that Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement." [...] Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People's construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987 Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.|$|E

Most notoriously, Prince Charles described the building in 1988 as [...] "a clever way of building a nuclear power station in the middle of London without anyone objecting". Sir John Betjeman, however, a man not noted for his enthusiasm for brutalist architecture, was effusive in his praise and wrote to Lasdun stating that he [...] "gasped with delight at the cube of your theatre in the pale blue sky and a glimpse of St. Paul's to the south of it.

Norbury said that although Riley feels Lynsey <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely</b> girl and someone he can have a laugh with, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) is a better match for Riley. Hassan felt that her alter-ego is happy to keep things a secret between her and Riley although when Mitzeee discovers the relationship Lynsey is on the [...] "receiving end of a lot of jealousy". Hassan explained that although Lynsey does not want to go head-to-head with Mercedes and Mitzeee, she will not step aside either.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Broadchurch series one {{was shot}} on location, which the {{producers}} felt would heighten the reality and intimacy of the series. Location shooting was also {{important because the}} Dorset coast was integral to setting {{the mood of the}} drama. Director James Strong said the goal was to make Broadchurch [...] "look and feel different", [...] "a world that was recognisable but in subtle extremis—an ordinary seaside town where events have upset the natural order of life. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lovely,</b> beautiful place where something terrible has happened." [...] Strong chose a visual style that emphasised contradictory elements, such as privacy and publicity, the natural and unnatural, or water and fire. Another part of the visual style was to connect the characters to the Dorset landscape. To achieve this, locations were chosen which would allow the characters to bring their private behaviors outside. A third element of the visual style was to use the change in seasons to help illuminate the way the emotional tenor of the drama changes during the series.|$|E
2500|$|While still a student, Ashcroft {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in {{a revival of}} J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus opposite Ralph Richardson, {{with whom she had}} been greatly impressed when she saw him in Charles Doran's touring company while she was still a schoolgirl. She graduated from the Central School in 1927 with London University's Diploma in Dramatic Art. Never much drawn to the West End or stardom, she learned her craft with mostly small companies in fringe theatres. Her first notable West End role was Naemi in Jew Süss in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing. In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor, later a well-known publisher. He later described the marriage as [...] "a sad failure: we were much too young to know what we wanted... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps {{once or twice a year}} in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago.

[...] David arrived to screens with the producers intending to expand upon his family. He was said to have a [...] "secret", which was later revealed to be a runaway homeless son. A minor character named Fergus (Paul Ellis), who had appeared in several episodes in late 1995, impressed producers and he was rewritten so as to be David's estranged son. In 1999, Elliott was axed from the soap. He was [...] "outraged" [...] and [...] "upset", but later was happy to have had the ability to work in other roles.
