5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating that he <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the Korea bill {{because it did}} not include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{forces were}} to be demobilized as soon as {{possible}} and the federal forces {{were to be}} the only army in Mexico. This was in order to appease the army, which <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> a compromise with Madero.|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of}} the 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{defeated}} Sawyer in the primary. In the 1989 general election, Daley faced Republican candidate Edward Vrdolyak, {{a former}} Democratic alderman who <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> Mayor Washington, and Alderman Timothy C. Evans, {{the candidate of}} the newly created Harold Washington Party. After winning the general election on April 4, 1989, Daley was inaugurated as Mayor of Chicago on April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday, at a ceremony in Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed {{well away from}} the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E

5|$|On June 8, 1844, after fierce {{partisan}} struggles, the Senate {{rejected the}} Tyler–Texas treaty {{by a vote}} of 35–16, a margin of more than two-to-one. The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15–8). Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation {{at the center of the}} 1844 general election.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Concord, Pierce {{resumed his}} law work; in one notable case he defended the {{religious}} liberty of the Shakers, the insular sect {{who were being}} threatened with legal action over accusations of child abuse. His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E
5|$|The citadel was {{not used}} during the rule of Gia Long and the only {{military}} action occurred after his son had ascended the throne as Minh Mạng. Years of tension between the monarch and General Lê Văn Duyệt, the governor of southern Vietnam, {{came to a head}} after the death of the latter in 1831. Tension between the pair surfaced when Gia Long made Minh Mang the heir to the throne. Duyet <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the succession, favouring the enthronement of a young son of the late Prince Cảnh, the eldest of Gia Long's sons.|$|E

5|$|The {{commanders of}} the army (including Stephen Bocskai), and Friar Carillo jointly {{convinced}} Sigismund to return on 8August. They also persuaded him to order the arrest of Kovacsóczy, Kendi, Balthasar Báthory, and twelve other noblemen who <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> {{the war against the}} Ottomans on 28August, accusing them of plotting. Sándor and Gábor Kendi were beheaded along with two other members of the royal council; Balthasar Báthory, Kovacsóczy, and Ferenc Kendi were strangled in prison. All but one murdered noblemen were Protestants, mostly Unitarians. Many of their relatives converted to Catholicism to prevent the confiscation of their estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery consisted of twelve 6-inch (15.2cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure. These guns were chosen because the 4-inch (10.2cm) guns on earlier battleships were {{deemed to be}} too weak and have too short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer, more powerful torpedoes. Admiral Jackie Fisher <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the idea of increasing the {{secondary battery}}, though {{he retired from the}} post of First Sea Lord in 1910. As a result, the Iron Dukes, which were designed in 1911, received the larger 6inch gun.|$|E
5|$|Travers also {{visited the}} home of Thomas Crozier, hoping to meet with him, but the latter {{did not come to}} the door. He {{presently}} resides near Craigavon. James McDowell lives in Lurgan, and John James Somerville became an evangelical minister in Belfast. The UVF had cut all ties with Somerville after he <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the 1994 ceasefire. In January 2015 he was found dead in his Shankill Road flat. Aged 70, he died of cancer of the kidney.|$|E

5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, {{concerned that}} it would make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge's {{first act}} as {{secretary}} {{was to meet}} with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst <b>had</b> <b>opposed</b> a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E
