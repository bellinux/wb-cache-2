50|$|A total {{harmonic}} <b>distortion</b> <b>analyzer</b> calculates {{the total}} harmonic {{content of a}} sinewave with some distortion, expressed as total harmonic distortion (THD). A typical application {{is to determine the}} THD of an amplifier by using a very-low-distortion sinewave input and examining the output. The figure measured will include noise, and any contribution from imperfect filtering out of the fundamental frequency. Harmonic-by-harmonic measurement, without wideband noise, can be measured by a more complex wave analyser.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{products}} from HP, Wandell & Goltermann, Radford, Marconi, Sound Technology, and Amber continued to refine measurement capabilities from the 1950s through the 1970s, but {{the model of}} usage remained relatively constant; signal generators and analyzers were separate pieces of equipment, and testing involved careful tuning of each one by a person with high technical skills. This changed in 1980 {{with the introduction of}} the Tektronix AA501 <b>Distortion</b> <b>Analyzer,</b> which automated the processes of setting levels, frequency tuning and nulling. At this same time Hewlett-Packard introduced the popular HP8903B, which combined a high quality signal generator and analyzer in a single unit.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of laser}} {{radiation}} in atmospheric communication systems is revealing {{new forms of}} signal degradation not previously encountered with lower frequency transmitting sources. The coherence and directivity of the laser {{which is responsible for}} its increased signal capacity is degraded by the effect of atmospheric distortion. Random fluctuations in the index of refraction (turbulence), Rayleigh scattering, aerosol scattering and other atmospheric effects create fluctuations (boiling, breathing, dancing, attenuation, transit-time dispersion, etc.) within the beam cross section, which when received produce random fluctuations in the receiver output signal. The two systems which are described, are designed to investigate the effect of atmospheric distortions on the amplitude and phase (or transit time) of the laser beam. The Scintillation System was designed for real-time determination of amplitude scintillation statistics. The system will be incorporated into a multi-wavelength, multi-range experiment for comparison of theoretical and experimental meteorological and optical data. The system includes a laser transmitter, an atmospheric path over which the beam is allowed to diverge to a three-foot cross section, a pair of photomultipliers with variable spacing and small sampling apertures, an analog 2 ̆ 2 scintillation computer, 2 ̆ 2 and a recording device. The scintillation computer is a real time, special purpose, analog computer designed to compute the variance and covariance of log amplitude, the probability distribution of log amplitude, and the frequency spectrum of the amplitude scintillation. The system permits the recording of these data as a function of transmitter and receiver aperture, and time. The Short Pulse Distortion System is designed to detect pulse distortion due to transit-time dispersion of the laser beam. The system includes a mode-locked laser (i. e., the optical short pulse generator), a large transmitting aperture (a Cassegrainian telescope), the atmospheric path, a wideband receiver, a sampling oscilloscope, the 2 ̆ 2 Pulse <b>Distortion</b> <b>Analyzer,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and a high-quality tape recorder. The Pulse <b>Distortion</b> <b>Analyzer</b> is designed to compare the transmitted pulses to recorded reference pulses and to detect differential area due to time dispersion. The analyzer includes a novel, feed forward, automatic gain control circuit which utilizes a linear photo detector and an analog divider to smooth a 300 Hz signal with a 100 microsecond response time. This is necessary to smooth out the signal amplitude fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence effects. Both systems have been set up and tested on a one-mile path between the Oregon Graduate Center and Skyline Drive in Portland Oregon, using a 6328 Å He-Ne Laser. The ultimate use of the scintillation computer will be in a multi-wave-length experiment conducted for the Office of Naval Research, and will utilize a uniform, meteorologically instrumented path for comparison with theoretical predictions. The Pulse Distortion System will be incorporated into a joint experiment with the Electro-optic Organization of Sylvania Electronic Systems, Inc., Mountain View, California, to be conducted over a seven-mile path...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} reliable sources used for audio test was the first product made by Hewlett-Packard in 1939, the HP200A audio oscillator. The clever and inexpensive design of the HP200A allowed testers to generate very high quality, low distortion sine waves {{that could be used}} for testing. This was followed by the company's introduction of the HP320A and HP320B <b>Distortion</b> <b>Analyzers</b> in 1941.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} {{description of the}} response of weakly nonlinear systems to second-order memory mechanisms. Our description {{is based on a}} time-varying gain-mod-ulation function. We show that intermodulation (IM) products arising from interactions at baseband have phase symmetries dif-ferent from both interactions at second harmonic frequencies and gain compression and, thus, may be readily distinguished through measurement. We also demonstrate a technique for measuring and aligning the phase of IM products outside the measurement bandwidth of our instrumentation to identify contributions to memory with broad frequency response.

40|$|As the HP {{spectrum}} analyzer family adds new members, frequency range now extends from 20 Hz to 40 GHz. There are new tracking generators and a elaborated. The family is reviewed, its new additions elaborated. The {{spectrum analyzer}}'s CRT, displaying the important pa rameters, amplitude and frequency, makes the frequency domain immediately visually accessible, {{just as the}} oscillo scope gives access to the time domain (amplitude versus time). The modern spectrum analyzer, absolutely calibrated in all respects, is many instruments in one. It makes {{many of the same}} measurements as a power meter, selective volt meter, wave <b>analyzer,</b> <b>distortion</b> meter, frequency meter, and swept measuring system. More important, it displays these measurements simultaneously. If signals are complex, con taining energy at many frequencies, the analyzer can display all at once. Then, like a microscope, it can "zoom in " for...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to validate a new device dedicated to measure the light disturbances surrounding bright sources of light under different sources of potential variability. Twenty subjects {{were involved in the}} study. Light distortion was measured using an experimental prototype (light <b>distortion</b> <b>analyzer,</b> CEORLab, University of Minho, Portugal) comprising twenty-four LED arrays panel at 2 m. Sources of variability included: intrasession and intersession repeated measures, pupil size (3 versus 6 mm), defocus (þ 0. 50) correction for the working distance, angular resolution (15 deg versus 30 deg), temporal stimuli presentation, and pupil size. Size, shape, location, and irregularity parameters have been obtained. At a low speed of presentation of the stimuli, changes in angular resolution did not {{have an effect on the}} results of the parameters measured. Results did not change with pupil size. Intensity of the central glare source significantly influenced the outcomes. Examination time was reduced by 30 % when a 30 deg angular resolution was explored instead of 15 deg. Measurements were fast and repeatable under the same experimental conditions. Size and shape parameters showed the highest consistency, whereas location and irregularity parameters showed lower consistency. The system was sensitive to changes in the intensity of the central glare source but not to pupil changes in this sample of healthy subjects. This study has been funded by the FEDER through the COMPETE Program and by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology in the framework of projects PTDC/ SAU-BEB/ 098391 / 2008, PTDC/SAU-BEB/ 098392 / 2008, and the Strategic Project PEST-C/FIS/UI 607 / 2011...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} ion {{separation}} in imperfect {{fields of the}} quadrupole mass analyzer operating within the first, second, and third stability regions are applied to simulate transmission and resolution by using an analytical approach. A mathematical simulation based on statistical mechanics reveals in analytical form that the region of beam capture, i. e., the transmission, is inversely proportional to the relative values of the mass <b>analyzer</b> <b>distortions</b> to the 1. 18 th power in log scale. Otherwise, taking into account tails of peaks from unstable ion trajectories shows that the maximum attainable resolution is directly proportional {{to the number of}} cycles the ions spend in the field to the 1. 33 rd power. Because the ion current is amplitude modulated by the frequency of the alternating component of the field, transmission losses because of a parasitic modulation increase more than tenfold as the resolution and distortion increase. These losses are reduced to a minimum by applying a heterogeneous standing wave voltage to the mass analyzer with a linear distribution of amplitude along the ion transit axis. This additional standing wave increases the transmission tenfold. This procedure has the additional advantage of ion injection at zero phase in each cycle of the radiofrequency (rf) field. Experimental verification of the techniques used to avoid transmission losses caused by field distortions indicates the validity of the simulation results. The coarse approximation by means of the operating surface of electrodes in the form of rings instead of a solenoid to create a heterogeneous standing wave voltage applied to the mass analyzer with a linear distribution of amplitude along the drift axis increases the transmission by a factor of 5 compared with a traditional coupling mass filter with pre- and post-filters. Such a comparison proves the advantages of ion injection into the mass analyzer at zero phase in each cycle of an rf field. This reduces the mechanical tolerances of the mass analyzer by an order of magnitude and creates prospects for an increase in attainable resolution by using electrodes of circular profile...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of analysis techniques {{necessary for the}} quantitative, chemical surface analysis of lithium-containing solids important {{in the construction of}} high energy density batteries is presented. Electron beam damage is discovered to be the source of apparent lithium metal formation in Li(ls) XPS spectra of lithium salts. Beam Damage thresholds of Li₂O, Li₂CO₃ and Li₂SO₄ are calculated using time-dependent Auger spectra, and possible mechanisms are discussed. The variables which affect Auger quantitation are reviewed with particular emphasis on low energy transitions. Two experimental attempts at measuring the instrument response function for the cylindrical mirror analyzer and electron multiplier are discussed. Background correction techniques proposed in the literature are compared using synthesized Auger data. Auger lineshapes are synthesized by a series of calculations which mimic each step of the Auger electron's path from the atomic core level to the detector. The results indicate that the SIBS (Sequential Inelastic Background Subtraction) method is more applicable to Auger analysis because of its analytical accuracy, speed and ability to handle spectra with poor signal to noise. The special problem of low energy background subtraction is resolved {{through the use of a}} new five-parameter function which adequately accounts for the <b>analyzer</b> <b>distortions</b> and secondary cascade in one calculation. Using the above correction techniques, Auger spectra, peak energies, relative intensities and FWHM's of Li₂O, LiOHNH₂O, LiH, Li₃N, Li₂CO₃ and Li₂SO₄NH₂O are presented. Despite special handling techniques, the hydroxide, hydride and nitride reveal extensive oxidation. The oxyanion salts reveal little Li Auger intensity until substantial anion desorption had occurred. The reaction products of lithium with oxygen, water and carbon dioxide are studied by AES. Results indicate the formation of Li₂O, LiOHNH₂O and Li₂O with hydrocarbons, respectively. These results are used to construct a plausible surface structure of the Li-SO₂ interface which explains its stability to self-discharge corrosion and yet maintain electronic conductivity for external discharge. RBS and AES depth profiling are used to analyze potassium-implanted glasses. The results indicate a great deal of ionic migration for glasses which leads to a speculative mechanism for alkali corrosion of glasses...|$|R
