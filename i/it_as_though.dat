In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent {{that this is the}} man who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area.

According to Whedon [...] " [...] understood the show {{as well as any}} human being, and just brought so much to it that I think of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were always a part of it". Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, {{with the exception of the}} director of photography David Boyd, who was the [...] "big find" [...] and who was [...] "full of joy and energy".|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{is a mix}} of {{rock and}} roll and rhythm and blues with the {{original}} score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure what to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were serious. He adapted the [...] "Faber College Theme" [...] from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies.|$|E

500|$|Thus, Black {{refused to}} join in the efforts of the justices on the Court who sought to abolish capital {{punishment}} in the United States, whose efforts succeeded (temporarily) in the term immediately following Black's death. He claimed that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment's reference to takings of [...] "life", and to [...] "capital" [...] crimes, meant approval of the death penalty was implicit in the Bill of Rights. He also was not persuaded that a right of privacy was implicit in the Ninth or Fourteenth amendments, and dissented from the Court's 1965 Griswold decision which invalidated a conviction for the use of contraceptives. Black said [...] "It belittles that [...] Amendment to talk about <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it protects nothing but 'privacy'... 'privacy' is a broad, abstract, and ambiguous concept... The constitutional right of privacy is not found in the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{approach}} ultimately {{impressed the}} studio and her recording was kept, which took the singer only thirty-two minutes to complete. However, she approached <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she was performing the entire score. Although Nixon performs only one verse in the song, her musical contribution to [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] marked the singer's return to film roles following her lengthy hiatus. Mulan was also Nixon's first Disney film in 10 years; she had previously performed in the musical film Mary Poppins (1964). Nixon was eventually joined by Broadway performers Beth Fowler and Lea Salonga, although the three singers never recorded together. The studio enjoyed Nixon's performance {{so much that they}} ultimately decided to recast the actress who had been providing Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time with someone who sounded more like her, replacing her with voice actress June Foray. Disney had been considered hiring actresses Lauren Bacall and June Havoc to record [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] prior to Nixon's. The songwriters first based [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] on a rough cut they had seen of the scene; the animators eventually synced the animated characters with the singers' voices.|$|E
500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E

500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} tell them the name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E

2500|$|As Act1 progresses, Jimmy {{becomes more}} and more vituperative, {{transferring}} his contempt for Alison's family onto her personally, calling her [...] "pusillanimous" [...] and generally belittling her to Cliff. It is possible to play this scene as though Jimmy thinks everything is just a joke, but most actors opt for playing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he really is excoriating her. The tirade ends with some physical horseplay, resulting in the ironing board overturning and Alison's arm getting a burn. Jimmy exits to play his trumpet off stage.|$|E
2500|$|BPO pantomimes are {{generally}} seen more {{in young children}} (3–5 years old) and those with brain damage. There are many theories as to why BPO may be prevalent in these populations. This includes disruptions in the conceptual or temporal-spatial stages {{in the process of}} learned gestures, an impairment of conveying hand-posture of tool use, and a poor representation of an external objects. IO pantomimes are seen as much more complex than BPO pantomimes because they must have a strong mental representation of the object to be used and understood. An individual cannot garner any supportive information from the environment, and must know and understand the properties of the object to manipulate <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it is [...] in use, even though it is not physically present.|$|E

2500|$|Rachmaninoff also possessed {{an uncanny}} memory—one {{that would help}} put him in good stead {{when he had to}} learn the {{standard}} piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He could hear a piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a decade after that. Siloti would give him a long and demanding piece to learn, such as Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel. Two days later Rachmaninoff would play it [...] "with complete artistic finish." [...] Alexander Goldenweiser said, [...] "Whatever composition was ever mentioned—piano, orchestral, operatic, or other—by a Classical or contemporary composer, if Rachmaninoff had at any time heard it, and most of all if he liked it, he played <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were a work he had studied thoroughly." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is metaphorically 'twilighted' in the RGV as dhruva [...] "pole star". From {{the vantage}} of the Northern Hemisphere of Earth, the pole star is apt because {{day or night}} it is always in the sky, hence constant, {{immutable}} and fixed, but not necessarily visible. The pole star appears not to move but the heavenly bodies revolve around <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it is a fixed 'point' (Sanskrit: bindu). Just as the pole star is not truly fixed in the sky, the 'everlasting' aspect is not eternal, and should be understood as subject to the Catuṣkoṭi which is employed in the RGV. The 'essence', the 'element', the 'ratnagotra' must not be essentialized. Rather than the term 'eternal' or 'everlasting' [...] which smacks of 'eternalism' (Pali: sassatavada) anathemic to Buddhadharma, a continuum spontaneously 'self-emergent' (rang shar) is sound [...]|$|E
2500|$|To {{mitigate}} this, the MBTA {{set up a}} new {{bus line}} served by articulated buses equipped with specialized dispatching equipment, {{and a few of the}} features of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route. The MBTA named this new service the Silver Line, and classified <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were a high-capacity rail transit service, though it fails to meet full service standards for a BRT route. The Silver Line service has been criticized in many respects, most notably for its slow speed and the fact that it operates in mixed street traffic, subject to gridlock and collisions, earning it the nickname [...] "Silver Lie" [...] among some critics. A rating from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) determined that the MBTA Silver Line was best classified as [...] "Not BRT" [...] after local decision makers gradually decided to do away with most BRT-specific features.|$|E

2500|$|When Sondheim {{was about}} ten years old (around {{the time of his}} parents' divorce), he became friends with James Hammerstein, son of lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's {{surrogate}} father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theatre. Sondheim met Hal Prince, who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of South Pacific, Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers. The comic musical he wrote at George School, By George, was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem. When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: [...] "But {{if you want to know}} why it's terrible, I'll tell you." [...] They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, [...] "In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school board's {{statement}} {{asserting that}} there are [...] "gaps" [...] in evolution and that it specifically is a theory [...] "not a fact" [...] singled out evolution, implying {{it is just a}} hunch, even though this is not the actual meaning of the term [...] "scientific theory". The reference to Of Pandas and People and presentation of intelligent design as an alternative [...] "explanation of the origins of life" [...] presented <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were a scientific explanation, in contrast to the way that evolution was described. Encouraging students to [...] "keep an open mind" [...] about alternatives without offering an alternative scientific explanation implied an invitation to meditate on a religious view, endorsing the religious view in a way similar to the disclaimer found to be unconstitutional in the Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education case. The school board claimed the statement does not teach intelligent design and simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution, but no such statements were made about other subjects. As part of the presentation, the administrators stated that [...] "there will be no other discussion of the issue and your teachers will not answer questions on the issue", giving intelligent design a position not applied to scientific topics. The board denied that intelligent design was [...] "religion in disguise," [...] despite being represented in court by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian not-for-profit law center that uses litigation to promote [...] "the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values". Its stated purpose is [...] "...to be the sword and shield for people of faith".|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E
