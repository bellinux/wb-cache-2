The purpose is an analysis of government support measures for the domestic bank system; furthermore the search for additional sources of financing bank funds and the development <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> level <b>increase</b> in conditions <b>of</b> social and economic transformations. Methodology. In the research there are used general scientific methods of learning economic facts and the use of processes in their steady development and correlation: logic analysis, methods of scientific abstraction, induction, deduction, optimization, grouping and comparison, as well as graphic and tabular methods. Results. The questions of government control in the bank system in the period of the world financial crisis is researched on international level by the Financial Stability Council, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, specialists of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. As a result of relative novelty of these problems {{only a small number of}} researches is devoted to the use of government bank support instruments and therefore further development of this topic has practical value for improving the renewal mechanisms of financial stability and reliability of the bank system in Ukraine. After the analysis of the government control measures of the domestic bank capitalization, since 2009, and the effectiveness of budget resources segregation on refinancing and recapitalization of bank institutions in Ukraine (including crisis period), it was found out that these mechanisms, unfortunately, did not change much the situation on the bank market. Taking into account the unstable political situation in Ukraine and its military conflict with Russia, which has influenced the inflation growth, depreciation of the national currency and panic outflow of deposits, furthermore the forecast of an intensified bank crisis is used as confirmation to the problems with liquidity and bankruptcy of numerous groups of the domestic banks. Therefore advisable is working of a structural and logical scheme <b>of</b> banks’ <b>capitalization</b> level <b>increase,</b> which consists <b>of</b> a selection of four categories of banks after stress-testing the measures <b>of</b> obligatory <b>capitalization</b> or processes <b>of</b> amalgamation and merging: financially consistent and reliable; 2) problem; 3) insolvent; 4) bad (helpless) banks. Conclusions. Realization of problem banks’ recapitalization with participation of the government is one of the possible variants of initiatives in handling the economic crisis’ condi-tions. Nevertheless, problems with deposit-returns and debt-discharges are better to solve by refinancing and restricting their liabilities than by recapitalization. In authors’ opinion, more reasonable methods of banks’ additional capitalization-financing is attracting resources from privatization of state property and introduces new activation mechanisms of citizens savings used, particularly for converting deposits of artificial and physical bodies in hryvni and dollars into the preference shares of domestic banks...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} study in this paper is the {{scientific}} basis <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> water resources of the regions of Ukraine {{with a view to}} accumulating the capital in the regions of Ukraine and their balanced development. The problems of water management complex are conditioned, first of all, by dramatic changes of the institutional environment in the country, weakening of the system of public administration, and considerable reduction of the volume of financing of water-related activities. Critical wear of capital assets of water industry is the cause of negative consequences in the domain of water supply, and the resulting damage to the economy and population in this regard is far greater than the amount of money needed for its prevention. Methodology. We used in our study the traditional and special methods, including: historical and logical method, abstraction and analogy and system analysis methods. Results. This paper states that the problems of development of water management complex of Ukraine can be solved by taking systemic measures aimed at <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> water resources, corporatization of water sector management, and institutionalization of the market methods of management. The process <b>of</b> water resources <b>capitalization</b> will give an opportunity to transform the production factor into capital on the basis of harmonization of interests of business entities in order to ensure the sustainable development of the national territorial formations. It should be noted {{that it is necessary to}} form the cost of water resources. Study of the cost of water resources determines that today it is not possible to determine this cost in Ukraine, since the market of water resources does not actually exist, and this fact significantly restrains the development of water management complex in the economy. Practical implications. Therefore, in the current economic situation in Ukraine the necessary condition of achieving the objectives of sustainable development is the promotion of processes of the natural resources’ <b>capitalization.</b> The basis <b>of</b> inclusion of the natural potential into economic turnover should become the adequate assessment of water resources which may convert them in the form of financial capital. It is offered to introduce in the economic turnover the system of assessment of water resources based on the differential rent which can provide the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> water resources on demand of sustainable and balanced development of the regions in the conditions of integration changes. The current state of water use is characterized by inadequate mechanism of water resources’ management. In order to <b>increase</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> water resources in Ukraine it is necessary to create the mechanism of environmentally sustainable water use based on the renewed institutional environment which would promote the recovery of water resources in the form of the most productive capital. This approach will allow determining the real value and prices of water resources, enhancing their capitalization, eliminating mismanagement syndrome and free-of-charge principle for the resources from the economic turnover, and promoting development of the natural infrastructure. Value/originality. Despite the existence of studies of the problems concerning the recovery of the natural and water resources, development of the regional social and economic systems, conducted by Ukrainian and foreign researchers, the issue <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> water resources in the system of development of the regional socio-economic systems today remains a subject of scientific discussions...|$|R
