25|$|Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) {{taught in}} his widely read encyclopedia, The Etymologies, that the Earth was round. While some writers <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{referred}} to a spherical Earth; this and other writings {{make it clear that}} he considered the Earth to be disk or wheel-shaped. Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.|$|E
25|$|A partial {{exception}} was Jump for Joy, a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941, at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Hollywood luminaries such as actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney {{invested in the}} production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered to direct. At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was an entirely different character {{in the second half}} of the show.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire had {{a policy}} of not {{offering}} contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers {{by the end of}} July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E

60|$|The {{idea that}} he was not Sir Percival Glyde at all, that he had no more claim to the baronetcy and to Blackwater Park than the poorest {{labourer}} who worked on the estate, had never once occurred to my mind. At one time I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might be Anne Catherick's father--at another time I <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might <b>have</b> been Anne Catherick's husband--the offence of which he was really guilty had been, from first to last, beyond the widest reach of my imagination.|$|R
500|$|Moses Hazen {{was born}} in Haverhill, a {{frontier}} town in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, to an old New England Puritan family. [...] Some histories that mention Hazen sometimes indicate that he was Jewish. A genealogist clearly documents Hazen's lineage to England, where the family name was Hassen. [...] Contemporaries of Hazen seem to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was Jewish; [...] for example, Sergeant James Thompson, in his diary The Fraser’s Highlanders, describes meeting him during the retreat from the Battle of Sainte-Foy: [...] "On the way, I fell in with a Captain Moses Hazen, a jew".|$|E
500|$|Selected in {{the second}} round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Johnson instead played one season in Canada with the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) in 1953. Johnson {{reasoned}} that Calgary had offered more money, but Steelers owner Art Rooney speculated that Johnson thought it was too cold in Pittsburgh. [...] "He must <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was going to some resort up there," [...] joked Rooney. He led the Stampeders in rushing that season with 107 carries for 648 yards, an average of six yards per carry with five touchdowns. In addition, Johnson caught 33 passes for 365 yards and three more touchdowns, returned 47 punts for 386 yards, and had a 104-yard kickoff return touchdown. He also starred on defense and intercepted five passes. He was awarded the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. Johnson was also a leading WIFU All-Star vote receiver, but because he played both offense and defense so well voters split their votes and he was left off the team's [...] "roster".|$|E

2500|$|Victoria and Delhi Daredevils coach Greg Shipperd, {{when asked}} about Dirk's non {{selection}} for the Australian Twenty20 team, said that [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be first pick".

Growing up in a polyglot world, he displayed his mother’s gift for languages, speaking French, English, Lenape, Shawnee and the Iroquoian languages.

2500|$|Madame Montour was {{the mother}} of three children. A son, Louis, served as a {{translator}} during the French and Indian War. He was killed during the war. Her daughter, Margaret, later to be known as [...] "French Margaret" [...] {{went on to become the}} leader of [...] "French Margaret's Town" [...] an Indian settlement at the mouth of Lycoming Creek just a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Her son, Andrew, took over leadership of Otstonwakin upon her death in the late 1740s. Andrew inherited his mother’s gift for languages. He spoke French, English, Lenape, Shawnee, and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as a translator for both settlers and local tribes. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour, he wrote that Montour looked [...] "decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was one." [...] He also served as a translator with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted [...] of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He was later appointed as a captain in George Washington's army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. Andrew Montour left Montoursville at some point and moved to Juniata County before finally settling on Muntour's Island in the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh.|$|E
2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E
