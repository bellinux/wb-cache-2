25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.|$|E
25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of rectangular waveguide, {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by total internal reflection at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative dielectric waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E

2500|$|One {{difference}} between dielectric and metal waveguides {{is that at}} a metal surface the electromagnetic waves are tightly confined; at high frequencies the electric and magnetic fields penetrate a very short distance into the metal. [...] In contrast, {{the surface of the}} <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> is an interface between two dielectrics, so the fields of the wave penetrate outside the dielectric {{in the form of an}} evanescent (non-propagating) wave.|$|E
2500|$|Dielectric rod and slab waveguides {{are used}} to conduct radio waves, mostly at {{millimeter}} wave frequencies and above. [...] These confine the radio waves by total internal reflection from the step in refractive index due to the change in dielectric constant at the material surface. [...] At millimeter wave frequencies and above, metal {{is not a good}} conductor, so metal waveguides can have increasing attenuation. [...] At these wavelengths dielectric waveguides can have lower losses than metal waveguides. [...] Optical fiber is a form of <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> used at optical wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{finite-element method}} {{for the analysis}} of <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguides</b> is formulated in terms of all three components of the magnetic field H. In this approach, the spurious, nonphysical solutions do not appear anywhere above the "air-line," and therefore the present formulation is very useful {{for the analysis of}} the surface-wave modes of <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguides.</b> The application of this improved finite-element method to the <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguides</b> with perfect electric and magnetic conductors is also discussed. In particular, the discussion is how to use the conditions on a boundary surface of a perfect electric or magnetic conductor whose normal direction is not coincident with the direction of a coordinate axis. Application of these boundary conditions for perfect conductors to the <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguides</b> with planes of symmetry reduces the matrix size.

2500|$|The {{waveguide}} {{was developed}} independently between 1932 and 1936 by George C. Southworth at Bell Telephone Laboratories and Wilmer L.

[...] Southworth's interest was sparked during his 1920s doctoral work {{in which he}} measured the dielectric constant of water with a radio frequency Lecher line in a long tank of water. [...] He found that if he removed the Lecher line, the tank of water still showed resonance peaks, indicating it was acting as a <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide.</b> [...] At Bell Labs in 1931 he resumed work in dielectric waveguides.

5000|$|Making circuit {{elements}} out of transmission lines is most useful at microwave frequencies. At lower frequencies the longer wavelength makes these components too bulky. At the higher microwave frequencies planar transmission line formats are generally too lossy and waveguide is used instead. Waveguide, however, is more bulky {{and more expensive}} to manufacture. At still higher frequencies <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> (such as optical fibre) becomes the technology of choice. However, there are planar formats of <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide.</b> [...] The most widely used planar formats are stripline, microstrip, suspended stripline, and coplanar waveguide.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of the hybrid plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of mode coupling. The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a silicon nanowire placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>waveguide</b> mode supported by the silicon nanowire couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As {{a result of this}} mode coupling, light becomes highly confined in the region between the metal and the high index region (silicon nanowire).|$|E
