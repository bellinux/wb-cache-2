40|$|Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus can {{use either}} H 2 or <b>formate</b> as the {{electron}} donor for methanogenesis from CO 2. Resuspended-cell experiments {{revealed that the}} ability to use H 2 as the source of electrons for methanogenesis was constitutive; cells grown on <b>formate</b> or H 2 -CO 2 were equally capable of H 2 -CO 2 methanogenesis. The ability to metabolize <b>formate</b> at high rates was observed only in cells previously grown on <b>formate.</b> Two such strains were distinguished: strain F and strain HF. Strain F was repeatedly grown exclusively on <b>formate</b> for over 3 years; this strain showed a constitutive capacity to metabolize <b>formate</b> to methane, even after subsequent repeated transfers to medium containing only H 2 -CO 2. Strain HF could only metabolize <b>formate</b> to methane when grown in the presence of <b>formate</b> with no H 2 present; this strain was recently derived from another strain (H) that had been exclusively grown on H 2 -CO 2 and which upon initial transfer to <b>formate</b> medium could only metabolize <b>formate</b> to methane at a very slow rate. Initial adaptation of strain H to growth on <b>formate</b> was preceded by a long lag. The specific activities of hydrogenase and <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase in cell extracts derived from these different strains confirmed these findings. Similar levels of hydrogenase were observed in all strains, independent of the presence of H 2 in the growth medium medium. High levels of <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase were also constitutive in strain F. Only low <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase activities were observed in strain H. High levels of <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase were observed in strain HF only when these cells were grown with <b>formate</b> in the absence of H 2.

Growth and suspended-whole-cell experiments show that H 2 plus CO 2 methanogenesis was constitutive, while <b>formate</b> methanogenesis required adaptation time; selenium {{was necessary for}} <b>formate</b> utilization. Cells grown on <b>formate</b> had 20 to 100 times higher methanogenesis rates on <b>formate</b> than cells grown on H 2 -CO 2 and transferred into <b>formate</b> medium.

The capacity to oxidize oxalate appeared during the lag phase of 2 - 4 h after the exhaustion of <b>formate</b> and was followed by a second phase of growth on oxalate. The rate of autotrophic 14 CO 2 fixation measured in washed cell suspensions decreased markedly in this second growth phase on the addition of oxalate. In mixtures of <b>formate</b> with acetate, glyoxylate or glycollate, simultaneous utilization of both substrates was observed. During growth on acetate plus <b>formate</b> formate-oxidizing capacity remained low. With low acetate concentrations, sufficient <b>formate</b> remained after the exhaustion of acetate to support a second growth phase on <b>formate.</b> This phase followed a 1. 5 - 2 h lag, during which formate-oxidizing capacity increased and the Calvin cycle enzymes were synthesized. In mixtures of <b>formate</b> with glyoxylate or glycollate, the formate-oxidizing capacity was high, <b>formate</b> was oxidized rapidly, and no second growth phase was seen. In these latter mixtures high activities of a membrane-bound, phenazine methosulphate/ 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase and low activities of the soluble NAD-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase were detected.
