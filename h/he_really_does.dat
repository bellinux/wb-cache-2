5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira goes over to Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt wrong, {{but it is not}} his fault. She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony is not interested in Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly.

5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|Brent tells Neil {{that he has}} a {{date for}} the Christmas party, when <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> not. With Gareth's help, he {{searches}} Internet romance websites for suitable women, and lines up three possible candidates for blind dates. He takes the first to dinner, but accidentally steers the conversation to breasts. He calls from his car to arrange a meeting with the second woman (voiced by Julia Davis), who does not realise who Brent is, and mocks the manager from The Office documentary. Brent hangs up. On the third date, Brent immediately finds the woman unattractive and boring. Dawn returns to Britain and arrives at the office. She and Tim immediately recreate old times by winding up Gareth. Brent pushes Neil's patience too far when he brings his dog into the office to show to the staff. Neil bars Brent from the office and later stops anyone who does not work for Wernham Hogg from going to the Christmas dinner. At the party, Brent anxiously awaits his fourth blind date. When the woman, Carol, arrives, she and Brent hit it off straight away. Lee tells Dawn {{that it is time to}} leave. She and Tim say awkward goodbyes and she leaves with Lee.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting {{that if the}} Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him {{no more than three}} months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that [...] "Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> take a little more care and speaks a little less." [...] On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at Baveno on the shore of Lake Maggiore, with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery [...] "in 3 or 4 months," [...] wrote Victoria. Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day. At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was [...] "very hoarse again" [...] and easily became depressed about his health. General Alfred von Waldersee observed that Frederick's health had grave implications, as if William died soon and his son succeeded, [...] "a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one." [...] His son Wilhelm reported to King Albert of Saxony that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by [...] "blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx." ...|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies, Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet," [...] which followed this interview. Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman Dick Armey's spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the internet." [...] Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization.

2500|$|Prior to the campaign, Sun Quan had two boxes made to {{hold the}} heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After Huang Zu's defeat, Su Fei was also {{captured}} and he immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said, [...] "If Su Fei did not speak up, I'd have forgotten about him." [...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> that, I'm willing to use my head to replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout {{from her}} initial underwhelmed {{reaction}} upon first seeing {{a photograph of}} Pattinson, enthused; [...] "The thing that’s great about him is <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E
