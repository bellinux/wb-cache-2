40|$|International audienceThis paper studies {{investment}} behaviour for the Danish <b>demersal</b> <b>fishery</b> in the North Sea. For {{the study}} period, this fishery is regulated by variants of individual non-transferable quotas. It is shown that {{interest rates and}} capital stocks are primary determinants of investments. Another conclusion is that an aggregated model based on the whole fleet gives identical results to models based on individual fleets (disaggregated models) for trawlers and Danish Seiners. However, for netters and other vessels the aggregated and disaggregated models yield different results. In addition, the variance of the estimated parameters is lower in the disaggregated models. This result arises because vessels in the disaggregated models are more homogeneous. Furthermore, investment in machinery, electronics and vessels are governed by one year-lagged variables, while investment in gears is governed by present variables for the Danish <b>demersal</b> <b>fishery</b> in the North Sea...|$|R

A bio-economic multi-species and multi-fleet model with technical interactions is developed to examine the trade-offs between preserving Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) of every species and maintaining the economic profitability of the various fishing fleets. Different management strategies are tested and compared.

Up to now cost {{measurements}} in the Senegalese <b>demersal</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{have been}} limited to {{the assessment of the}} financial viability of fleets or the comparison between revenues of the fleet and costs of the management. But all of these works are only concerned with the financial cost of fishing activity. The ecological, economical and social costs are not taken into account. The research to be conducted will fill this gap by showing the real cost of human activities on Senegalese <b>demersal</b> <b>fisheries.</b> It will also make a link between society choices and ecosystem health by showing how public policies affect production of demersal fish and marketing practices. A new approach, based on the concept of societal cost is being developed in the ECOST project. The societal costs are all costs linked to fishing activities which may be ecological (alteration of the capacity of a system), economic (all costs linked to production, management, subsidies, and external factors) and social (the costs of poverty, social injustice, gender discrimination, food security and food safety).

40|$|In 1980 the Indonesian {{government}} {{imposed a}} ban on trawling along the Malacca Straits and off the north coast of Java, the nation's two most important fishing grounds.
