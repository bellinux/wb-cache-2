5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide {{due to a lack of}} a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be used to buy food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E

25|$|Peter {{was posted}} to British East Africa (now Kenya) as a {{corporal}} {{in charge of}} a dog unit during the Mau Mau Uprising. On 8 October 1954, while en route to Thompson Falls (now Nyahururu) in a truck with ten men of the King's African Rifles, the vehicle hit a pothole in the road and flipped over. Sitting upfront, both Randall and the driver were covered in fuel and set alight. The soldiers {{in the back of the}} truck managed to scramble free, but Randall on leaving the cab saw that the driver was unconscious and re-entered the front of the truck to drag him to safety. Once the driver came around, Peter realized that a dog was chained up inside the burning truck. Removing his clothes, he went back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> once again and released the animal.|$|E
25|$|Petrović died in {{a traffic}} {{accident}} at approximately 17:20 on June 7, 1993, {{four and a half}} months before his 29th birthday. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi truck at Denkendorf, near Ingolstadt, in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the truck driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the median barrier and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich). Seconds later, the VW Golf carrying a sleeping Petrović in the passenger seat crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> killing him and leaving the driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrović was romantically involved, and Hilal Edebal, a female Turkish basketball player, with grave injuries. It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and that Petrović was not buckled with a seatbelt.|$|E
25|$|BDR's {{original}} foray <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truck</b> Series, it {{debuted in}} 2004 at the Florida Dodge Dealers 250, where Bill Lester drove it to a sixteenth-place run. He posted just one top-ten {{that year and}} finished 22nd in points. The next season, he won two poles (back-to-back at Kansas and Kentucky), had a best finish of fifth and moved up to seventeenth in points. Lester failed to finish in the top-ten during the 2006 season and dropped to twentieth in points. Tyler Walker began the season driving the renumbered No. 36 truck full-time in 2007, with sponsorship from 360 OTC. Six races into the season, rookie Ryan Mathews replaced Walker after it was learned that Walker was suspended for violating NASCAR's substance abuse policy, and the team had lost its sponsor, 360 OTC (which wanted No. 36). Mathews, in his short season, posted two top tens, one top five, and one pole at Kentucky Speedway. Mathews then {{stepped out of the}} truck for the debut of 1995 Indianapolis 500 winner and 1997 Formula One Champion Jacques Villeneuve. In preparation for this, the truck was renumbered No. 27, which Villeneuve used in his 1995 CART and Indy 500 championship season, as a tribute to his father Gilles.|$|E

500|$|In March 1993 an Iveco {{tipper truck}} was stolen in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, and repainted from white to dark blue. A 1 tonne ANFO bomb {{made by the}} IRA's South Armagh Brigade had been smuggled into England and {{was placed in the}} truck, hidden {{underneath}} a layer of tarmac. At about 9am on 24 April, two volunteers from an IRA active service unit drove the truck containing the bomb onto Bishopsgate. They parked the truck outside 99 Bishopsgate, which was then the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, located by the junction with Wormwood Street and Camomile Street, and left the area in a car driven by an accomplice. A series of telephone warnings were then sent from a phonebox in Forkhill, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, with the caller using a recognised IRA codeword and stating [...] " [...] a massive bomb… clear a wide area". The first warnings were sent about one hour before the bomb detonated. Two police officers were already making inquiries <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> when the warnings were received, and police began evacuating the area.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jason Autry, {{he agreed}} to help Zach dispose of the body. They drove to a spot along the Tennessee River with plans to [...] "gut" [...] her so she didn't float to the top. After {{unloading}} her body from {{the bed of the}} truck, they realized she was still alive, so Zach shot her {{in the back of the}} head. Fearing that the noise of the gunshot may attract attention, they loaded her body back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and Zach dropped Jason off. Autry testified that Zach later said that he'd dumped the body near a place called Kelly Ridge. (Her remains were found in a different location and it is unclear how the body ended up where it was ultimately found.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{team had}} two effects with {{vehicles}} {{that did not}} perform as originally planned. The first, in [...] "Rush", involved a scene where Pete and Chloe intentionally drive their car off a cliff and Clark speeds in to catch it before it hits the ground. To attain the shot of Clark catching Pete’s car required the crew to suspend the car from a crane with Sam Jones III and Allison Mack inside the car. The scene was filmed in a rock quarry, as {{there are not many}} cliffs in the Vancouver area, with segments of the scene created digitally. The car was then filmed as it was being pulled into the air backwards—the footage was then reverse {{to give the impression that}} it was falling. Initially, Mike Walls and his crew tried to pull the car straight up, but it was not working. The movement of the car had to be tweaked to give a sense of reality. In the season finale, Jonathan and Martha crash their truck on their way home after an EMP blast, which Clark caused, sends a shock wave out that downs a telephone pole and their truck hits it. In order to get the Kent truck to roll for the moment where Jonathan and Martha encounter the wave of EMP, two stunt drivers drove the truck toward a collapsed telephone pole, skidding into it. Then, with mannequins in the truck for safety, the effects team wrapped some cables around the truck and launched it off a ratchet to make it roll. Unfortunately, this did not go as smoothly as planned the first time, as the telephone pole did not fall when they set off the explosive charge to break it. Since it would be too hard to strap John Schneider and Annette O'Toole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> while it is upside down, and too dangerous to flip the truck with them already in it, Mike Walls and his team built a rotating truck seat, which allowed them to strap Schneider and O’Toole in, then rotate the seat so that they are upside down and slide that into the overturned truck.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{the train}} began to move. Fortunately, {{at the spot}} where it drew up, a group of their acquaintances were {{clustered}} together, and these all managed to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> which was speedily filled up until there was scarce standing-room. Three minutes later the train moved on. A great number were left behind, although everyone made as much room as possible, women especially being helped in after the trucks seemed absolutely choke-full. As soon as the train was fairly in motion many of the men climbed up on to the roofs of the covered waggons, thereby relieving the pressure below, and enabling all the women to sit down. Others ranged themselves along the sides, sitting on the rail, and so minimizing the space they occupied. But even with all this, the women were packed inconveniently together. All, however, were so much pleased at their good fortune in having got away that there was no complaining or grumbling. That the journey would be a long one, all knew; but at least they had started, and would soon be a free people in a free country.
