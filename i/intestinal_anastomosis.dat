40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar a eficácia dos adesivos de fibrina e cianoacrilato como coadjunvantes nas anastomoses de intestino delgado de coelhos. MÉTODOS: Oitenta coelhos, linhagem Nova Zelândia, machos, adultos, foram submetidos a enterectomia de 3 cm e enterorrafia e distribuídos em quatro grupos: Grupo A (dois pontos eqüidistantes); Grupo B (quatro pontos eqüidistantes); Grupo C (seis pontos eqüidistantes); Grupo D (oito pontos eqüidistantes). No 14 º dia de observação, os animais foram submetidos a uma laparotomia mediana para estudo macroscópico da cavidade {{abdominal}} para identificação e avaliação de aderências, deiscências e/ou fístulas. O segmento intestinal anastomosado foi retirado e feito um molde de alginato para posterior avaliação do índice de estenose. As peças retiradas foram processadas para estudo histológico e avaliação de fibras colágenas, macrófagos, neovascularização e granuloma tipo corpo estranho. RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença significante na avaliação de deiscência e fístulas com os dois adesivos entre os quatros sub-grupos. A aderência ocorreu em maior número nos sub-grupos do adesivo sintético. O índice de estenose foi maior nos animais do adesivo sintético somente nos sub-grupos com dois e oito pontos. A análise histológica mostrou que em todos os parâmetros avaliados (macrófago, neovascularização e granuloma) não houve diferença significante entre os dois tipos de adesivos. Em relação a porcentagem de colágeno verificou-se que houve diferença significante somente no grupo B em que o adesivo sintético foi menor que o biológico. CONCLUSÃO: O adesivo biológico de fibrina mostra mais eficácia que o adesivo sintético como complemento de suturas nas anastomoses intestinais. PURPOSE: The aim of {{the research}} was to verify the efficacy of the fibrin or cianoacrylate glue as coadjuvant in the <b>intestinals</b> <b>anastomosis</b> of rabbits. METHODS: Eighty rabbits, lineage New Zealand, males, adults, were submitted to enterectomy of 3 cm and enteroraphy distributed in four groups: Group A (two equidistants stitches); Group B (four equidistants stitches); Group C (six equidistants stitches); Group D (eight equidistants stitches). In 14 days of observation, the animals were submitted to median laparotomy for macroscopic study of the abdominal cavity for identification and evaluation of adherence, dehiscence and fistula. The segment anastomosed was removed and was maked mould of alginate for later evaluation of the index of stenosis. The parts removed were processed for histological study and evaluation of collagen, macrofages, vessels and granulomas. RESULTS: Significant difference was not presented in the evaluation of dehiscence and fistula with the two adhesives between the four subgroups. The adherence occurred in higher number in the subgroups of the synthetical adhesive. The index of stenosis was higher in the animals of the synthetical adhesive only in the subgroups with two and eight stitches. The histological analysis showed that in all the parameters evaluated (macrofages, vessels and granulomas) did not present significant difference between the two kinds of adhesives.

Design: A retrospective case matched study was conducted at Mansoura university hospital, dep. of surgery, Mansoura, Egypt. Setting: Patients who presented at the emergency department in the period from April 2009 through June 2011 with peritonitis were included in this study, 30 patients of the 1 st group were matched to a control group for age, gender, weight, diagnosis, method of anastomosis and comorbidity. Subjects: The study included 60 patients who underwent <b>intestinal</b> resection and <b>anastomosis</b> for different reasons. Interventions: <b>Intestinal</b> resection and <b>anastomosis</b> was done with seromuscular flap inforcement (1 st group), or without (2 nd group). Main Outcome measures: The primary endpoints were to assess the incidence of anastomotic leak or fistula, the length of postoperative hospital stay, and mortality. Results: The flap creation make the operative time slightly longer with mean 25. 3 minutes (P< 0. 006), however, the 1 st group had significant less incidence of leak (P< 0. 008), and consequently less postoperative complications (P< 0. 002) e. g. wound infection, wound disruption, and shorter hospitalization time (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} is to compare primary repair vs intestinal resection in cases of intestinal typhoid perforations. In addition, we hypothesised the usefulness of laparostomy for the early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} complications. Methods: 111 patients with acute peritonitis underwent emergency laparotomy: number of perforations, distance of perforations from the ileocaecal valve, and type of surgery performed were recorded. A laparostomy was then created and explored every 48 to 72 hours. The patients were then divided into two groups according to the surgical technique adopted at the initial laparotomy: primary repair (Group A) or <b>intestinal</b> resection with <b>anastomosis</b> (Group B). Clinical data, intraoperative findings, complications and mortality were evaluated and compared for each group. Results: In 104 / 111 patients we found intestinal perforations, multiple in 47. 1 % of patients. 75 had primary repair (Group A) and 26 had <b>intestinal</b> resection with <b>anastomosis</b> (Group B). Group B patients had more perforations than patients in Group A (p = 0. 0001). At laparostomy revision, the incidence of anastomotic dehiscence was greater than that of primary repair dehiscence (p = 0. 032). The incidence of new perforations was greater in Group B than in Group A (p = 0. 01). Group B correlates with a higher morbility and with a higher number of laparostomy revisions than Group A (p = 0. 005). There was no statistical difference in terms of mortality between Group A and Group B. Presence of pus in the abdominal cavity at initial laparotomy correlates with significantly higher mortality (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions: Resection and anastomosis shows greater morbidity than primary repair. Laparostomy revision makes it possible to rapidly identify new perforations and anastomotic or primary repair dehiscences; although this approach may seem aggressive, the number of operations was greater in patients who had a favourable outcome, and does not correlate with mortality...|$|R

40|$|Feline {{gastrointestinal}} adenocarcinomas are {{the most}} common nonhematopoietic gastrointestinal tumors in cats. They are highly malignant tumors causing intestinal obstruction due to the annular, stenosing nature to their growth. Current literature is largely based on surveys of pathology records.

40|$|Background: Ischemic {{conditions}} in the intestine result in deterioration of anastomosis healing process. In this study, {{our aim was to}} evaluate the possible effects of intraperitoneal nitroglycerin on the <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> healing and anastomosis burst pressures in rats with ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R). Materials and Methods: Fifty four Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups. In the first two groups, the rats underwent I/R. In the Group 1, the rats had normal saline (S) and in Group 2, the rats had nitroglycerin (N) injection. In the 3 rd and 4 th groups, an <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> was made at the 10 cm proximally to the ileocecal valve. In Group 3, S and in Group 4, N were injected. In Group 5, the rats received I/R, <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> and intraperitoneal S injection. I/R, <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> and intraperitoneal N injection were made in Group 6 rats. All nitroglycerin (50 ΅g/kg) injections were made at postoperative days of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 consecutively. On the sixth day, all rats were killed. In all rats with anastomosis, anastomotic burst pressure (ABP) was measured. Histopathological specimens were collected from all rats and evaluated under light microscopy. Results: Serious tissue damage was only detected in the Group 1 histopathologically (8 rats had grade 4 damage). In Group 2, there was a decrease in tissue damage according to histopathologic examination (5 rats had grade 1 damage). The effect onto the healing was similar in S and N groups. Nitroglycerin was noted to {{have a positive effect on}} collagen production. Nitroglycerin increased the ABP levels in rats both with and without I/R (the means are 17. 93, 21. 10, 14. 67, and 17. 63 in Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Conclusion: I/R may weaken the strength of <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis.</b> Intraperitoneal application of nitroglycerin may prevent the histopathologic changes within a limited degree.

40|$|The changes {{occurring}} in the medullary sinus and medullary cord of the parathymic lymph nodes were studied in rats after performing a small <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis.</b> Polymorphonuclear leucocytes and eosinophils were phagocytosed by the macrophages of the medullary sinus. The sinus macrophages stained strongly for acid phosphatase and weakly for non-specific esterase. The medullary sinus macrophages were most numerous near the subcapsular sinus. After a small <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> the sinus macrophages increased in size and in number. The macrophages of the medullary cord differed {{from those of the}} medullary sinus both histochemically and ultrastructurally. The cord macrophages stained weakly for acid phosphatase, stained strongly for non-specific esterase and phagocytosed plasma cells, particularly in those specimens 2 and 5 days after the <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis.</b> There was an initial significant decrease in IgA plasma cells at 2 days after the anastomosis but a subsequent increase in IgG and IgM plasma cells. The increase in IgM plasma cells preceded that of the other plasma cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{localised}} acute inflammation, {{produced by a}} small <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> on the effluent lymph of the gastrointestinal tract and on the efferent lymph of the mesenteric lymph glands has been studied in rats. There is a progressive increase in the output of lymph from the gastrointestinal tract in rats with an intact anastomosis, but a decreased output in animals with a disrupted anastomosis causing either generalised peritonitis or a localised para-anastomotic abscess. The total white cell output is increased {{on the second day}} after constructing an intact <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> and this increase is principally due to neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocyte response is prolonged, but has returned to normal values at four weeks. Although the output of cells of the mononuclear phagocytic series which are esterase positive is increased it is not statistically significant. An intact anastomosis does not produce any alteration in the lymphocyte output. The neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocyte response to an <b>intestinal</b> <b>anastomosis</b> is decreased by a factor of two and the non-lymphocytic non-specific esterase positive cell response is decreased by a factor of six by the mesenteric lymph glands which may be functioning in a 'filtering' capacity dealing with agents originating at the anastomosis and noxious to the body...|$|E
40|$|Background: Classical duplications {{may present}} along {{any part of}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GIT) from mouth to anus. Atypical or unusual rare varieties of GIT duplications may also occur, but with different anatomical features. Materials and Methods: We reviewed our 5 -year record (February 2008 -January 2013) to describe clinical profile of unusual GIT duplications in neonates and small infants. Results: Three patients with atypical variety of GIT duplications were managed in our department during this tenure. Two were females and one male. Age was ranged between 11 days and 2 months. All patients presented with massive abdominal distension causing respiratory embarrassment in two of them. In all patients, the pre-operative differential diagnoses also included GIT duplication cysts. Computerized tomography (CT) scan showed single huge cyst in one and multiple cysts in two patients. In one patient the CT scan also depicted a thoracic cyst in relation to posterior mediastinum. At operation, one patient had colonic tubular duplication cyst along with another isolated duplication cyst, the second case had a tubular duplication cyst of ileum with its segmental dilatation, and in the third case two isolated duplications were found. Duplication cysts were excised along with mucosal stripping in one patient, cyst excision and <b>intestinal</b> resection and <b>anastomosis</b> in one patient, and only cysts excision in one. All patients did well post-operatively. Conclusion: We presented unusual GIT duplications. These duplications are managed on similar lines as classical duplications with good prognosis when dealt early...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe small {{intestine}} {{is a frequent}} site of melanoma metastases and {{the most common cause}} of secondary intestinal tumors. Even though, its presentation with intestinal obstruction due to intussusception is very rare. We present a 47 -year-old woman with a medical history of facial melanoma operated 17 years ago and recently diagnosed of cervical recurrence who complained of abdominal pain of one week duration accompanied with vomiting and abdominal distension. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed marked distension of the {{small intestine}} with features suggesting intussusception of the distal ileum. At laparoscopic exploration a massive ileocolic intussusception was found with invagination of the last 60 cm of ileum inside the cecum and ascending colon. Surgical reduction revealed a tumor of approximately 2 cm in the distal end of the intussuscepted intestine acting as the lead point. Resection of non-viable ileum along with the tumor and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Many other lesions of smaller size were found distantly in the proximal small bowel but were not treated. The patient had a full recovery and was discharged three days after surgery. Pathological examination showed metastatic melanoma and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed disseminated disease with brain metastasis. The patient died three months after surgery. Intestinal occlusion due to metastatic disease is a rare condition but should be taken into account particularly in patients with history of cancer. Surgical intervention with a mini-invasive laparoscopic approach is feasible. <b>Intestinal</b> resection and <b>anastomosis</b> is mandatory for either curative or palliative intentions providing a satisfactory treatment...|$|R
30|$|This {{longitudinal}} cohort {{follow-up study}} was conducted between November 2004 and October 2007 at the Endoscopy Unit of the Woman's Health University Center, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, and comprised 347 PCO patients scheduled for LOD as a treatment option for clomiphene resistance on maximal dosing (150  mg daily for 5  days, starting on day 2) [14]. The diagnosis of PCOS {{was based on the}} clinical and biochemical evidence of androgen excess and PCO picture on transvaginal ultrasonography following the Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group sonographic description [15]. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine. All patients gave a clear written consent to participate in this study. Preoperative thorough history taking and careful general and abdominal examinations were done in all cases. Other factors of infertility were within normal including semen analysis, hysterosalpingography, normal serum prolactin, and thyroid hormones. Patients with evidence of general or local abdominal contraindications to laparoscopy were excluded from this study (four cases) due to previous <b>intestinal</b> resection <b>anastomosis</b> in two cases, extensive abdominal incisions in one case, and congestive heart failure in one case. Additional exclusion criteria were a history of pelvic surgery (16 patients); occurrence of intraoperative complications (three cases), i.e., unusual ovarian surface or ovarian ligament bleedings necessitating excessive diathermy hemostasis or suturing; postoperative pelvic infection or hematoma as diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography (one case); or non-use of prophylactic antibiotics (two cases). Moreover, 75 cases were excluded from the study, as the intraoperative panoramic screening revealed concurrent pelvic adhesions (33 cases), typical or atypical endometriosis (21 cases), small simple ovarian cysts (nine cases), and paraovarian or paratubal cysts (12 cases). The remaining 246 cases were subjected to bilateral LOD, utilizing standard triple puncture technique only done by the authors mainly the first one. All surgeons were instructed to strictly follow microsurgical principles [16] in the form of minimizing tissue trauma particularly surface ovarian burn induced by the secondary coagulation, drilling of the antimesentric surface only, firing the electrode after surface penetration using fine needles only for 5  s, with a current at a 30 -W power setting to make a puncture that was approximately 4  mm in diameter and 6 – 8  mm deep, meticulous hemostasis, proper suction–irrigation of the pelvis, and leaving 500 – 1, 000  cc of lactated ringer’s solution intraperitoneally {{at the end of the}} procedure. The numbers of drills was tailored according to the ovarian size, with a range of four to six drills per ovary. All operations were done in nearly the same manner. Preoperatively, all patients received prophylactic antibiotics and were discharged within few hours after the procedure.|$|R
