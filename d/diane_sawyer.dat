5000|$|During <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer's</b> {{interview}} of him, Gibson said:I {{wanted it to}} be shocking; and I {{wanted it to be}} extreme ... So that they see the enormity — the enormity of that sacrifice; to see that someone could endure that and still come back with love and forgiveness, even through extreme pain and suffering and ridicule. The actual crucifixion was more violent than what was shown on the film, but I thought no one would get anything out of it.|$|R
50|$|In December 2009, ABC News {{president}} David Westin offered Stephanopoulos <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer's</b> job on Good Morning America after Sawyer {{was named}} anchor of World News.

500|$|Among the {{transgender}} {{celebrities who}} publicly {{responded to the}} incident were Janet Mock, Andreja Pejić, and Laverne Cox, while the musician Ray Toro released a song, [...] "For The Lost And Brave", in dedication to Alcorn. Jill Soloway, the writer of television show Transparent, dedicated her Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series to Alcorn. During <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer's</b> interview with Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce), which confirmed Jenner's transgender identity, Alcorn was mentioned by name and the message [...] "Fix society.

This move was similar to a 1989 incident on CBS' 60 Minutes when a story on Richard Petty intending to air on the show in the weeks before the Daytona 500 was cancelled following reporter <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer's</b> defection to ABC.

500|$|The video premiered in {{the summer}} of 1995, on MTV and BET and the next evening on ABC-TV's [...] "Primetime Live" [...] during <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer's</b> {{interview}} with Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. The interview was broadcast to approximately 64 million viewers. The video is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed pieces, Heather Phares of Allmusic described the video as a [...] "stylish, interstellar clip." [...] James Hunter of Rolling Stone called it a contemporary video, [...] "in which Michael and his sister Janet jump around like '90s fashion kids trapped in a spaceship stolen from a Barbarella film set." [...] Jim Farber called it a [...] "supercool black-and-white clip... The clip's great allure is that neither of the siblings looks quite real. While the visuals hold barely any connection to the lyric, and seem to have no clear point, the weird look captivates." [...] He was of the opinion that while Michael Jackson outshines his sister in the vocals, it is Janet Jackson who gives the better performance in the music video.|$|R
40|$|The American {{society is}} {{dominated}} by a heterosexual powerstructure with norm-filled social values. It is difficult for norm-breaking humans who live outside of the gender stereotypical social model, this includes the group of transgenders. The renowned olympic decathlon athlete Bruce Jenner, also known from the TV-series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, came out as a transgender woman in April, 2015, which aroused a great news reporting. This is a qualitative content analysis with the aim to examine <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer’s</b> depiction of Bruce Jenner during the interview in the TV-show ABC 20 / 20. Sawyer is a prominent mediaprofile in the USA and got sole rights to make the last interview with Bruce Jenner before he transitioned to become a woman. We based our method out of the symptomatic reading to understand the underlying message of the questions asked in the interview and have used Selby and Cowdery's three-stage model as an analysis tool when we created our analysis framework. Furthermore, we have applied this analysis schedule on selected key scenes that we transcribed from the interview {{in order to get}} answers to our thesis questions. The result of our thesis is that Sawyer has steered the questions asked in the interview, how they are formulated, and through it controlled the depiction of Jenner in the program. Sawyer questions to Jenner was sometimes chareterized by ignorance and prejudice for transgender, however the overall impression of the interview is that she depicted Jenner {{in a way that was}} positive and advantageous for him. ...|$|R
25|$|To improve Good Morning Americas ratings performance, which briefly fell {{to third}} {{place among the}} morning shows in January 1999, ABC News {{management}} selected Shelley Ross {{from the field of}} executive producer candidates. As part of Rossʼs proposed changes, Ross ousted the McRee-Newman team and lobbied to bring in <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer</b> and team her with Charles Gibson, who had been reluctant to return. On January 18, 1999, the Gibson-Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on-air, which during the first full season resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network news franchises saw losses.|$|E

[...] Jenner cross-dressed {{for many years and}} took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1992. Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.|$|E

During the next week, a revived {{version of the bill}} gained new life, with the potential of being passed before the winter recess. Stewart was praised by both politicians and affected first responders for the bill's passage. According to Syracuse University professor of television, radio and film Robert J.
