50|$|Livestock—-especially cattle—-may be branded to {{indicate}} ownership and age, but in modern farming, identification {{is more likely}} to be indicated by means of <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> and electronic identification, instead. Sheep are also frequently marked by means of ear marks and/or <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> As fears of BSE and other epidemic illnesses mount, the use of implants to monitor and trace animals in the food production system is increasingly common, and sometimes required by government regulations.|$|R

50|$|In 1953, {{the first}} two-piece, {{self-piercing}} plastic <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> {{was developed and}} patented. This tag, which combined the easy application of metal tags with the visibility and colour options of plastic tags, also limited the transfer of blood-borne diseases between animals during the application process.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> can {{be applied}} with an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> applicator, however there are also specially-designed tags that {{can be applied}} by hand. Depending on the purpose of the tagging, an animal may be tagged on one ear or both. There may be {{requirements}} for the placement of ear tags, and care must be taken to ensure they are not placed too close {{to the edge of the}} ear pinnae; which may leave the tag vulnerable to being ripped out accidentally. If there exists a national animal identification programme in a country, animals may be tagged on both ears for the sake of increased security and effectiveness, or as a legal requirement. [...] If animals are tagged for private purposes, usually one ear is tagged. Australian sheep and goats are required to have visually readable ear tags printed with a Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC). They are complemented by movement documents supplied by consignors that are used for identification and tracking.|$|E
50|$|The Vigilante bolus is an {{insecticide}} {{used with}} both dairy and beef cattle {{to reduce the}} number of flies in an area. It works by releasing an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator) that stops the development of insects before they become flies. Essentially preventing them from reproducing. The bolus, when used with an insecticidal <b>ear</b> <b>tag,</b> devastates the populations of horn, barn and face flies.|$|E

5000|$|Since the 1950s it {{has been}} more common to use <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> to {{identify}} livestock because coloured tags are capable of conveying more information than earmarks. Such <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> were popularised by New Zealand dairy farmers in the earliest successful use of them. Because of the ubiquity of earmarking, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became common parlance to call any identifying mark an earmark. In early times many politicians were country or farming folk and were adept at using such words in different ways and in creating new concepts.|$|R
50|$|On 11 January 2011 a Murray Grey cow {{was swept}} 95 {{kilometres}} by flood waters that raced through a property owned by Veronica Nutley, at Patrick Estate, near Lowood in the Brisbane Valley. The cow was found alive, three days later, in Moreton Bay and was towed through mangroves to shore. She was identified by her National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> {{and returned to}} her owner.|$|E
50|$|From its {{introduction}} on 1 July 1996 the passport {{was a single}} green A4 paper sheet. This showed details of the animal including its birth holding, <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> number, breed, date of birth, sex and its mother's <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> number. Also included {{were a number of}} sections to be filled in when the animal moved to other holdings, showing the movement date and the new holding number (holdings include other farms, agricultural shows and abattoirs). At the time of {{its introduction}} there was no requirement for such movements to be registered centrally. When this requirement was introduced on 28 September 1998, a further A4 document was issued for all existing cattle, to be used in conjunction with the green A4 passport. This was the Certificate of CTS Registration, and it included pre-paid postage tear-off movement cards to be sent to BCMS to register each movement. Movements could be registered using these cards, or electronically by using the new online CTS. Because of the limited lifespan of cattle, few green A4 passports remain in use.|$|E
50|$|Very small {{ear tags}} are {{available}} for laboratory animals such as mice and rats. They are usually sold with a device that pierces the animal's ear and installs the tag at the same time. Lab animals can also be identified by other methods such as ear punching or marking (also used for livestock; see below), implanted RFID tags (mice {{are too small to}} wear an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> containing an RFID chip), and dye.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of number}} (year) branding, tattoos or <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> with numbers or {{different}} colours are good methods of identifying {{the age of}} cattle, if they are used according to standards.|$|R

50|$|Herds {{of cattle}} are often marked using a freeze brand to show which herd or owner they belong to. Other methods {{of doing this}} include <b>ear</b> <b>tags,</b> <b>ear</b> notches, ear tattoos, and {{electronic}} identification. These are often used in conjunction to freeze branding, with one being an individual marker and the other, usually the freeze brand, denoting the herd.|$|R
50|$|The several {{components}} or {{degrees of}} development range from an <b>ear</b> <b>tag,</b> preauricular appendage, preauricular tag, or accessory tragus, to supernumerary ears or polyotia. It {{is a relatively}} common congenital anomaly of the first branchial arch or second branchial arches. Other anomalies may be present concurrently, including cleft palate, cleft lip, or mandibular hypoplasia. There is a known association with Goldenhar syndrome (oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome) and with Wildervanck syndrome. There may also be an association with congenital cartilaginous rest of the neck.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non {{electronic}} ear tags may be simply handwritten {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet).|$|E
50|$|Every {{bovine animal}} in the United Kingdom (as {{elsewhere}} in the European Union) has a unique number, shown both on an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> in each ear and on a paper cattle passport which is held by the current keeper of the animal. The system covers cattle and also other bovine animals such as water buffalo, yak, bison and hybrids. The number and passport remain with the animal throughout its life, and are recorded by the slaughterhouse at its death, allowing traceability of the beef. The BCMS central database is called the Cattle Tracing System, and works alongside the physical passport to record the births, deaths and movements of all cattle.|$|E
50|$|The NLIS RFID {{system was}} {{introduced}} in New South Wales on 1 July 2004 and replaced the previous tail tag system for cattle. The approved devices used are the commonly used <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> or alternatively a rumen bolus.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> on cattle has been extremely successful. The <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the U.S. Government asked {{farmers to}} use EID or Electronic Identification <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> on all their cattle. This request {{was part of}} the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) spurred by the {{discovery}} of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Due to poor performance and concern that other people could access their confidential information, only about 30 percent of cattle producers in the United States tried using EID tags using standards based on the low frequency standards, while the UHF standards are being mandated for use in Brazil, Paraguay, and Korea [...] [...] The United States Department of Agriculture maintains a list of manufacturers approved to sell <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> in the USA.|$|R
