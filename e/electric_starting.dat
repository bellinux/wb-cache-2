25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of <b>electric</b> <b>starting,</b> which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E

2500|$|Turtle racing {{has since}} became popular in Canada. Boissevain, Manitoba, located near Turtle Mountain, began hosting the Canadian Turtle Derby in 1972. The Canadian Turtle Derby was {{initially}} a private race among several local turtle owners. It soon grew in popularity {{and began to}} feature parimutuel betting. Molson donated an <b>electric</b> <b>starting</b> gate to the event, which they claimed was the first <b>electric</b> <b>starting</b> gate {{to be used in}} a turtle race. Although there were just 83 turtles in the 1972 event, the field swelled to 447 turtles by 1983. The race takes place in a [...] circle. Other festivals around Canada host races in which the top turtles qualify to represent their city in the Canadian Turtle Derby. Boissevain is now host to a turtle racing hall of fame and a large statue of a racing turtle. Initially crowning the Canadian Champion Turtle at the event, in 1974 they invited a top American turtle to the event to race the Canadian winner. The American team consisted of Lyle Parish, Howard Mitchell, and [...] "Toby" [...] the turtle. Several thousand people attended the final race in the competition. Although the race was initially close, the Canadian turtle was victorious after the American turtle fell asleep halfway through the race.|$|E
