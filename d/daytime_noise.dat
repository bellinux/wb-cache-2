40|$|Abstract; In {{support of}} the {{operation}} of the east coast High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) systems, a continuous measurement of noise and interference data in the frequency band of 3 - 6 MHz was carried out at Cape Race, Newfoundland between August 1, 1998 and May 10, 2000. A procedure called the "minimum of median " was developed to estimate the noise factors from the measured data. The results of the estimation are presented in this report. This estimation showed that (a) nighttime noise power level could be as much as 24. 1 dB above <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> level; (b) <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> level could be sustained for more than 10 hours during the summer, but only for about 6 hours during the winter. The estimated noise factor was then compared the CCIR noise factor for a quiet site [1]. From this comparison, we found that (a) the <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> power level could be as much as 6. 08 dB lower than the corresponding CCIR noise level, and (b) the nighttime noise level could be as much as 6. 72 dB higher than the corresponding CCIR noise level. The transitions from daytime to nighttime or from nighttime to daytime in the measured and CCIR noise data agreed mostly with each other. One exception was that, in the falls of both 1998 and 1999, the nighttime-to-daytime transition in the measured noise data was about two hours earlier.

5000|$|The robin {{produces}} a fluting, warbling [...] during the breeding season. Both {{the male and}} female sing during the winter, when they hold separate territories, the song then sounding more plaintive than the summer version. The female robin moves a short distance from the summer nesting territory to a nearby area that is more suitable for winter feeding. The male robin keeps the same territory throughout the year. During the breeding season, male robins usually initiate their morning song an hour before civil sunrise, and usually terminate their daily singing around thirty minutes after sunset. Nocturnal singing can also occur, especially in urban areas that are artificially lighted during the night. Under artificial light, nocturnal singing can be used by urban robins to actively shunt <b>daytime</b> anthropogenic <b>noise.</b> A variety of calls is also made at any time of year, including a ticking note indicating anxiety or mild alarm.|$|R

This research found that, although noise presents a problem for exposed residents, to date public measures to abate noise levels have been very limited. Some of the negative noise impacts are due to Tirana’s high density physical development pattern and laissez-faire zoning regulations, which permit noise generating uses in residential neighborhoods.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that artificial night lighting can influence animal orientation, but there is less information about its effects on other behaviors. Previous work suggested that light pollution can affect both seasonal and daily patterns of behavior. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the effects of artificial night lighting and <b>daytime</b> traffic <b>noise</b> on the timing of dawn and dusk singing in 6 common songbirds. We recorded singing behavior in 11 nonurban plots: 2 plots with light, but no noise, 3 with light and noise pollution, 3 with noise, but no light, and 3 undisturbed forests. Our results show that artificial night lighting, but not noise, leads to an earlier start of dawn singing in 5 out of 6 species, ranging on average from 10 min for the song thrush to 20 min for the robin and the great tit. This effect was strongest at higher light intensities. We further show that dusk song is also affected: 3 species continued dusk singing for longer in lighted areas, but the effect was smaller than that observed for dawn song (from about 8 min for the blackbird to 14 min for the great tit). For all species, onset and cessation of singing changed relative to sunrise and sunset with the progress of the season. Rain delayed the onset of singing at dawn and advanced the cessation at dusk.

All measurements were made with the incubator operating in a normally functioning mode with the typical surrounding <b>daytime</b> nursery <b>noise.</b> In the incubators the noise spectra fell within NC- 52 (NCB- 41 /NR- 52 /RC- 45) and NC- 67 (NCB- 59 /NR- 65 /RC- 61) and in the nurseries between NC- 49 (NCB- 45 /NR- 50 /RC- 47) and NC- 68 (NCB- 68 /NR- 71 /RC- 68). The Leq in the incubators were in the range 68 - 78 dB (56 - 68 dBA) when in the nurseries they fell between 68 - 77 dB (53 - 73 dBA). In the incubators the spectral energy was found to be concentrated mainly below 250 Hz. The values measured in the incubators revealed a decrease from those available in the literature for similar situations 30 years ago but not very far from the values found 20 years ago. The presence of high SPL's in most of the incubators and nurseries is attributed to the frequent use of loud sound alarms and to inadequate acoustical treatment of both the incubators and the rooms...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to investigate the levels of noise pollution in some hospitals in Taiwan and to study the effects of noise pollution on the physiological and psychological reactions and annoyance response of medical care staff, patients and visitors in these hospitals. An instrument for the measurement of sound level was used and a self-answered survey questionnaire on noise pollution was administered. Results showed that the daily average sound levels measured inside these hospitals during daytime were between 52. 6 and 64. 6 decibels. These are higher than the current <b>daytime</b> environmental <b>noise</b> limit of 50 decibels in Taiwan. Most nursing staff members expressed that “talking of visitors or patient’s family members ” is the major source of noise inside the wards, whereas “talking of visitors or patient’s family members ” and “children playing ” are the two major noise sources outside the wards. However, most patients or visitors claimed that “doors opening or closing ” and “patients moaning or crying” are the two major sources of noise inside the wards. “Footsteps, ” “renovation of hospitals, ” “talking of visitors or patient’s family members, ” “shouting of nursing staff ” and “doors opening or closing ” are the five major noise sources outside the wards. To conclude, noise pollution inside and outside the wards either directly or indirectly affects, in a simultaneous manner, the subjective perception of noise, emotions, physiology and experience of noise inside and outside the wards of both the medical care staff and the patients and visitors...|$|R

Analysis of the data showed that road traffic noise levels hardly changed globally over this period of 13 years.

To characterize this noise and examine its potential impact on belugas, a 4 -hydrophone array was deployed in the area and continuously recorded for five weeks in May-June 2009. The source levels of the different vessel types showed little dependence on vessel size or speed increase. Their spectral range covered 33 dB. Lowest noise levels occurred at night, when ferry crossing pace was reduced, and <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> peaked during whale-watching tour departures and arrivals. Natural ambient noise prevailed 9. 4 % of the time. Ferry traffic added 30 - 35 dB to ambient levels above 1 kHz during crossings, which contributed 8 to 14 dB to hourly averages.

Assuming no behavioral or auditory compensation, half of the time, beluga potential communication range was reduced to less than 30 % of its expected value under natural noise conditions, and to less than 15 % for one quarter of the time, with little dependence on call frequency. The echolocation band for this population of belugas was also affected by the shipping noise...|$|E

40|$|We present long-overdue {{details about}} the {{intensity}} and spectral characteristics of 150 -km echoes observed by the São Luís radar in Brazil. The São Luís observations show that the echoes usually come from multiple scattering layers that descend in altitude before local noon, and ascend during afternoon hours, similar {{to what has been}} found in observations made in other longitude sectors. The layers are usually 3 – 5 km thick and located, mostly, between 130 and 170 km altitude. The measurements also show variations in echo intensity that are similar to observations made at other equatorial and off-equatorial sites. Analysis of observations made during 2008 shows significant (> 37 %) monthly occurrence rates for every month. Reduced occurrence rates were observed around March Equinox. We associate this reduction in occurrence rate, however, to a non-geophysical factor. An increase in the <b>daytime</b> sky <b>noise</b> in the months around March Equinox causes a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the echoes, which makes them less distinguishable in our analysis. A higher occurrence of weaker echoes around March Equinox was confirmed by an statistical analysis of the seasonal variation of echo intensities. Strong, long-lasting and, therefore, more noticeable echoing layers, however, were observed between June and early September compared to other months in 2008. Spectral analyses show that most of the echoes have negative mean Doppler shifts indicating upward velocities. The echoes also have narrow spectral widths of only a few m s− 1 . Finally, we also found that the mean Doppler shift of the observed echoes can vary noticeably with altitude at times. Using spaced antenna measurements we show that this is caused by the wide field-of-view of the radar and the spatial distribution of the scatterers within the radar beam...|$|R

The past 3 years have seen continued interest in both short term effects of noise on sleep (arousals, awakenings), as well as epidemiological studies focusing on long term health impacts of nocturnal noise exposure. This research corroborated findings that noise events induce arousals at relatively low exposure levels, and independent of the noise source (air, road, and rail traffic, neighbors, church bells) and the environment (home, laboratory, hospital). New epidemiological studies support already existing evidence that night-time noise is likely associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke in the elderly. These studies collectively also suggest that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of cardiovascular disease than <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> exposure. Relative to noise policy, new effect-oriented noise protection concepts, and rating methods based on limiting awakening reactions were introduced. The publications of WHO′s ′′Night Noise Guidelines for Europe′′ and ′′Burden of Disease from Environmental Noise′′ both stress the importance of nocturnal noise exposure for health and well-being. However, studies demonstrating a causal pathway that directly link noise (at ecological levels) and disturbed sleep with cardiovascular disease and/or other long term health outcomes are still missing. These studies, as well as the quantification of the impact of emerging noise sources (e. g., high speed rail, wind turbines) have been identified as the most relevant issues that should be addressed in the field on the effects of noise on sleep in the near future...|$|E

However, {{the nature of the}} information conveyed in reef noise is as yet unknown. In this study, the characteristics of daytime acoustic recordings from patch and fringing reefs in the Las Perlas Archipelago, Pacific Panama were compared. Recordings of ambient noise made during the day showed coral reef communities produced acoustic profiles that varied spatially across the Archipelago. At eleven reef sites in the north of the Archipelago, data were also collected on fish and benthic communities using standard visual survey techniques. These data, along with existing survey data from 40 reef sites, were compared with short-term (2 minute) acoustic profiles to explore associations between point sampled acoustic and census data. Using a correlation matrix, the best predictors of acoustic characteristics were identified from a range of factors, including fish density and biomass, coral and fish diversity, coral and algal cover, reef depth and sea state. Multiple regression GLMs highlighted the importance of fish density and diversity on noise below 1 kHz, and coral and benthic diversity on noise above 1 kHz. A positive correlation was also found between coral cover and <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> intensity across the entire Archipelago, suggesting potential in the future development of passive acoustics as a method for rapid ecological assessment or for long-term monitoring of reefs.

40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} a major {{environmental}} source of pollution both in developed and in developing countries. This study {{was carried out in}} Morogoro municipality, located about 200 km west of Dar es Salaam the business capital of Tanzania. Total of 16 measuring points were selected along main roads and A-weighted continuous equivalent sound level meters was used for measurement of noise level. The average noise equivalent level at measured points varied between 51. 1 to 75. 1 dBA. The results established the fact that noise levels are more than the acceptable limit of 55 dBA, which is the <b>daytime</b> governmentally prescribed <b>noise</b> limit for residential-commercial areas. This study also describes the reaction of the Morogoro residents to environmental noise pollution. A total of 200 questionnaires were processed. The results of the interview questionnaire revealed that the main isolated noise source was traffic (51 %) and street noise (29 %). About 45 % of the respondents classified the noise in their street as “high”; and that noise bother 77 % of the respondent more in daytime. The main impacts of exposure to noise were reported to be headache, hearing problem, sleeplessness, difficulty to concentrate and conversation disruption. This study recommends raising community awareness on noise pollution, structural management, traffic management and enforcement of laws and regulations so as to control noise pollution...|$|R
40|$|Field {{intensity}} of {{atmospheric radio noise}} on 2. 5 Mc/s was measured on board the "SOYA" along the course from Tokyo to Antarctica. Results of {{the analysis of the}} measurements are summarized as follows: 1) The <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> intensity which is predominant in the tropical region and near South Africa corresponds well to the meteorological situation. 2) Atmospheric radio noise intensity measured on board the "SOYA" agrees well with the values predicted on the "Noise Map" prepared by CRPL and with the result of measurement at the fixed stations (Singapore and Pretoria). 3) Characteristics of the atmospheric radio noise were examined in connection with the solar zenith angle and the latitude. Both the mode of diurnal variation and the relation between absorption and solar zenith angle very distinctly with the latitude. 4) Decrease in the intensity at midnight towards the south from about 32 °S is greater than that of the intensity calculated only from the distance (the so-called unabsorbed field intensity) and smaller than what was predicted on the CRPL 2 ̆ 7 s map. 5) Abnormal enhancement of the radio noise was seen when the ship went under the pouring rain, while the noise fell down to zero level with a flash of lightning, and then it rose exponentially with the time constant of the order of 1 minute. These facts seem to suggest the mechanism how the atmospheric radio noise originates in rain falls. In other words, the precipitation noise due to rainfall occurs in the presence of both raindrops and the static field between the earth and the cell of charged clouds...|$|E
40|$|The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) {{recorded}} continuous seismic data {{over the}} Midcontinent Rift from April 2011 through October 2013. Analysis of {{power spectral density}} (PSD) estimates shows that horizontal noise levels at periods > 20 s vary seasonally and diurnally. During winter, horizontal noise power at many SPREE stations is within 5 dB of nearby Transportable Array (TA) stations. As the ground thaws, SPREE stations in fine-grained material such as silt or clay become noisier due {{to changes in the}} mechanical properties of the soil. During summer, the daily mean PSD value of stations in fine-grained material is approximately 10 – 20 dB higher than in the winter, and <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> levels are 20 – 30 dB higher than nights. Stations in sandy material also show diurnal variations of 20 – 30 dB during summer, but the daily mean PSD value varies no more than 5 – 10 dB during the year. Most neighboring TA stations have relatively constant daily mean PSDs, and their horizontal components show summer diurnal variations of 10 – 15 dB. Some very quiet TA stations, such as SPMN, show a 5 – 10 dB increase in horizontal noise power during winter. The timing and amplitude of horizontal noise power variations between 20 and 800 s correlate with variations in atmospheric pressure PSDs. We propose that the grain size and pore water content of the material surrounding a shallow seismic station influences the local response to atmospheric pressure. Stations that must be placed in soft sediments should be installed in sandy, well-drained material to minimize long-period noise generated by atmospheric pressure variations...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{natural gas}} {{production}} increased 40 % from 2000 to 2015. This growth is largely related to technological advances in horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Environmental exposures upon impacted communities {{are a significant}} public health concern. Noise associated with natural gas compressor stations {{has been identified as}} a major concern for nearby residents, though limited studies exist. We conducted a pilot study to characterize noise levels in 11 homes located in Doddridge County, West Virginia, and determined whether these levels differed based on time of day, indoors vs. outdoors, and proximity of homes to natural gas compressor stations. We also compared noise levels at increasing distances from compressor stations to available noise guidelines, and evaluated low frequency noise presence. We collected indoor and outdoor 24 -hour measurements (Leq, 24 hr) in eight homes located within 750 meters (m) of the nearest compressor station and three control homes located > 1000 m. We then evaluated how A-weighted decibel (dBA) exposure levels differed based on factors outlined above. The geometric mean (GM) for 24 -hour outdoor noise levels at homes located < 300 m (Leq, 24 hr: 60. 3 dBA; geometric standard deviation (GSD) : 1. 0) from the nearest compressor station was nearly 9 dBA higher than control homes (Leq, 24 hr: 51. 6 dBA; GSD: 1. 1). GM for 24 hour indoor noise for homes < 300 m (Leq, 24 hr: 53. 4 dBA; GSD: 1. 2) from the nearest compressor station was 11. 2 dBA higher than control homes (Leq, 24 hr: 42. 2 dBA; GSD: 1. 1). Indoor average <b>daytime</b> <b>noise</b> for homes < 300 m of the nearest compressor stations were 13. 1 dBA higher than control homes, while indoor nighttime readings were 9. 4 dBA higher. Findings indicate that living near a natural gas compressor station could potentially result in high environmental noise exposures. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate potential health impacts and protection measures...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lifelines is a {{prospective}} population-based cohort study investigating the biological, behavioral and environmental determinants of healthy ageing among 167, 729 participants from the North East {{region of the}} Netherlands. The collection and geocoding of (history of) home and work addresses allows linkage of individual-level health data to detailed exposure data. We describe the reasons for choosing particular assessments of environmental exposures in LifeLines and consider the implications for future investigations. METHODS: Exposure to ambient air pollution and road traffic noise was estimated using harmonized models. Data on noise annoyance, perceived exposure to electromagnetic fields, perceived living environment, and neighborhood characteristics were collected with questionnaires. A comprehensive medical assessment and questionnaires were completed {{in order to assess}} determinants of health and well-being. Blood and urine samples were collected from all participants and genome wide association data are available for a subsample of 15, 638 participants. RESULTS: Mean age was 45  years (standard deviation (SD) 13  years), and 59  % were female. Median levels of NO 2 and PM 10 were 15. 7 (interquartile range (IQR) 4. 9) μg/m(3) and 24. 0 (IQR 0. 6) μg/m(3) respectively. Median levels of <b>daytime</b> road traffic <b>noise</b> were 54. 0 (IQR 4. 2) dB(A). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of harmonized environmental exposures and extensive assessment of health outcomes in LifeLines offers great opportunities for environmental epidemiology.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model for assessing TRAffic Noise EXposure (TRANEX) in an open-source geographic information system. Instead of using proprietary software we developed our own model for two main reasons: 1) so that the treatment of source geometry, traffic information (flows/speeds/spatially varying diurnal traffic profiles) and receptors matched as closely as possible to that of the air pollution modelling being undertaken in the TRAFFIC project, and 2) to optimize model performance for practical reasons of needing to implement a noise model with detailed source geometry, over a large geographical area, to produce noise estimates at up to several million address locations, with limited computing resources. To evaluate TRANEX, noise estimates were compared with noise measurements made in the British cities of Leicester and Norwich. High correlation was seen between modelled and measured LAeq, 1 hr (Norwich: r =  0. 85, p = . 000; Leicester: r =  0. 95, p = . 000) with average model errors of 3. 1  dB. TRANEX was used to estimate noise exposures (LAeq, 1 hr, LAeq, 16 hr, Lnight) for the resident population of London (2003 – 2010). Results suggest that 1. 03 million (12 %) people are exposed to <b>daytime</b> road traffic <b>noise</b> levels ≥  65  dB(A) and 1. 63 million (19 %) people are exposed to night-time road traffic noise levels ≥  55  dB(A). Differences in noise levels between 2010 and 2003 were on average relatively small: 0. 25  dB (standard deviation: 0. 89) and 0. 26  dB (standard deviation: 0. 87) for LAeq, 16 hr and Lnight...|$|R
