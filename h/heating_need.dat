40|$|Using {{energy at}} low-quality levels opens up new {{possibilities}} for low-energy houses. Low-quality energy can be heat at a temperature that {{is close to}} that of its surrounding, and can be used, for example, to pre-heat ventilation air or domestic hot water. Pre-heating the incoming outdoor air reduces the need to heat ventilation and reduces the need for high-quality energy such as electricity or heat from a fire. This thesis investigates two such possible energy utilizations, the PV/T solar window and the hybrid ventilation system. They are very different in how they {{reduce the need for}} auxiliary energy in buildings, and they cover different fields of low-energy building technique. However, what they have in common is the concept of low-quality energy. The solar window produces both electricity and hot water. What the photovoltaic cells cannot utilize at the high-quality energy level is instead used to produce hot water. The hybrid ventilation system pre-heats the incoming ventilation air in the heat recovery system, thereby lowering the need for high-quality energy. The PV/T solar window comprises PV cells laminated on solar absorbers placed in a window behind the glazing. To reduce the costs of solar electricity, tiltable refl ectors were included in the design to concentrate solar radiation onto the solar cells. The refl ectors enable control of the amount of solar radiation transmitted into the building. The insulated refl ectors also reduce thermal losses through the window. The effects on the light distribution and the architectural implications are discussed in earlier studies (Fieber, 2005; Fieber et al., 2003; Fieber, Nilsson, & Karlsson, 2004) together with effects on the building when different strategies for controlling the reflectors are used. Long-term measurements were taken of the thermal- and electrical energy output from the solar window. A model was developed to simulate the electricity and hot water production, and the model was calibrated against the measured values from a prototype solar window installed in a laboratory and against a solar window built into a single-family building. The results from the simulation showed that the solar window produces about 35 % more electrical energy per unit cell area than a vertical flat PV module. However, PV cells placed {{on the roof of the}} building would produce approximately 17 % more electricity per unit cell area than the solar window. The simulations carried out on system level showed that installing a 16 m² solar window (glazed area) in a single-family building reduces the annual <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> by approximately 600 kWh. However, if the absorbers (5. 06 m²) and PV cells (4 m²) from the solar window are installed separately on the roof instead of in the window, the annual <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> is reduced by a further 1100 kWh. A water-to-air heat exchanger was developed for use in naturally ventilated buildings. This requires that the pressure drop of the air is kept close to zero. The heat exchanger comprises solar collector absorbers soldered onto a manifold. Basic heat transfer equations were used in order to optimize the dimensions of the heat exchanger in terms of heat transfer and pressure drop. A laboratory measurement showed the temperature heat recovery rate to be 80 % at component level. At the same time the pressure drop was 1 Pa for the designed air flow rate. System simulations were then carried out in order to investigate the impact for a building equipped with natural/hybrid ventilation with heat recovery. A brine-based heat recovery system enables the utilization of other energy sources such as ground collectors or waste water heat recovery units. A waste water heat recovery system was built into a single-family house, and was designed to supply energy to both domestic hot water and the ventilation system. The simulations showed that a typical single-family house can reduce the <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> by approximately 600 - 800 kWh annually, i. e. roughly 25 % of the annual need for hot water, with waste water heat recovery. The simulations showed that using ground collectors for the ventilation system has limited effects on the <b>heating</b> <b>need,</b> so the main benefit is limited to lowering the risk of frost on the heat exchanger surface. The overall conclusion from an energy perspective is that the solar window performs poorly compared to standard solar energy components. The hybrid ventilation system with the developed heat exchangers has the potential to be an interesting ventilation system when building low-energy houses or when renovating residential buildings to improve energy effi ciency...|$|E
40|$|The European Union {{appointed}} in 2007 an objective {{to reduce the}} energy consumption with 20 % and increase the utilization of renewable energy resources with 20 % within year 2020. This master thesis analysed a passive house kindergarten in Trondheim built in 2013 with a heat supply system based on renewable heat sources, solar collectors combined with a ground source heat pump. The possibility of storing solar heat seasonally in energy wells was also taken into consideration. The kindergarten was modelled in the simulation program IDA ICE, in order to perform simulations and analyse the building s heat supply system. The model was initiated through the author s preliminary project thesis. As {{the aim was to}} make the model as realistic as possible, all documentation used as basis for the input data was received from Rambøll, who did the projecting of the heat supply system. Issues particularly of interest were the resulting net annual energy need of the building, heating loads and the performance of the heat plant. Indoor environment in the occupied zones and ventilation control strategies were also examined. Parameters regarding system design and operation were changed in order to study how this affected the results. At last, an economic evaluation of the heat supply system was carried out too see whether the heat supply system was economically preferable. The net annual energy need according to IDA ICE was 57, 4 kWh/m 2, in which the <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> was 33, 1 kWh/m 2. Judging by IDA ICE results, the installed radiators at Haukåsen kindergarten have oversized capacity, while the heating coil and domestic hot water load was dimensioned with too low heating load. Out of the net annual <b>heating</b> <b>need,</b> the results showed that the heat pump covered 81, 5 %, the boiler 12, 5 % and the solar collector 6 %. As the heat pump coverage was found to be only 24 % of the heating load, the high coverage of the net annual <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> indicated an oversized capacity in the heat pump. This may cause earlier wear out of the compressor due to part-load operation most of the time. The results related to analysis of the solar collector showed that the solar collector contribution was 1 608 kWh/year, but the theoretical efficiency implied that a contribution of 4 241 kWh/year could be expected. Either doubling of the collector area or optimization of the tilting angle gave noticeably higher contribution. Neither did changing of the shape factor for the hot water tank. Thus the default control strategy of the solar collector circuit in IDA ICE was questioned, and ought to be further studied. As the zones in the kindergarten have demand controlled ventilation based on temperature, presence and CO 2 concentration, different ventilation control macros were developed and implemented in the IDA ICE model. This resulted in more energy efficient ventilation and 1 388 kWh was saved each year due to decreased energy need for fan operation. Realization of night set-back contributed to decrease the net annual <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> with 5 969 kWh/year. Nevertheless, the low annual energy need was at the sacrifice of the indoor environment. The night set-back implied too low zone air temperatures during wintertime, while the occupancy controlled ventilation led to excess temperature during summertime. Simulation of underground thermal energy storage was carried out by changing the IDA ICE plant macro. A ground heat exchanger ensured transfer of heat from the solar collector circuit to the brine return pipeline. The result showed a 78 % increase in annual solar heat contribution and 0, 08 °C increase in ground temperature over a year. This indicated that the heat pump COP would remain high for a longer time period than in the model without the ground heat exchanger. To confirm this, further studies on the subject should involve simulations over longer time periods. The economic analysis showed that the existing heat plant in the kindergarten has a global cost of 452 892 NOK and a pay-off period of 25 years. If the solar collector had not been installed, 25 667 NOK could have been saved in global cost and 1, 3 years in pay-off period. Nevertheless, installation of solar collectors was a deciding factor when the building received the label Very good according to the building classification system BREEAM. On this basis the solar collector was considered a valuable investment. Sensitivity analysis showed that an increase in real interest rate gave lower global costs and a higher pay-off period...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation has}} been made to design an isotope heat source capable of satisfying the conflicting thermal requirements of steady-state operation and atmosphere entry. The isotope heat source must transfer heat efficiently to a heat exchange during normal operation with a power system in space, and {{in the event of a}} mission abort, it must survive the thermal environment of atmosphere entry and ground impact without releasing radioactive material. A successful design requires a compatible integration of the internal components of the heat source with the external aerodynamic shape. To this end, configurational, aerodynamic, motion, and thermal analyses were coupled and iterated during atmosphere entries at suborbital through superorbital velocities at very shallow and very steep entry angles. Results indicate that both thermal requirements can be satisfied by a heat source which has a single stable aerodynamic orientation at hypersonic speeds.

40|$|AbstractBy {{process of}} time, and {{increasing}} demand for fossil,a tendency towards renewable energy started for different uses, {{the most important}} of which is: power generation, and water heating,by using solar power. Since, mostly, the average temperature for heating water given by solar power is [50 CD],and radiators <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> water of [70 - 90 C°], temperature, as such floor heating is suitable in thermal applications. Radiant-floor heat is commonly designed for residential applications, where ventilation requirements are often met by operable windows, and cooling is not mandatory. Other applications include large open buildings, such as airplane hangars, where providing heat at the floor is much more cost-effective than heating the entire volume of air in the space. Water in the radiant-floor loop is often around [45 C¡], depending on the floor finish. This is a lower temperature than forced hot-air systems, and reduces the energy required to heat the building. Buildings that have high ceilings, large windows, or high infiltration rates or that require high air change rates can save additional energy by using radiant floor heat. This research deals with the problems arising from the floor heating solar systems execution in concern with (large size of the storage tank and high cost of Constituent etc) The studied room exists in renewable energy lab in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Faculty-Damascus University.

40|$|The {{climate in}} cities differs {{significantly}} from {{those found in}} the surrounding area. These differences results from modifications of the Earth's surface that alters the disposition of “natural energy balance” at a micro-scale and the concentration of activities that results in anthropogenic emissions that change the composition of the atmosphere. These urban effects have distinctive temporal and spatial properties with different impacts on building energy performance depending on their purpose which are rarely accounted for. This paper examines performance implications of a change-of-use (from office to residential) {{in the context of the}} UK government's proposal to encourage regeneration and to meet housing needs. However, the diurnal occupation and activity patterns of these uses are distinct. For office buildings, with daytime occupation, focus is on the diurnal heating cycle driven by solar energy gains to which internal energy sources must be added.

During {{a large part of}} the year internal heat gains from people, household electricity and solar heat gains balance the heat losses with zero <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> as a result. All energy uses in a building are part of the buildings energy balance and for example the heat gains from a higher use of household electricity should result in a lower use of heating given that the heating control systems work as intended. Different user characteristics will result in different heating demand in the same building, and in low energy buildings different user characteristics will have a relatively higher impact compared to a less energy efficient buildings. Household electricity and domestic hot water was measured during one year in 520 one bedroom apartments and 462 two bedroom apartments in Sweden. The average annual use of household electricity was 27. 7 kWh/m² in one bedroom apartments and 29. 1 kWh/m² in two bedroom apartments. The use varied between almost zero and 90 kWh/m 2 in the different apartments. Average annual domestic hot water heating was 20. 1 kWh/m² in one bedroom apartments and 22. 8 kWh/m² in two bedroom apartments. The use varied between zero and 140 kWh/m². The correlation between household electricity and domestic hot water was studied and different user scenarios were defined. The user scenarios were used as input data for simulations of heating demand in order to study different users' impact on the heating demand in buildings with different characteristics. The result shows that the users can have a strong impact on a buildings heating demand and in order to determine the impact that different users will have, it must be analyzed based on the actual building since it is determined not only by the user related energies but also by the building's characteristics...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the European Directive 2010 / 31 /EU (formerly 2002 / 91 /EC) is to reduce the energy {{consumption}} of buildings introducing an energy labeling protocol which is expected to capture the attention and reorient the market, sustaining the diffusion of more efficient solutions. In order to evaluate the building energy performance, either analytical approaches or enhanced simulation tools are allowed. The coherence of the methods is important in order to avoid misleading results which can affect the evaluation by the market and eventually compromise the Directive effectiveness. The European Standard EN ISO 13790 : 2008 suggests to use the dynamic simulation in improving and tuning the quasi-steady state method proposed, and in particular to refine the correlation used to calculate the utilization factors (i. e., the dynamic parameters which reduce the thermal gains for <b>heating</b> <b>need</b> calculation and the thermal losses for cooling). Many efforts in calibrating the EN ISO 13790 : 2008 led to some changes on the correlations proposed in order to adapt the method to the climatic conditions, especially for the cooling season, and the building stock’s characteristics in different countries, but large discrepancies have been found. Differently from the previous works, the authors analyze the discrepancy sources focusing firstly on thermal losses, instead of considering directly the final result in term of energy needs. In this paper, the deviations between the thermal losses are evaluated, by means of an extensive use of simulation, analyzing a set of a 960 configurations obtained by the factorial combination of different values for the building shape, envelope insulation and composition, window type and size, ventilation rate and climatic conditions.

The work described in this dissertation represents efforts not only to explore new tools to evaluate current monitoring techniques but also to develop new FUS monitoring modalities. In the first study, a new evaluation platform for ultrasound thermometry using infrared (IR) thermography was developed and demonstrated using phantoms subjected to FUS heating, providing a fast calibration and validation tool with spatiotemporal temperature information unavailable with traditional thermocouple measurements. In the second study, IR thermography was investigated as a new tool for high temperature FUS ablation monitoring. The spatiotemporal temperature characteristics in correspondence to lesion formation and bubble activities were identified using simultaneous IR and bright-field imaging. Tissue-specific thermal damage threshold, which is critical for accurate estimation of tissue status based on temperature time history, was also obtained using the same system. In the final study, we developed a novel dual-wavelength photoacoustic (PA) sensing technique for monitoring tissue status during thermal treatments, which is capable of separating the two effects from temperature rise and changes in optical properties due to tissue alteration.
