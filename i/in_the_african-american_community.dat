5|$|Harold Washington, {{the subject}} of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the Illinois House of Representatives. After the death of Richard J. Daley in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, {{prevailing}} over Bernard Epton in a racially polarizing general election. His first four-year term was characterized by the Council Wars, a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in City Council. Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} his office. His death was followed by a period of mourning by Chicagoans, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> and inner cities. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous {{feminism}} is an intersectional {{theory and practice}} of feminism that focuses on decolonization and indigenous sovereignty. The focus is upon empowering indigenous women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of indigenous cultural values and priorities, rather than mainstream, white, patriarchal ones. In this cultural perspective, it can be compared to womanism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|R
2500|$|That Third Period line {{also called}} for {{creation}} of new, revolutionary unions outside the AFL. While Foster had always denounced dual unionism, he dutifully complied with the Comintern's directive, renaming the Trade Union Education League as the Trade Union Unity League. Foster and the Party also followed the line by denouncing social democrats as [...] "social fascists" [...] and attacking former allies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>communities</b> as bourgeois collaborators.|$|R

25|$|In {{people with}} {{naturally}} curly or straight hair, the hairstyle is instead typically created {{with the help}} of creams, gels or other solidifying liquids to hold the hair in place. Particularly popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> of the late 1960s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, in {{collaboration}} with Dr. Ian K. Smith and State Farm Insurance, began a partnership, encouraging members to become healthier by exercising and eating properly. Members joined with others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> to reverse the deadly effects of obesity. At the 2008 National Convention in Orlando, Florida, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority was presented with an award for the most weight lost by any sorority or fraternity.|$|E

25|$|The {{rates of}} {{breastfeeding}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> remain {{much lower than}} any other race, {{for a variety of}} reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, as well as systemic racism in the American healthcare system that does not offer adequate support to African-American breastfeeding mothers. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class.|$|E
25|$|This {{apparent}} {{weakness is}} balanced by mutual-aid systems established by extended {{family members to}} provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion and manners to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community,</b> providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the South Carolina campaign, most pundits had {{predicted}} Barack Obama the winner, {{primarily because of}} the state's large African-American population. For this reason, Obama was shown to be significantly ahead of his two rivals, John Edwards, who carried the state in 2004, and Hillary Clinton, whose husband was popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community.</b> In early polls taken in {{the weeks leading up to}} the primary, Clinton had a double-digit lead over both Edwards and Obama (see poll averages above).|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, as {{the result}} of the blackface {{minstrel}} show, African-American music entered mainstream American society. By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, ragtime, jazz, blues, and swing also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the Jazz Age. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American Broadway shows, films such as King Vidor's Hallelujah!, and operas such as George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} after slavery and {{particularly}} during the depression era, Islam reemerged {{in the form of}} highly visible and sometimes controversial movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community.</b> The first of these of note was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Noble Drew Ali. Ali had a profound influence on Wallace Fard, who later founded the Black nationalist Nation of Islam in 1930. Elijah Muhammad became head of the organization in 1934. Much like Malcolm X, who left the Nation of Islam in 1964, many African-American Muslims now follow traditional Islam.|$|E
25|$|Paul Gilroy and Alexander Weheliye {{state that}} unlike disco, jazz, R, house music, and other genres that were {{developed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> {{and which were}} quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives, hip hop has remained largely controlled by African American artists, producers and executives. In his book, Phonographies, Weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables. In contrast, Greg Tate states that the market-driven, commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of African-American culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms. Tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for African-American communities.|$|E

500|$|When it was {{introduced}} to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats, but generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>communities</b> of <b>the</b> South. It endured the fall of slavery and gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace, it gained further favor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for [...] "Sunday dinner". Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> slave <b>community,</b> slaves quickly {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} funeral procedures {{and the location}} of gravesites of family and friends. Specific slaves were assigned to prepare dead bodies, build coffins, dig graves, and construct headstones. Slave funerals were typically at night when the workday was over, with the master present to view all the ceremonial procedures. Slaves from nearby plantations were regularly in attendance.|$|R
500|$|Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an {{international}} activist movement, originating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community,</b> that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people.

500|$|BeyoncÃ©'s lighter {{skin color}} and costuming has drawn {{criticism}} from some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community.</b> Emmett Price, {{a professor of}} music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race {{plays a role in}} many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. In 2008, L'OrÃ©al was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that [...] "it is categorically untrue", and in 2013, BeyoncÃ© herself criticized H for their proposed [...] "retouching" [...] of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only [...] "natural pictures be used".|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{fried chicken}} was cooked in fat (though un{{seasoned}}) while West African fried chicken was seasoned (but battered and cooked in palm oil). [...] Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques {{were used in}} the American South by African slaves. [...] Fried chicken provided some means of independent economy for enslaved and segregated African-American women, who became noted sellers of poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of this and the expensive nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular belief, a rare dish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> reserved (as in Africa) for special occasions.|$|E

The subsequent 1988 Castro Street Fair was named [...] "A Tribute to Sylvester," [...] and although he was too ill to attend, crowds chanted his name {{to such an extent that}} he was able to hear them from his bedroom. He continued to give interviews to the media, being open about the fact that he was dying of AIDS, and sought in particular to highlight the impact that the disease was having <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community.</b> In an interview with the NME, he stated, [...] "I don't believe that AIDS is the wrath of God.

500|$|She {{appeared}} as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance {{was awarded the}} National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress; in an interesting coincidence {{she became the first}} woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career, she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio). The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>African-American</b> <b>community</b> were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, {{and it would be a}} really special script that would require something like that again." ...|$|E
