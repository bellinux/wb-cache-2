40|$|Choice of {{poor people}} towards the type of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> (public or private) has not been much discussed. This is {{mainly because of the}} {{underlying}} assumption that their choice has always been restricted to public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> The ineffi ciency of the public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system in India has created a vacuum among the poor people regarding their preference for <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Their tendency to transform from accessing public to private <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> is discussed in this context.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} examines the cross price elasticities between different <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> For example, increasing the patient out of pocket price for some <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> increases the utilization of other <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> Yet, the literature has generally ignored the connection between cost sharing for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> and labor market outcomes. This paper examines the direction and magnitude of the reduced form relationship between patient cost-sharing and work loss following methods used to study the impact of cost-sharing and medical spending, finding a positive, quantitatively meaningful association between cost-sharing and hours absent. We find no such association between cost-sharing and the probability of incurring short-term disability days. This suggests that the cross-market ramifications of higher patient cost sharing extend beyond other <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> to include broad labor market outcomes...|$|R
