25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost {{in response to the}} narrower market.|$|E

However, certain regional provinces might not <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of luxury, and tends to be conservative. Next to national laws, several Indonesian provinces has applied regional autonomous law, which some of them based on Islamic sharia law, such as Aceh province, {{and the city of}} Palembang. Extra caution must be demonstrated by visitors to Aceh, since the province has a rather strict Islamic-based law, enforced by Islamic religious police, called Wilayatul Hisbah. Thus, some certain normally private matters, such as beach clothing (esp, bikini), modesty issue, party and the consumption of alcohol, to a display of affections between couple, are discouraged and frowned upon, and might led to a legal problem. Carefulness and discretion is highly required, especially for unmarried couple and LGBT travellers.|$|E

500|$|A review {{published}} March 8, 2010 in the Air Force Times cited overall negative {{reviews from}} bomb experts in Iraq {{attached to the}} 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film's portrayal of a bomb expert [...] "grossly exaggerated and not appropriate," [...] and describing the lead character as [...] "more of a run and gun cowboy type … {{exactly the kind of}} person that we're not looking for." [...] Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's [...] "swagger would put a whole team at risk.

500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same clothes. I suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E
500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E

500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Hannigan used her own experiences in high school—which she called [...] "overwhelmingly depressing"—to guide her portrayal of Willow: [...] "My theory on high school was, get in, get out and hopefully I won't get hurt. Basically it was a miserable experience, because you're a walking hormone in this place that is just so cruel. There were times that were OK, but it's not the little myth that high school is the best years of your life. No way." [...] Whedon intended Willow to be realistically introverted, saying, [...] "I wanted Willow to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have.

I always thought that was an interesting dynamic in his songwriting, and I can only aspire to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of dynamic in my songs". Brandon Flowers of the American rock band The Killers has revealed his admiration for Morrissey on several occasions and admits that his interest for writing songs about murder such as [...] "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" [...] and [...] "Midnight Show" [...] traces back to Morrissey singing about loving [...] "the romance of crime" [...] in the song [...] "Sister I'm a Poet".

2500|$|A legend is that Lincoln {{is shown}} using sign {{language}} to represent his initials, {{with his left}} hand shaped to form an [...] "A" [...] and his right hand to form an [...] "L". The National Park Service denies both stories, calling them urban legends. However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while {{it is not clear that}} sculptor Daniel Chester French intended for Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, i.e., to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees. The National Geographic Society's publication, On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C., states that French had a son who was deaf, and the sculptor was familiar with sign language. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French carved Lincoln's hands to represent the letters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "L" [...] in American Sign Language, [...] "I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of summation about the hands." ...|$|E
