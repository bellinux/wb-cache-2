50|$|In mid-1963, Ford offered {{transistorized}} ignition {{on their new}} 427 FE V8. This system only passed a very low current through the ignition points, using a PNP transistor to perform high-voltage switching of the ignition current, allowing for a higher voltage ignition spark, as well as reducing variations in ignition timing due to arc-wear of the breaker points. Engines so equipped carried special stickers on their valve covers reading “427-T.” AC Delco’s Delcotron Transistor Control Magnetic Pulse Ignition System became optional {{on a number of}} General Motors vehicles beginning in 1964. The Delco system eliminated the mechanical points completely, using magnetic flux variation for current switching, virtually eliminating point wear concerns. In 1967, Ferrari and Fiat Dinos came equipped with Magneti Marelli Dinoplex <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition,</b> and all Porsche 911s had <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> beginning with the B-Series 1969 models.

25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the <b>ignition</b> timing. With <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|R
50|$|Historically, underbones {{led the way}} in {{semi-automatic}} transmissions and indicator systems.
