In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated that doctors expected that it would take about a year before he would recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to <b>how</b> <b>complete</b> of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar.

[...] In {{an effort to}} assure a smooth transition from his rule to that of his son's rule, the prince assembled his vassals and bishops at the Assembly of Strata Florida in Ceredigion. The choice of Strata Florida as the venue for the ceremony was significant as a gauge of <b>how</b> <b>complete</b> the Aberffraw victory was in their claim as the primary princes of Wales and heirs of Rhodri the Great. The Cistercian abby, founded in 1164, was under the patronage of the Dinefwr family, dynastically junior rivals (but also, at times, allies of necessity) of the Aberffraw family. In a ceremony rich in feudal pagentry and with an act of homage reminiscent of Capetian France, the leading magnates of Wales swore fealty and allegiance to Dafydd as their future feudal overlord, suzerain, and prince.|$|E

60|$|A {{room like}} this, thought Mr. Brumley among much other mental driftage, {{is like a}} heart,--so long as it exists it must be {{furnished}} and tenanted. No matter what has been, however bright and sweet and tender, the spaces still cry aloud to be filled again.

His arguments, if arguments they can be called, consist chiefly of metaphors quoted from the Fathers.

They were to him his 'slight Muse,' as he calls them, and intended, as Meres tells us, for private circulation only among a few, a very few, friends.
