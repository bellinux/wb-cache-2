2500|$|The tumultuous {{relationship}} between Wilder and Chandler only enhanced {{the product of}} their collaboration. Wilder, in fact, believed that discord, a tug-of-war, was a vital ingredient necessary for a fruitful collaboration: [...] "If two people think alike," [...] he once said, [...] "it's like two men pulling {{at one end of}} a rope. If you are going to collaborate, you need an opponent to bounce things off of." [...] His tugging with Chandler did have a softer side, it seems: over 60 years after the film's initial release, it was discovered that Chandler had agreed to appear in a fleeting cameo at 16 minutes 12 seconds into the film, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> from a book as Neff walks past in the hallway. This is notable because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.|$|E
60|$|Ursula crimsoned. Her {{girls were}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at her, smirking their accusation.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake was annoyed. He said nothing, and Beatrice, <b>glancing</b> <b>up,</b> {{laughed at}} his gloomy expression.|$|E
60|$|So {{the note}} ran. Frona <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> expectantly at the Indian woman.|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at my entrance.|$|R
60|$|Philippa <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{from her}} work with a little exclamation of surprise.|$|R
60|$|As {{he entered}} the manager's office Mr. Guilfogle made much of <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> with busy amazement.|$|E
60|$|The curate flushed a little, and <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> {{encountered}} the suspicious {{eyes of his}} superior fixed on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom?" [...] said Mrs. Bunting, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at {{eyes that}} were {{suddenly}} eager, and then following their glance towards Chatteris.|$|E
60|$|Philippa <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> to {{find her}} companion's dark eyes fixed upon her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{at him and}} waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|R
60|$|Dane nodded, and {{the girl}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and down the lane suspiciously.|$|R
60|$|His head drooped for a moment, and, <b>glancing</b> <b>up,</b> I saw Hirsch's dark {{inquisitive}} face {{watching us}} through the glass.|$|E
6000|$|The judge {{maintained}} {{silence for}} a moment, turned to whisper to his assistants, and presently, without <b>glancing</b> <b>up,</b> said to the woman: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a great charge," [...] {{said the}} Commander, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at the {{wonderful}} tracery of steel outlined against {{the deep blue}} sky.|$|E
60|$|Elma <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at {{him with}} a certain tinge of half-incredulous surprise.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> hastily, and she {{answered}} the question in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Lady Cicely, after {{a single}} <b>glance</b> <b>up,</b> {{continues}} stitching, apparently quite unconcerned.|$|R
6000|$|... "John Hancock Harris" [...] {{read the}} card, and <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> from it, with sudden {{interest}} in her eyes, the girl exclaimed impulsively,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The dog now stopped barking, {{and stood}} looking at Pomona, {{occasionally}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at us. Pomona took not the slightest notice of him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dix whistled softly and, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at the tall, white-faced {{young man}} before him, pushed his cap back and {{scratched}} his head.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Raggett started, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at {{somebody}} leaning from the window.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> in surprise, and asked who was there.|$|R
60|$|The boy <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and {{saw them}} {{standing}} there. He excused himself gracefully.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, sir," [...] {{returned}} Mr. George, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at {{the great}} letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Burke," [...] said Captain Horn, quickly, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at the noon-day sun, [...] "put her {{out there}} near the wreckage, and take an observation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said I, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at my companion, [...] "that {{was surely}} the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{thoughtful}} a moment; then <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{with a bright}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Philip <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> with a {{quick look}} of {{expectant}} curiosity, but said nothing.|$|R
60|$|She merely <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at his entrance. Her {{eyes were}} still far away.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite unfathomable," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at {{the windows}} of the house, a modern {{structure}} in the new part of the town.|$|E
6000|$|... "A journalist," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at him. [...] "Yes! I {{might have}} guessed that. Are you {{a friend of}} Sir Julien Portel?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{all went}} over to the window, and looked out. It was then that Kate, <b>glancing</b> <b>up,</b> saw the three cruel faces {{surveying}} her.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn Carvel.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> to Jacob Welse, {{as though}} for consent, and {{received}} it.|$|R
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>up.</b> He was strolling leisurely {{along the}} poop {{on the port}} side.|$|R
