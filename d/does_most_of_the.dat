5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E

These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to}} be camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents {{for about a week}} after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
25|$|Incubation lasts between 22 and 26 days, {{and begins}} after laying the first egg, {{although}} it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid. This means the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often {{at least one parent}} remains with them, until they fledge, to guard them. Both parents feed the chicks, although early on in the rearing period, the male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding.|$|E

25|$|Mated pairs produce one {{to three}} eggs per year, laid two to five days apart in March or April and {{incubated}} for 38 days by both parents. Once hatched, chicks are quite tolerant of one another, although the first hatched is often larger and dominates at feeding times. The female <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brooding and direct feeding, with the male taking over now and then. Young are able to feed themselves from five to six weeks and they fledge at eleven to twelve weeks, remaining {{in the vicinity of}} the nest, dependent on their parents for a further six to ten weeks. The sex of nestlings can be identified using field methods, or using DNA.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stage of the colony founding, the queen Vespula vulgaris <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, both {{building}} and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during {{the very beginning of}} the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.|$|E
25|$|The Manx shearwater, {{like many}} other seabirds, visits its {{breeding}} colonies at night to reduce the chances of attack by aerial predators. Two aspects of its optical structure suggest that the eye of this species is adapted to vision at night. In the shearwater's eyes the lens <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relative flat and so of low refractive power. In a diurnal bird like the pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ratio of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon; the figure for the shearwater is consistent with that {{for a range of}} nocturnal birds and mammals.|$|E

500|$|Using an {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "The River City", Jacksonville has a culture {{centered on the}} St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commercial center of downtown.

500|$|As {{the tenth}} Disney Princess, several critics have drawn {{comparisons}} between Rapunzel and preceding Disney Princesses and animated heroines, {{the most frequent}} and prominent of whom remains Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989).

Jonathan Crocker of Total Film noted similarities between Rapunzel and Ariel, describing Rapunzel as [...] "A strong-willed heroine longing to see outside." [...] Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune commented on Rapunzel's innocence, describing it as [...] "reminiscent of Amy Adams' flighty Giselle from ... Enchanted." [...] LoveFilm's Tom Charity commented on the character's independence, likening Rapunzel's spirited personality to those of both Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and the title character of Mulan (1998). Charity also labeled Rapunzel [...] "another addition to the more recent Disney tradition of emancipated heroines".|$|E

500|$|Meena Rupani of DesiHits was {{complimentary}} of the song's club appeal, but did {{not feel}} that the song was a standout or memorable track. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust had mixed opinions of the song.

[...] St. Asaph was complimentary of its melodramatic style, and added that [...] "The xx sample <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy drifting here, but it's well-used–notice how the vocals of the original become backing vocals for Rihanna with almost no adulteration." [...] However, she was critical of how the song's composition builds, writing that instead of starting quietly and building to its [...] "bombast", it starts somewhere between quiet and loud and ends past [...] its [...] "bombast". As a sidenote, St. Asaph noted that Rihanna does not in fact sound drunk on the song, but wrote that it does not affect the outcome. Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media was critical of the song, labeling the chorus as [...] "weak" [...] and Rihanna's vocal performance as too [...] "bombast" [...] for the xx's [...] "laid-back" [...] sample.|$|E
