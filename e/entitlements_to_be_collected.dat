40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} that the witness {{protection}} is a subjective, public right and is a result of protection of fundamental human rights. It is fundamental, public, individual, positive, directly relative and indirectly absolute right. The following entitlements stem from the fundamental right of witness <b>to</b> protection: a) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> informed about one’s right <b>to</b> protection; b) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> demand or waive one’s right <b>to</b> protection; c) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> withhold one’s personal details, testimony in full or answers to particular questions until the decision <b>is</b> made as <b>to</b> his request for protection; d) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> two-instance decision on one’s request; e) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> have a proxy; f) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> enjoy protection. The analysis of procedural witness protection in the comparative law shows that the witness in some countries does not have certain entitlements. On the other side, some entitlements are generally recognized. Certain differencies are understandable and acceptable, but not all of them. It <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> work on the realization of all entitlements that can be derived from subjective right to witness protection.

50|$|In the Parliament of Australia, the {{political}} parties appoint party whips to ensure party discipline, help manage legislative business and carry out {{a variety of other}} functions on behalf of the party leadership. The most important function of a government party whip <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that sufficient number of members and senators <b>are</b> present <b>to</b> take part in votes in the chamber, and to maintain a parliamentary quorum and to prevent censure motions succeeding. Their roles in the chamber include taking divisions, and arranging pairs which affects the ability of members and senators to leave parliament during sittings, as well as the <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> absent during divisions.|$|R
50|$|There {{is concern}} that {{families}} transferring to Universal Credit {{as part of}} the managed migration whose <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> UC <b>is</b> substantially lower than their existing benefits and tax credits might <b>be</b> reluctant <b>to</b> move into work or increase their hours if this would trigger a loss of transitional protection, thereby undermining the UC incentives structure.|$|R

50|$|The {{defendant}} was of low intelligence. She believed that her <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> compensation stemmed from not {{being paid to}} do the work she <b>was</b> employed <b>to</b> do prior to her accident. It was argued that she therefore lacked the dishonest intent required by the statutes. The trial judge had directed that the belief <b>to</b> <b>entitlement</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest and reasonable. The Crown asserted this was either the correct direction on the plain reading of the statute or that, in line with other common law jurisdictions, the court ought to read in such a requirement.|$|R

5000|$|This {{definition}} defines {{virtually any}} public service as being [...] "provided {{on a commercial}} basis" [...] and is already extending into such areas as police, the military, prisons, the justice system, public administration, and government. Over a fairly short time perspective, this could open up for the privatisation or marketisation of large parts, and possibly all, of what today are considered public services currently available for the whole population of a country as a social <b>entitlement,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restructured, marketised, contracted out to for-profit providers, and eventually fully privatised and available {{only to those who}} can pay for them.

40|$|The {{needs and}} {{experiences}} of employed people having treatment to become parents have been neglected in research and policy to support work and family. However, conflict between work and non-work life <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particularly problematic for the annual estimated 45, 000 people in the UK undergoing the long, physically and psychologically demanding process of fertility treatment.

Through in depth interviews with 37 employees who were having or had recently had treatment (including 31 women and six men) this research aimed to: i) explore the experiences of combining work and treatment; ii) identify perceived barriers to and supports for the successful combination of work and treatment; and iii) explore how employees having treatment define their situations in terms of their expectations and perceived sense of <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> workplace supports. Preliminary themes identified using thematic analysis included: combining work and treatment, disclosure, support for combining work and treatment and perceived sense of <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supported...|$|R
