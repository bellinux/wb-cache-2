5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this {{might be described as}} alert, clouded, <b>drowsy,</b> or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be <b>drowsy</b> at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|In prison, Sideshow Bob calls local right-wing {{talk show}} host Birch Barlow and {{complains}} about being unfairly imprisoned. Barlow and Springfield's residents pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob is soon unveiled as the Republican candidate for the Springfield mayoral election. Determined to keep Sideshow Bob from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby. Unfortunately, due to Sideshow Bob's charisma and Mayor Quimby's <b>drowsy,</b> overmedicated appearance at a televised debate, Sideshow Bob wins the election by a massive margin.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{performed}} by musical group the <b>Drowsy</b> Drivers, the show achieved rapid success from its low-budget premiere at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where it enjoyed a sold-out run and won an unprecedented three festival awards. In 2006, Neil Armfield directed an extended Company B production of Keating!, now with two acts and six new songs written by Bennetto. The Company B production toured Australia, receiving favourable reviews and winning Helpmann Awards for Best Musical and Best Regional Touring Production. In 2008 a live {{recording of the}} show was broadcast nationally on ABC2; it was released on DVD in November 2008, through Madman Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often <b>drowsy,</b> pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a <b>drowsy</b> state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{had just}} a single {{sandwich}} and one can of lemonade on board. They also decided to allow the {{carbon dioxide in the}} air to build up beyond the normal 40 minutes to conserve oxygen but it resulted in making both men lethargic and <b>drowsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands alone, {{there were}} thirty-four cases of {{suspected}} primidone poisoning between 1978 and 1982. Out of these, Primidone poisoning {{was much less}} common than phenobarbital poisoning. Twenty-seven of those adult cases were reported to the Dutch National Poison Control Center. Out of these, one person taking it with phenytoin and phenobarbital died, twelve became <b>drowsy</b> and four were comatose.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder and {{centerline}} rumble strips {{are used}} to reduce lane departure crashes. Centerline rumble strips are used on undivided highways to reduce cross-over incidents and resultant head-on collisions. Shoulder rumble strips are used primarily to reduce run-off-road collisions. They alert distracted or <b>drowsy</b> drivers that they are leaving the roadway or crossing the centerline of the road. In this application, they are narrower {{and outside of the}} wheelpaths.|$|E

The Interview ended when Liddell asked the host who {{he would like to}} fight. UFC President Dana White, along with Liddell's head coach Scott VanGilder, explained that Liddell had pneumonia and had taken a large dose of sedatives the night before the interview.|$|E
25|$|Driver Fatigue: Numerous crashes are {{attributed}} to driver fatigue. Many fatal crossover crashes {{can be attributed to}} the drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Public awareness, rumble strips, and rest areas are all solutions to this problem. Landscaping, improved lighting, roadside and pavement reflective markings, and billboards which could be targeted toward <b>drowsy</b> drivers have been discussed as well. Median barriers may also be installed, but they cost around $80,000 to $1,000,000 per mile depending on the need to widen the road to accommodate the barrier.|$|E
25|$|Musicals {{from other}} English-speaking {{countries}} (notably Australia and Canada) often do well locally, and occasionally even reach Broadway or the West End (e.g., The Boy from Oz and The <b>Drowsy</b> Chaperone). South Africa has an active musical theatre scene, with revues like African Footprint and Umoja and book musicals, such as Kat and the Kings and Sarafina! touring internationally. Locally, musicals like Vere, Love and Green Onions, Over the Rainbow: the all-new all-gay... extravaganza and Bangbroek Mountain and In Briefs – a queer little Musical {{have been produced}} successfully.|$|E
25|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a {{relatively}} easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow <b>drowsy,</b> to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 PPM whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 PPM. Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are {{an indicator of the}} adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.|$|E
25|$|For {{the murders}} of his final three victims, Christie {{modified}} the gassing technique he had first used on Muriel Eady; he simply used a rubber tube connected to the gas pipe in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a bulldog clip. He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because {{he would have been}} overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide. The gas made his victims <b>drowsy,</b> after which Christie strangled them with a length of rope.|$|E
25|$|NREM Stage 1 (N1 – light sleep, somnolence, <b>drowsy</b> sleep – 5–10% {{of total}} sleep in adults): This is {{a stage of}} sleep that usually occurs between sleep and wakefulness, and {{sometimes}} occurs between periods of deeper sleep and periods of REM. The muscles are active, and the eyes roll slowly, opening and closing moderately. The brain transitions from alpha waves having a frequency of 8–13Hz (common in the awake state) to theta waves having a frequency of 4–7Hz. Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks, also known as positive myoclonus, {{may be associated with}} the onset of sleep during N1. Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage. During Non-REM1, humans lose some muscle tone and most conscious awareness of the external environment.|$|E
25|$|Jenny (Daisy Turner) starts {{corresponding}} with a {{man named}} David Cox on a social networking website. Jenny meets David in the woods, where he is revealed to be Silas. They have a picnic and when Silas sees Jenny drugging his glass of wine, he secretly swaps them. Silas sees Jenny searching through his bag and threatens her, causing her to run away. She becomes <b>drowsy</b> and falls to the ground. Silas strangles Jenny to death and takes the ring from her finger, before burying her body in the woods. Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), after he learns of her promiscuity. Silas attempts and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned.|$|E
25|$|Suchet left Molins de Rei in {{the early}} evening. Marching rapidly, his troops arrived {{in front of the}} Ordal {{position}} at 11:00 PM. To his amazement, he found that the Allies failed to post any pickets. Suchet hustled his troops across the unguarded bridge and moved them uphill toward the <b>drowsy</b> Allies. As the French troops moved forward, telltale noises aroused the interest of a Spanish cavalry patrol, which trotted forward to see what was happening. These horsemen were greeted by a blast of musketry, which awakened Adam's men. At the front of Harispe's division, General of Brigade Jean Mesclop led the 7th Line to the attack. Halfway up the hill, the 7th Line bumped into an entrenchment held by four Spanish infantry companies. The defenders fell back to a second field work higher up the hillside. After being joined by more Spaniards, these soldiers mounted a counterattack, which briefly pushed back the 7th Line.|$|E
25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly <b>drowsy.</b> For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E
25|$|Silas {{is angry}} with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) after hearing her give sexual health {{advice on the}} radio, and seeing her on the radio's webcam. Silas stops Lynsey from gaining a {{promotion}} by telling her place of work about the radio show. Silas attacks Lynsey but her screams alert her neighbours, causing him to flee. Lynsey realises that Silas was her attacker and confronts him on numerous occasions, but her allegation is ignored. Lynsey also accuses Silas of murdering India and his grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), begins to question Lynsey's allegations. Silas experiences a heart attack after Riley questions him. In hospital, Lynsey is assigned as Silas's nurse and withholds his treatment as she assumes he is feigning the attack. Silas later recovers. Silas sees Lynsey giving Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) weight loss drugs and secretly swaps them with his heart medication. Cheryl takes the medication more frequently to suppress her appetite. Whilst Cheryl is alone in her nightclub, she climbs upon the bar and becomes <b>drowsy,</b> causing her to fall. She is found unconscious by Lynsey and begins to recover in hospital. Lynsey is told by a doctor that tests showed a high amount of sedative in Cheryl's system. Silas makes Cheryl doubt Lynsey's state of mind when he tells her that he thinks Lynsey could be capable of swapping the drugs.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a <b>drowsy</b> pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E
