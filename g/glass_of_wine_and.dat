5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine,</b> <b>and</b> is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E
500|$|David, who {{selected}} the stock, was uncompromising in {{her choice of}} merchandise; despite its large range of kitchen implements, the shop did not stock either wall-mounted knife sharpeners or garlic presses. David wrote an article called [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless", refused to sell them, and advised customers who demanded them to go elsewhere. Not available elsewhere, by contrast, were booklets by David printed specially for the shop. Some of them were later incorporated into the collections of her essays and articles, An Omelette and a <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wine</b> <b>and</b> Is There a Nutmeg in the House? The shop was described in The Observer as: ...|$|E

50|$|The Orchid Pavilion {{inspired}} Emperor Yang (604-617) of the Sui dynasty {{to build}} his new imperial garden, the Garden of the West, near Hangzhou.

500|$|Green {{considers}} herself nerdy: [...] "When {{people first}} meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to acting. It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> a good book. [...] Boring, huh?" [...] She has expressed interest in taxidermy and entomology. She collects preserved skulls and insects.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Alice and Tony {{come back}} very late from their date {{and have a}} <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> Tony makes a toast. Though it is {{revealed}} that they both love each other very, very much, Alice has doubts as to whether a marriage of Tony and Alice's families could ever work out well. Tony insists that, if they love each other, it shouldn't matter, but Alice ignores him and tearfully shouts that it just would never work. She divulges how Grandpa could have been [...] "a very rich man," [...] but instead, he had an epiphany one day and rode the elevator right {{back down to the}} lobby of his building and quit work. Alice explains that her family is too odd to get along with any other.|$|E
2500|$|The priests {{celebrate}} Tamino's successes so far, {{and pray}} that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: [...] ""). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their [...] "final farewell." [...] (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino – [...] "" [...] Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria [...] "".) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: [...] ""). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him {{that he is not}} yet worthy of her.|$|E
60|$|Sir Louis swore a good deal, and stormed {{as much as}} he could. He drank, however, his two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> he got no more.

6000|$|The doctor {{went away}} to his dinner, and the baronet also had his in bed. He could not eat much, but he was allowed two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>and</b> also a little brandy in his coffee.
