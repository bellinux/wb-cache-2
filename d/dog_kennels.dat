5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks first removed {{the top of the}} chimney and then created a hole in its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's <b>dog</b> <b>kennels,</b> a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|E
5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai <b>Dog</b> <b>Kennels,</b> a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E

Visible remnants of that era include the <b>dog</b> <b>kennels</b> at {{the north of the}} ground, and a covered standing book-makers area which was removed in late-2010 due to asbestos. The Hobart Greyhound Racing Club (HGRC) used its considerable resources to build two grandstands at the TCA Ground which were both opened in September 1954 and the above-mentioned bookmakers area in 1951, {{at a time when the}} TCA were in considerable financial hardship.|$|E
25|$|Among {{facilities}} {{available on}} board Queen Mary, the liner featured two indoor swimming pools, beauty salons, libraries and children's nurseries {{for all three}} classes, a music studio and lecture hall, telephone connectivity to anywhere in the world, outdoor paddle tennis courts and <b>dog</b> <b>kennels.</b> The largest room onboard was the cabin class (first class) main dining room (grand salon), spanning three stories in height and anchored by wide columns. The cabin-class swimming pool facility spanned over two decks in height. This was the first ocean liner to be equipped with her own Jewish prayer roompart of a policy to show that British shipping lines avoided the racism evident {{at that time in}} Nazi Germany.|$|E
25|$|In June of the {{following}} year, Port Victor was again in the news, {{this time as the}} result of a rough passage from London to Sydney. On 28 May, the ship had run into a gale which tore away the topsails, while heavy seas smashed the port side of the upper bridge, wrecked the forward house on the bridge, and damaged one of the lifeboats. Sheep pens, hen coops, <b>dog</b> <b>kennels</b> and livestock on the ship's deck were swept overboard, and the passenger quarters, including the saloons and cabins, were flooded. A little over a year later, on 8 July 1889, the ship suffered a second accident when she ran aground on a reef off Restoration Island, northwest of Brisbane, on a coal-carrying voyage from Newcastle, NSW to Batavia. The ship was refloated without damage a few days later after the removal of about 200 tons of cargo.|$|E

500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the <b>dog</b> <b>kennels</b> were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on the San Joaquin River Delta. The set, imitating a {{southern}} prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida to take photographs and measurements, where Pearce had served his time. The structures that were built in Stockton included [...] barracks, a mess hall, the warden's quarters, a guard shack and <b>dog</b> <b>kennels.</b> The trees on the set were decorated with spanish moss that the producers took to the area. The construction soon attracted the attention of a county building inspector who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it [...] "condemned for code violations." [...] The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters [...] was filmed in Lodi, California. Meanwhile, the scene in which Luke is chased by bloodhounds and other exteriors were shot in Jacksonville, Florida, at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the Florida Department of Corrections.|$|E

500|$|In February 1991, U2 {{moved the}} album's {{recording}} sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting {{the house for}} ₤10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house [...] "Dog Town" [...] for the [...] "tackiness" [...] of its exterior <b>dog</b> <b>kennels,</b> and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house, with the recording room in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located {{within walking distance of}} Bono's and the Edge's homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head"—but three separate tracks, [...] "The Fly", [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station", were derived from it. During the writing of [...] "The Fly", Bono created a persona based on an oversized pair of black sunglasses that he wore to lighten the mood in the studio. The character, also named [...] "The Fly", evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom. Bono assumed this alter ego for the band's subsequent public appearances and live performances on the Zoo TV Tour.|$|E
2500|$|He {{stayed in}} Halifax for the {{duration}} (and was re-activated on {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War.) He was head of recruiting of Halifax men into the army and was based at Catterick Garrison between 1914 and 1918. An article [...] was written [...] in the Halifax Courier on 3 October 1914 when he was involved with the Harrow <b>Dog</b> <b>Kennels,</b> Halifax. Two dogs had been officially recruited at Halifax and given a constables number in the 1880s, so there was a long tradition of using them for whatever purpose long before other constabularies did. This tradition might well be the reason Harrow Kennels were considered important, and Richardson was known as being an advocate of the use of dogs to be properly trained in the detection of crime. Later in the local newspaper there were several articles about two Halifax Policemen who had joined up and were now in the trenches. A letter was written to the Chief Constable by them whilst serving with the British Expeditionary Force. They had written to Richardson thanking him for their Christmas gift. It was reported in a local newspaper on 20 December 1915 that [...] "several, but not many, temporary Constables were appointed to the Halifax Police stationed at Harrison Rd." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around about 1910 the Borough Police {{acquired}} four police horses. They {{were purchased}} {{and used for}} crowd control with the horses being stabled in the yard at the Harrison Road Police Station, having their names over their stable doors. Four horses were photographed in the Mounted Police Section in 1930 {{as part of the}} annual inspection of the Halifax Borough Police of that year by Sir Llewelyn Atcherley, His Majesty's Inspector of Police, with Chief Constable Richardson. The Suffragettes were holding meetings that often ended with crowd trouble and there were many strikes at local works and on the railways in the offing at Halifax. A year later a car was purchased for Halifax police use and bicycle use had reached a peak by this time. Also, a motorbike and sidecar unit was formed and based at Harrison Road. 1911 saw the first national census when the householder presented the census form as opposed to giving verbal details to an enumerator. On 18 May 1912 there was a special meeting of the Watch Committee and it was resolved 'That the Police Standing Orders be reprinted as amended and re-published to the Force.' This was an update of the booklet published on 7 May 1906 and reflected the improved conditions of the Police Force and reaffirmed that the Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to conform. On 11 July 1912 King George V and Queen Mary visited Clough Mill, a factory site near Halifax. This entailed a heavy police presence and a large amount of police activity to ensure their security. Alfred Richardson was later to become recognised for a particular police security procedure he created for this event which had the security and police activity highly organised. Always involved with Police Pensions, Alfred Richardson added to the Family Archives a newspaper article from Sheffield where a Quarter Sessions Judge gave police officers consideration where the house, free gas and coal were supplied when calculating that officer's pension. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined up as a Territorial, in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment which had a long-standing association with Halifax. He was the Assistant Provost Marshall and given the rank of Major. Alfred Richardson {{was in charge of the}} Harrow <b>Dog</b> <b>Kennels</b> near Halifax, which provided dogs for the war effort. During the early days of World War I, Chief Constable Alfred Herbert Richardson was in charge of the kennels. They provided dogs for use in the trenches, for scouting with soldiers and for use in sentry duty at isolated posts. [...] In 1914, he served with the 4th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment and as a Major was the Halifax Recruiting Officer with the Regiment.|$|E

The <b>dog</b> <b>kennel</b> facility also includes an area for birds, lizards, and fish. The first year LCAR opened, they rescued 100-plus animals, and 98 of the animals were adopted. Today, Loving Companions Animal Rescue, Inc. rescues and adopts over a 1000 animals annually.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} last stile {{and was now}} in the park proper. Several villagers were strolling about under the trees, and they looked at this newcomer, with his dark-coloured clothes and strangely-shaped hat, with some surprise. Nevertheless, he held uninterruptedly on his way {{until he reached the}} broad drive which led to the Abbey. He walked on the turf by the side of it, over the bridge which crossed the stream, through the inner iron gates, beyond which the village people were not allowed to pass, and so to the well-remembered spot. On his right was the house--a strange, uneven building, at times ecclesiastical, here and there domestic, always ancient, with its wings of cloisters running almost down to the moat which {{surrounded}} it. And just over the moat, crossed by that light iron handbridge, with its back against what he remembered as a plantation, but which had now become a wood, the little red brick cottage, smothered all over with creepers, its tiny garden ablaze with flowers, its empty rows of <b>dog</b> <b>kennels,</b> its deserted line of coops. David glanced for a moment at the drawn blinds of the Abbey. Then he crossed the footbridge and the few yards of meadow, lifted the latch of the gate and, walking up the gravel path, came to a sudden standstill. A man who was seated almost hidden by a great cluster of fox-gloves rose to his feet.|$|E
