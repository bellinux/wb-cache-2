25|$|To {{minimize}} {{the effects of}} muscle and neural stimulation, <b>electrosurgical</b> equipment typically operates in the radio frequency (RF) range of 100kHz to 5MHz.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA), {{which is}} conceptually analogous {{in some ways}} to surgery, uses low frequency (300kHz to 1MHz) radio wave energy to target tissue, causing coagulative necrosis. RFA achieves its effects at 40°C to 70°C unlike other <b>electrosurgical</b> devices which require 400°C to 600°C for efficacy.|$|E
25|$|There are {{wet and dry}} field <b>electrosurgical</b> devices. Wet {{field devices}} operate in a saline solution, or in an open wound. Heating is {{as a result of}} an {{alternating}} current that passes between two electrodes. Heating is usually greatest where the current density is highest. Therefore, it is usually the smallest or sharpest electrode that generates the most heat.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrosurgical</b> {{desiccation}} {{occurs when}} the electrode touches the tissue open to air, {{and the amount of}} generated heat is lower than that required for cutting. The tissue surface and some of the tissue more deep to the probe dries out and forms a coagulum (a dry patch of dead tissue). This technique may be used for treating nodules under the skin where minimal damage to the skin surface is desired.|$|E

Bovie, who developed the first <b>electrosurgical</b> device while employed at Harvard University.

2500|$|RF Electrosurgery is {{performed}} using a RF <b>electrosurgical</b> generator (also referred to as an <b>electrosurgical</b> unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes - a monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF electrosurgery is bipolar so [...] the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design.|$|E
2500|$|Cut/Coag Most wet field <b>electrosurgical</b> systems {{operate in}} two modes: [...] "Cut" [...] causes {{a small area}} of tissue to be vaporized, and [...] "Coag" [...] causes the tissue to [...] "dry" [...] (in the sense of {{bleeding}} being stopped). [...] "Dried" [...] tissues are killed (and will later slough or be replaced by fibrotic tissue) but they are temporarily physically intact after <b>electrosurgical</b> application. The depth of tissue death is typically a few millimeters near the contact of the electrode.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different <b>electrosurgical</b> procedures. [...] For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. [...] Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open circuit voltage in <b>electrosurgical</b> waveforms is typically in the range of 300–10,000 V peak-to-peak.|$|E
2500|$|In {{monopolar}} configuration {{the patient}} {{is attached to the}} dispersive electrode, a relatively large metal plate or a flexible metalized plastic pad which is connected to the RF generator or <b>electrosurgical</b> unit (ESU). The surgeon uses a pointed or blade shaped electrode called the [...] "active electrode" [...] to make contact with the tissue and exert a tissue effect...vaporization, and it's linear propagation called <b>electrosurgical</b> cutting, or the combination of desiccation and protein coagulation used to seal blood vessels for the purpose of Hemostasis. The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the current density rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Electrosurgery is the {{application}} of a high-frequency (radio frequency) alternating polarity, electrical current to biological tissue as a means to cut, coagulate, desiccate, or fulgurate tissue. (These terms are used in specific ways for this methodology—see below). Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. [...] <b>Electrosurgical</b> devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>electrosurgical</b> procedures, {{the tissue}} is heated by an {{electric}} current. [...] Although electrical devices {{that create a}} heated probe {{may be used for}} the cauterization of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery is usually used to refer to a quite different method than electrocautery. Electrocautery uses heat conduction from a probe heated to a glowing temperature by a direct current (much {{in the manner of a}} soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} such a machine is called a hyfrecator. This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brandname Hyfrecator for [...] "High Frequency Eradicator", but now serves generically to {{describe}} a general class of single-electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered <b>electrosurgical</b> machines intended mainly for office use. An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables.|$|E
2500|$|To prevent {{unintended}} burns, {{the skin}} is cleaned and a conductive gel is used to enhance the contact with the return electrode. Proper electrical grounding practices must be followed in the electrical wiring of the building. It is also recommended to use a modern <b>ElectroSurgical</b> Unit that includes a return electrode monitoring system that continuously tests for reliable and safe patient contact. [...] These systems interrogate the impedance of a split or dual-pad return electrode and will alarm out, disabling further generator output in case of fault. [...] Prior generators relied on single pad return electrodes and thus had no means of verifying safe patient connection. [...] Return electrodes should always have full contact with the skin and {{be placed on the}} same side of the body and close to the body part where the procedure is occurring.|$|E
2500|$|The {{monopolar}} instrument {{called an}} [...] "active electrode" [...] when energized, requires {{the application of}} another monopolar instrument called a [...] "dispersive electrode" [...] elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue. This dispersive electrode is frequently and mistakenly called a [...] "ground pad" [...] or [...] "neutral electrode". However virtually all currently available RF <b>electrosurgical</b> systems are designed to function with isolated circuits - the dispersive electrode is directly attached to the ESU, not to [...] "ground". The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, {{so it is not}} [...] "neutral". [...] The term [...] "return electrode" [...] is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, George F. Merson {{opened a}} {{facility}} in Edinburgh for the manufacturing, packaging and sterilizing of catgut, silk and nylon sutures. Johnson & Johnson acquired Mr. Merson’s company in 1947, {{and this was}} renamed Ethicon Suture Laboratories. In 1953 this became Ethicon Inc. In 1992, Ethicon was restructured, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. became a separate corporation. During the 1990s, Ethicon diversified into new and advanced products and technologies and formed four different companies under the Ethicon umbrella, each of which specialize in different products. In 2008 J announced it would acquire Mentor Corporation for $1 billion and merge its operations into Ethicon. In March 2016, J Ethicon business unit announced it would acquire NeuWave Medical, Inc. In January 2017, J subsidiary Ethicon announced it would acquire Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets <b>electrosurgical</b> tools. [...] In February 2017, Ethicon acquired medical device manufacturer, Torax Medical for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

New types of endoscopes are available for ESD, such as an endoscope with a water jet system, an endoscope with a multi-bending system to facilitate the ESD procedure-. As another approach to successful ESD, investigations of submucosal injection solutions have been actively done.
