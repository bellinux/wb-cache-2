5000|$|Two {{weeks into}} the trial Lewis's attorneys, Don Samuel and <b>Ed</b> Garland, {{negotiated}} <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> agreement with the District Attorney where the murder charges against Lewis were dismissed {{in exchange for his}} testimony against Oakley and Sweeting, and his guilty <b>plea</b> to <b>a</b> misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice. Lewis admitted he gave a misleading statement to police on the morning after the killings (initially telling them that he was not at the scene). [...] Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner sentenced Lewis to 12 months' probation. One year in prison is the maximum sentence for a first-time offender, and the immediate probation was the judge's decision. He was also fined $250,000 by the NFL, which was believed to be the highest fine levied against an NFL player for an infraction not involving substance abuse. Under the terms of the sentence, Lewis could not use drugs or alcohol during the duration of the probation.|$|R

5000|$|In {{criminal}} {{trials in}} certain United States jurisdictions, it is <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> where the defendant neither admits nor disputes a charge, {{serving as an}} alternative to a pleading of guilty or not guilty. <b>A</b> no-contest <b>plea,</b> while not technically <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea,</b> has the same immediate effect as <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea</b> and is often offered as a part of <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain. In many jurisdictions <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of [...] is not a right and carries various restrictions on its use.|$|R
5000|$|In the Commonwealth countries—such as England and Wales, Canada, and Australia—the plea of [...] is not permitted. The {{defendant}} must enter <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty".

25|$|There {{were two}} issues {{as to the}} {{capacity}} of Bonjon for the jury to consider: firstly, whether Bonjon {{had the capacity to}} enter <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> to the jurisdiction; and secondly, whether Bonjon had the capacity to enter <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> to the general issue, that is, <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of guilty or not guilty.|$|R
40|$|This Note deals {{specifically}} with one particular {{aspect of the}} plea bargaining process in Nebraska: whether a criminal defendant {{has the right to}} withdraw <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of guilty or nolo contendere entered pursuant to <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain. In State v. Evans, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that not only is there no right to withdraw <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea</b> entered upon <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain, but, absent a manifest injustice, it is improper for a trial judge to permit the withdrawal of <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of guilty. This Note discusses the implications of this decision and examine alternatives which merit serious consideration...|$|R
5000|$|In Texas, {{the right}} to appeal the results of <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain taken from <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of either [...] or [...] "guilty" [...] is highly restricted. Defendants who have entered <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of [...] may only appeal the {{judgment}} of the court if the appeal is based on written pretrial motions ruled upon by the court.|$|R
50|$|A {{criminal}} case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a trial through <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain. Typically, in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain, the defendant agrees {{to plead guilty}} to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> bargain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>plea</b> bargaining, {{also called}} <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> {{agreement}} or negotiated <b>plea,</b> is <b>an</b> alternative and consensual way of criminal case settlement. <b>A</b> <b>plea</b> agreement means settlement of case without main hearing when the defendant agrees {{to plead guilty}} {{in exchange for a}} lesser charge or for a more lenient sentence and/or for dismissal of certain related charges.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>plea</b> of [...] "autrefois convict" [...] (Law French for [...] "previously convicted") is one {{in which}} the {{defendant}} claims to have been previously convicted of the same offence and that he or she therefore cannot be tried for it again. In the instance where a defendant has been summonsed to both criminal and civil proceedings, <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of autrefois convict is essentially an application to 'merge' proceedings, giving rise to res judicata or a cause of action estoppel in civil proceedings. This means that the secondary proceedings should not go ahead and the complaint stopped. <b>A</b> <b>plea</b> of autrefois convict can be combined with <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of not guilty.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> [...] <b>plea</b> has {{the same}} {{immediate}} effects as <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> of guilty, but may have different residual effects or consequences in future actions. For instance, a conviction arising from <b>a</b> [...] <b>plea</b> is subject to any and all penalties, fines, and forfeitures of a conviction from <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea</b> in the same case, and {{can be considered as}} an aggravating factor in future criminal actions. However, unlike <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea,</b> <b>a</b> defendant in <b>a</b> [...] <b>plea</b> may not be required to allocute the charges. This means that a [...] conviction typically may not be used to establish either negligence per se, malice, or whether the acts were committed at all in later civil proceedings related to the same set of facts as the criminal prosecution.|$|R
