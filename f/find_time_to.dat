5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
25|$|Although Bunning chaired many {{architectural}} {{and planning}} bodies, he did <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> support other interests, becoming {{a trustee of}} the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1958 and taking over as president from 1974 until his death of a cerebral tumour in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Since that time, Laird {{has been}} able to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> pursue some other comic book work, {{including}} publishing Stupid Heroes, and the graphic novel trilogy, Planet Racers, with Jim Lawson. Even this ties into the TMNT, however, since in seasons 3 and 6 of the 2003 TMNT series, episodes were based on the Planet Racers theme.|$|E

25|$|Zico {{retired from}} {{professional}} football during the 1994 season but received {{an invitation to}} play beach soccer, winning the Beach Soccer World Cup 1995. Scoring 12 goals, he was the top scorer and was named the best player of the tournament. He returned to Kashima to become the Antlers' technical adviser in 1995, splitting his time between Japan and Brazil – where he still managed to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> play beach soccer. One year later, in 1996, he founded CFZ (Zico Football Centre) in Rio de Janeiro. Zico founded another club, named CFZ de Brasília, in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} {{their next}} album, the band {{decided to take}} a break to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> focus on other projects. Nicke Andersson worked on his side project The Solution with Scott Morgan, releasing the album Communicate! in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for The Cardigans album Long Gone Before Daylight. Dahlqvist started a side project called Thunder Express and also recorded the album Fula Gubben Hitler with Swedish singer/songwriter Stefan Sundström; Dahlqvist was pictured on the album's cover suspended on a cross. Dahlqvist also toured along with former Hellacopters member Mattias Hellberg in support of the album.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} three seasons Foster could spare no time for cricket, apart from August 1905 (when he scored 246 on his first appearance), but in 1907 {{he was able to}} <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> play regularly from the beginning of June. His batting was as good as ever in a summer of appalling wickets and helped Worcestershire (fourteenth of sixteen counties in 1906) to rise to equal second with Yorkshire. He captained England in the three-match series against South Africa in 1907, winning one match and drawing two. Offered the captaincy of the MCC for the 1907/1908 Ashes tour, Foster declined because business commitments were monopolising his attention.|$|E

25|$|After further delays, Revolution {{announced}} on 5 November {{that the game}} will be released as a two-part episodic title, with the first episode coming on 4 December 2013, and the second one in Q1 2014. Initial releases would be for desktop platforms, and other releases would follow shortly after. Cecil explained that the game became much larger than they had anticipated, with enough content for two full-fledged games. This meant that the title would not be fully completed {{by the end of}} 2013, but Revolution had promised a 2013 release, and so came the decision to split the game in two. Cecil also added that sometimes games are too long, and players don't <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> finish it, and saw that a split would also benefit in this field. He compared the length of a single episode to that of The Smoking Mirror.|$|E
25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence {{and in front of}} a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E
500|$|The English {{script was}} nearly four {{megabytes}} in size, yet Working Designs completed the translation in only eight weeks after a marathon programming session. [...] During translation, the developers did <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> inject {{some of their}} own humor in to the game's text, dropping in sentences such as Have you ever tried swimming in lemon jello?, and numerous light-hearted pop culture references not seen in the original version, including allusions to American commercials, celebrities, colloquialisms, products, and role-playing game clichés.|$|E

500|$|At age twelve, Strang {{was baptized}} a Baptist. [...] He {{did not wish}} to follow his father's calling as a farmer, so he took up the study of law. [...] Strang was {{admitted}} to the bar in New York at age 23 and later at other places where he resided. He became county Postmaster and edited a local newspaper, the Randolph Herald. Later, {{in the midst of his}} myriad duties on Beaver Island, he would <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> found and publish the Daily Northern Islander, the first newspaper in northern Michigan.|$|E
500|$|McEwan's {{earlier work}} has {{explored}} {{the fragility of}} existence using a clinical perspective, Hitchens hails him a [...] "chronicler of the physics of every-day life". Saturday explores the feeling of fulfilment in Perowne: he is respected and respectable but not quite at ease, wondering about the luck that has him where he is and others homeless or in menial jobs. The family is materially well-off, with a plush home and a Mercedes, but justifiably so—Perowne and his wife work hard. McEwan tells of his success rate and keeping cool under pressure; there is a trade off, {{as he and his}} wife work long hours and need to put their diaries side by side to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend together.|$|E
500|$|Don Turnbull of White Dwarf {{magazine}} {{gave the}} three separate modules comprising the G-series 9/10 overall. Turnbull was impressed that Gygax {{was able to}} <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write them while also creating ADs rules, saying [...] "Things are really buzzing at TSR." [...] He felt {{the presentation of the}} modules was done well, with easily read maps, although he preferred the black and white maps of the first module to the blue and white maps of the later two. Turnbull found the module's level of detail to be an improvement over previous Dungeons & Dragons scenarios which gave the Dungeon Master (DM) too little information. The review declared the modules [...] "very tough", stating that [...] "the notes suggest nine characters or so, each of ninth level or better and each with two or three relevant magic items." ...|$|E

500|$|Owing to {{the scale}} of the atrocities, US embassy staff had sent telegrams {{indicating}} that a genocide was occurring. One, which became known as the Blood telegram, was sent by Archer Blood, the US Consul General in Dhaka, and was signed by him as well as US officials from USAID and USIS who at the time were serving in Dhaka. In it, the signatories denounced American [...] "complicity in Genocide". In an interview in 1972, Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, justified the use of military intervention, saying, [...] "Shall we sit and watch their women get raped?" [...] The events were discussed extensively in the British House of Commons. John Stonehouse proposed a motion supported by a further 200 members of parliament condemning the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani armed forces. Although this motion was presented twice before parliament, the government did not <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> debate it.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 7, 2010, Uematsu {{announced}} the band had formally disbanded. He {{did not directly}} state {{the reason for the}} decision, though in previous interviews he had noted the band was increasingly finding it difficult to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rehearse together. In an April 2011 interview he said the main reason was because The Black Mages had been formed as a [...] "Square Enix" [...] band, they were unable to perform arrangements of work he had composed after leaving Square Enix or to focus on original pieces. Uematsu continues to play rock arrangements of his music {{as a part of the}} band the Earthbound Papas, which performed at the Distant Worlds II concert in 2010. He has been joined by fellow Black Mages bandmates Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda, both continuing on guitar and drums, respectively. They had also left Square Enix; Uematsu built the new band to not include any current Square Enix employees so as to avoid the trademark and licensing problems of The Black Mages.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{commentaries on}} I Corinthians (1551), Romans (1558), and Judges (1561) during his lifetime. He was criticized by {{his colleagues in}} Strasbourg for withholding his lectures on books of the Bible for years rather than sending them to be published. Calling his lecture notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and the Minor Prophets [...] "brief and hasty annotations", he {{found it difficult to}} <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare them for publication. His colleagues edited and published some of his remaining works on the Bible after his death: prayers on the Psalms (1564) and commentaries on Kings (1566), Genesis (1569), and Lamentations (1629). Vermigli followed the humanist emphasis on seeking the original meaning of scripture, as opposed to the often fanciful and arbitrary allegorical readings of the medieval exegetical tradition. He occasionally adopted an allegorical reading to interpret the Old Testament as having to do with Christ typologically, but he did not utilize the quadriga method of medieval biblical interpretation, where each passage has four levels of meaning. Vermigli's command of Hebrew, as well as his knowledge of rabbinic literature, surpassed that of most of his contemporaries, including Calvin, Luther, and Zwingli.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{deployment}} to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose had died, and twelve days later, their son Christopher was born. [...] Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers {{to write a}} book about the war, deciding upon the title Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written [...] "anything in prose or verse since I got here—except statistics—but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a chance." [...] Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did <b>find</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write prose sketches and poetry. [...] The most notable of his poems during this period was [...] "Rouge Bouquet" [...] (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. [...] At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918 that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).|$|E
