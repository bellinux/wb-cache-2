30|$|All of us face {{self-control}} {{problems from}} time to time. Whitman (2006) argues {{that we can find}} ways to solve, or at least mitigate, those problems. One way is to make deals with <b>ourselves.</b> <b>For</b> instance, we can reward <b>ourselves</b> <b>for</b> good behavior and punish <b>ourselves</b> <b>for</b> bad behavior, make promises and advertise them to friends and families, or make commitments to change our own behavior.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act, and that those actions do have real consequences <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> and for others. Our view of God {{is important because it}} embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{distinctive}} feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{as though we}} were inspecting it from the outside.

25|$|In his introduction, Mailer details his {{conflicted}} {{attitude toward}} the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one. This claim, however, might just be a way for Mailer to mitigate any negative criticism and show modesty by denying his abilities, or as a ruse {{to get us to}} discover <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> whether Mailer can write a good short story.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 30, in 1813, Lawrence {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1815, he was {{appointed}} Professor of Anatomy and Surgery by the College of Surgeons. His lectures started in 1816, and the set was published the same year. The book was immediately attacked by Abernethy and others for materialism, and for undermining the moral welfare of the people. One of the issues between Lawrence and his critics concerned the origin of thoughts and consciousness. For Lawrence, as <b>for</b> <b>ourselves,</b> mental processes were {{a function of the}} brain. John Abernethy and others thought differently: they explained thoughts as the product of vital acts of an immaterial kind. Abernethy also published his lectures, which contained his support for John Hunter's vitalism, and his objections to Lawrence's materialism.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think <b>for</b> <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E

Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if we could go out and see <b>for</b> <b>ourselves.</b> I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard von Weizsäcker {{took office}} as President on 1 July 1984. In his inaugural address, he appealed to his nation's special consciousness, saying: [...] "Our situation, which {{differs from that}} of most other nations, is no reason to deny {{ourselves}} a national consciousness. To do so would be unhealthy <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> and eerie to our neighbors." [...] He dedicated his first years in office mainly to foreign policy, travelling widely with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and choosing former Foreign Office employees as his personal advisors.|$|E
500|$|As Madsen has described, Cisneros's [...] "effort to {{negotiate}} a cross-cultural identity {{is complicated by the}} need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures." [...] The lives of all Cisneros’s female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: [...] "There's always this balancing act, we've got to define what we think is fine <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> instead of what our culture says." ...|$|E

500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell you I was mad, mad clean through. We needed water <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{pathologist}} {{examined the}} boy's body, {{but there was}} no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad. In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: [...] "We have some secrets <b>for</b> <b>ourselves.</b> We cannot give anything... everything." [...] According to Jamal al-Durrah, five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman. In 2013 he said, without elaborating: [...] "The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the year, {{they moved}} into a {{communal}} apartment with Berkman's cousin, Modest Aronstam (referred to as [...] "Fedya" [...] in both Berkman's Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist and Goldman's Living My Life), and Goldman's friend, Helene Minkin, along principles inspired by What Is to Be Done? Living according to the example of Rakhmetov, Berkman denied himself even the smallest pleasures—and he expected his comrades to be the same. Aronstam, on the other hand, occasionally brought home flowers. Frictions between the two grew: [...] "Every penny spent <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> was so much taken from the Cause," [...] Berkman fumed. [...] "Luxury is a crime, a weakness." [...] With time, however, the two cousins reconciled.|$|E

[...] Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: [...] "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us.... Since the court has settled with them, who will support us? Let us unite to strike back at them, to take <b>for</b> <b>ourselves</b> a piece of land on which we can fight for our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do <b>for</b> <b>ourselves.</b> It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record <b>for</b> <b>ourselves,</b> not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
