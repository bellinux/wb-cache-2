Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E

5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E

25|$|In the wild, {{the diet}} of {{goldfish}} consists of crustaceans, insects, and various plant matter. Like most fish, they are opportunistic feeders {{and do not}} stop eating on their own accord. Overfeeding can be deleterious to their health, typically by blocking the intestines. This happens most often with selectively bred goldfish, which have a convoluted intestinal tract. When excess <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> they produce more waste and faeces, partly due to incomplete protein digestion. Overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca.|$|E
25|$|Short-tailed bats are {{omnivorous}} and opportunistic, {{feeding on}} whatever <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> in their environments. They forage {{in areas of}} dense forest and deep leaf litter, and may travel considerable distances from roosting to foraging sites each night. Their wings have a low aspect ratio and low wing loading, suggesting high manoeuvrability and moderate flight speed, suitable both for long travel and foraging close to the ground. They {{have been reported to}} eat insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, fruit, nectar, and pollen.|$|E

25|$|The harsh {{environment}} in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its energetics. In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials. They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals. The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy. As long as enough <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.|$|E

500|$|Potter uses {{elevated}} language {{again when}} the rabbit family is described as [...] "improvident and cheerful". Though [...] "improvident" [...] is not immediately defined, the cheerfulness of the family is made evident in the accompanying illustration of the bunnies romping in their burrow while their parents look upon their offspring with placid contentment. Their improvidence is suggested however {{in the next two}} pages of text which describe Benjamin's borrowing of cabbages from his cousin Peter, and the family's occasional resort to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap in times when Peter cannot spare any cabbages. Mr. McGregor and the rubbish heap are enduring constants in the rabbit universe of the tale, and because they are, the threat of starvation in the line [...] "... there was not always enough to eat" [...] is mitigated. Benjamin and Flopsy may not always be able to provide for their family, but <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> even if it is not theirs by right. [...] "Improvident" [...] then is defined by course of action, and the lack of an immediate definition nonetheless carries the narrative forward and the reader's curiosity about its meaning is satisfied.|$|E

40|$|Bonobos (Pan paniscus) tend to {{have low}} {{frequencies}} of aggression due to a suite of affiliative behaviors that are thought to relieve group tensions. A few of these possible behaviors are grooming, sociosexual activities, and strategic positioning in regards to proximity with other individuals at food sites, where most aggression occurs. This observational study sought to determine whether captive bonobos exhibit certain social behaviors at different rates, and have differing proximity preferences in regards to other individuals, when <b>food</b> <b>was</b> and <b>was</b> not <b>available.</b> Results show that when <b>food</b> <b>was</b> <b>available,</b> the apes <b>were</b> less affiliative with fewer counts of grooming, but with higher rates of sexual activity. In addition, animals {{were found to be}} in proximity with at least one group member less often when <b>food</b> <b>was</b> <b>available.</b> There <b>were</b> very few recorded aggression events throughout the study, and no significant difference in rates of aggression when <b>food</b> <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> not <b>available...</b>|$|R
2500|$|There is {{a growing}} {{realization}} among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> but unaffordable.

2500|$|Cavefish {{are quite}} small with most species being less than [...] long {{and very few}} able to surpass [...] At up to about , the blind cave eel is the longest known cavefish. The very limited food {{resources}} in the habitat likely prevents larger cavefish species from existing and also means that cavefish in general are opportunistic feeders, taking whatever is available. In their habitat, cavefish are often the top predators, feeding on smaller cave-living invertebrates, or are detritivores without enemies. Cavefish typically have low metabolic rates and {{may be able to}} survive long periods of starvation. A captive Phreatobius cisternarum did not feed for a year, but remained in good condition. The cave form of the Mexican tetra can build up unusually large fat reserves by [...] "binge eating" [...] in periods where <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> which then (together with its low metabolic rate) allows it to survive without food for months, much longer than the aboveground form of the species.|$|E
