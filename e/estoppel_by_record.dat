2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same.

5000|$|The {{status of}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel.

2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: [...] the former is based on {{representation of}} existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter {{is based on a}} promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future).

50|$|It is {{debatable}} whether <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> convention {{is a separate}} estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of reliance-based <b>estoppel</b> (<b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation would be its most frequent form), or {{of the rule of}} interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see Amalgamated Investment and Property Co.

50|$|A {{representation}} {{can be made}} by statement or conduct. Although {{the representation}} must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises. Under English law, <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account unconscionability under <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.|$|R
50|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> acquiescence is applied when one party gives legal notice {{to a second}} party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party {{is said to have}} acquiesced to the claim, and is estopped from later challenging it, or making a counterclaim. The doctrine is different from <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> laches to the extent that a lache may be involuntary but acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of aquiescence.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there is}} some debate as to whether [...] "unconscionability" [...] is an element that English courts need {{to take into account}} when {{considering}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do.

5000|$|A plea of [...] "autrefois acquit" [...] is one {{in which}} the {{defendant}} claims to have been previously acquitted for the same offence and thus should not be tried again.
