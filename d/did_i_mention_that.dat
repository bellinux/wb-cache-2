60|$|<b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> he {{had always}} one eye wide open, and one eye nearly shut; and that the one eye nearly shut was always the {{expressive}} eye? I don't think I did.|$|E
60|$|<b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> the Pepperleigh family, generations ago, {{had taken}} up land near the Aroostook, {{and that it was}} from there the judge's father came to Tecumseh township? Perhaps not, but it doesn't matter.|$|E
60|$|When I am totally prostrated (<b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> I {{was totally}} prostrated by Marian's letter?) it always takes me {{three days to}} get up again. I was very unreasonable--I {{expected}} three days of quiet. Of course I didn't get them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} him take them from his hat and slip them into his coat-tail pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> shouldn't mind turning {{my hand to}} it sometimes,' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; 'but it wouldn't pay by itself, you know.' ...|$|R
60|$|Unluckily, I {{never cared}} a cent for {{anything}} but art, and never shall. My idea of man's chief end was to enrich the world with things of beauty, and have a fairly good time myself while <b>doing</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> second part, {{which is the only}} one I have managed to carry out; but my father must have suspected the suppression, for he branded the whole affair as self-indulgence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a pity you didn't say so, in good time, is it not?' {{retorted}} Carker, coolly. 'However, I think it's {{all for the}} best. I really, think it's all for the best. <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} something like a little confidence between Miss Dombey and myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Marian smiled. [...] "Perhaps {{it would}} have been unreasonable, but taking it for granted that he hasn't been communicative, I've a piece of news for you. Some Canadian {{tourists}} stayed a night at the Ghyll, two or three months ago, and it seems they met him in British Columbia. I understand he is by no means prosperous, but at least getting a footing in the country, and the people apparently have rather a high opinion of him. <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> one of the party was a girl?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On their {{official}} page in late 2006, the band announced {{a change of}} label through a news post by bassist Scott McGuire; [...] "Also, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a new}} record label in the picture? That's right, we have signed to Sire Records." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have it in}} {{my heart}} to wish that you did; for I, M. de Luynes, seek to make a friend of you. Nay, do not smile in that unbelieving fashion. I have long esteemed you for those very qualities of dauntlessness and {{defiance}} which have brought you so rich a crop of hatred. If you doubt my words, perhaps you will recall my attitude towards you in the horse-market yesterday, and let that speak. Without wishing {{to remind you of}} a service <b>done,</b> <b>I</b> may yet <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stood betwixt you and the mob that sought to avenge my friend Canaples. He was my friend; you stood there, as indeed you have always stood, in the attitude of a foe. You wounded Canaples, maltreated Vilmorin, defied me; and yet but for my intervention, mille diables sir, you had been torn to pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But toward {{evening the}} gurgling beneath me ceased, and I {{could see that}} the rudder no longer parted the quiet water, and that we had ceased to move. A flash of hope blazed up within me. Had the Water-devil found the ship too heavy a load, and had he given up the attempt to drag it to its under-ocean cave? I went below and had my supper; I was almost a happy man. When Miss Minturn came to ask me how we were getting along, I told her that I thought we were doing very well indeed. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> we had ceased to move, for she thought that a {{favorable}} symptom. She went back to her quarters greatly cheered up. Not so much, I think, from my words, as from my joyful aspect; for <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel jolly, there was no doubt about it. If that Water-devil had let go of us, I was willing to take all the other chances that might befall a ship floating about loose on the Bay of Bengal.|$|R
60|$|My dear Brothers--I am {{extremely}} {{sorry to}} have given you so much uneasiness by not writing; however, you know good news is no news or vice versâ. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like to write a short letter to you, or {{you would have had}} one long before. The weather although boisterous to-day has been very much milder; and I think Devonshire is not the last place to receive a temperate Change. I have been abominably idle since you left, but have just turned over a new leaf, and used as a marker a letter of excuse to an invitation from Horace Smith. The occasion of my writing to-day is the enclosed letter--by Postmark from Miss W----[49] Does she expect you in town George? I received a letter the other day from Haydon, in which he says, his Essays on the Elgin Marbles are being translated into Italian, the which he superintends. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had seen the British Gallery, there are some nice things by Stark, and Bathsheba by Wilkie, which is condemned. I could not bear Alston's Uriel.|$|R
5000|$|A {{photo of}} Cote de Pablo's character, Ziva, {{appearing}} as a bar singer undercover became {{a subject of}} interest before the episode aired. Brennan addressed questions raised: [...] "Without giving away too many secrets, the answer to why Ziva {{is dressed in a}} sexy, backless dress and singing in a smoky bar will be answered in the opening moments of the season 6 premiere, so fans won’t have to wait long to find out the 'why' of it. But I can divulge one more piece of the puzzle: the 'where' of it. The bar is in Morocco. And <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> in the opening episode a member of Gibbs' team gets blown away?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after, {{they joined}} the roster of High Road Touring, a San Francisco-based booking agency. For their first U.S. tour in 2004, Menomena drove a 1977 Dodge Sportsman RV. The aging vehicle {{suffered}} many breakdowns along the way. Knopf detailed these issues {{in an interview in}} Spin: [...] "Systems that failed (and had to be replaced) during the tour included the following: tires, muffler, brake, master cylinder, exhaust manifold, windshield wipers, horn, side-view mirrors (both fell off). Oh, and <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> there were two fires? Not one. Two. This vehicle promptly earned the moniker 'RV Danger.'" [...] RV Danger (most likely a reference to Seattle band Harvey Danger) was later immortalized in a tour poster illustrated by Tyler Stout, who has collaborated with the band on numerous occasions. Other notable tours in Menomena's early career were with Gang of Four, The National, and The Long Winters.|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Alejandro Del Carmen for his instruction, guidance, and {{infinite}} wisdom throughout my tenure at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Moreover, my participation in the Criminology & Criminal Justice (CRCJ) program {{would not have been possible}} without his convincing me to transfer to CRCJ from another program. I {{would like to}} thank Scott Santiago. I have no greater friend than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in him. Scott and I have been through both good and bad times, triumph and tragedy during our time at UTA. We have helped each other during these difficult times, and in the process of research and study. I would be remiss if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> through Scott, <b>I</b> was given the opportunity to make the acquaintance of Dr. Del Carmen. I would like to extend my earnest gratitude to the members of my committee. Dr. Del Carmen, thank you for accepting my invitation to lead my committee and for agreeing to be my thesis advisor. Dr. Paris, thank you for your wisdom, knowledge of international relations, and your unique perspective on CRCJ. Thank you for agreeing on short notice to be a member of my committee. Dr. Ahmad, although I never had the pleasure of your instruction, I appreciate your willingness to be a member of my committee, and to take on such a task on very short notice...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was on my}} way to Branscombe, and inquired the distance.|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} lady {{in her own}} sitting room. She started and looked annoyed when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Sergeant Cuff wished to speak to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "My granddaughter {{will marry}} Lord Harbinger. <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Courtier, for your peace of mind. You are {{a man of}} honour; it will go no further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} about all that," [...] he replied. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Mary was a {{practical}} girl. Possibly she had thought of these details." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked down}} at me from under his {{beautiful}} eyelashes (have <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a little woman?), and he asked in his persuasive tones: [...] "Must we say good-by?" ...|$|R
60|$|Merriman. Yes, Miss. He {{seemed very}} much disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> you and Miss Prism {{were in the}} garden. He said he was anxious {{to speak to you}} privately for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... 301 I hope I am not betraying {{a cabinet}} secret if <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> this [...] {{committee}} {{was composed of}} Mr. Gladstone, Lord Spencer, Lord [...] Herschell, Mr. Campbell-Bannermann, Mr. Bryce, and myself.|$|R
6000|$|Robert {{answered}} very unwillingly. [...] "I {{took the}} liberty of reminding her ladyship that she had left her letter unsealed," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> as my excuse for speaking,"--he stopped, and corrected himself--"I believe <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> a valuable inclosure was in the letter." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> we had dinner, {{not because}} I {{think that the}} {{information}} will prove exciting to the reader, but because I wish to warn my countrymen, travelling in Germany, against undue indulgence in Liptauer cheese.|$|R
5000|$|... "Teea Goans is {{the whole}} package...good looks, great voice and a style that is steeped in {{tradition}} and yet as fresh as this morning’s sunrise. And <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> she's country with a capital [...] "C?" [...] - Bill Anderson, /Grande Ole Opry / Country Music Hall Of Fame ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are. Now {{and then}} you are also a little crude, which is {{probably}} what you mean. Still, that's not the question. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should sooner you didn't come to supper this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} full value for your goods," [...] Scopus {{said when they}} left the shop--"that was why <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> you had entered Nero's household, for it is a great thing to have a friend at court." ...|$|R
6000|$|Waynefleet {{rose and}} turned to the girl. [...] "I'll put on my rubber overshoes," [...] he announced. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have to go out, it's a pity you didn't think of laying out my coat to warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} the {{interest}} in the matter will be diminished, colonel, when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> the charge was executed at night, and that I was ignorant of {{the vicinity of the}} French until I rode into the middle of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} my honour, madam, <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>I</b> don't know what. <b>I</b> but <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Warrington had lost a pocket-book {{containing}} letters, and my lady swooned, as you see." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{were given}} 100 Windows-based {{computers}} by Taiwan. The education sector uses predominantly Apple Macintosh computers, so <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> we may also need software. Taiwan immediately delivered 100 brand new copies of Windows XP, {{and offered to}} train our computer technicians." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} little soldier quietly, [...] "it is a {{confirmation}} of several things I {{have heard of}} lately. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> the bush was not a desirable place for you to wander in. Still, you are probably going back there again?" ...|$|R
60|$|After I {{had drunk}} {{half a dozen}} glasses, my policy of temperateness in mind, I decided that I had had enough for <b>that</b> time. So <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going aboard the Razzle Dazzle, then lying at the city wharf, a hundred yards away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Waters; [...] "she didn't do that." [...] Colville {{imagined a}} consciousness in him, which perhaps did not exist. [...] "She didn't allude {{to the subject}} further than to state the fact, when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was coming to see you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Anaimangalam {{copperplate}} of Kulothunga Chola <b>I</b> <b>mentions</b> <b>that</b> Kasiba Thera (Buddhist Monk) renovated {{the shrine}} in 6th century AD {{with the help}} of monks of [...] "Naganadu" [...] (Nagapattinam). The Pallava King Rajasimha (690 - 728) permitted a Chinese king to build Buddha vihara in Nagappattinam.|$|R
60|$|When I {{closed my}} {{letter of the}} 12th, <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Sir Robert Napier had written to Theodore, urging him most {{strongly}} to surrender, as he had no possibility of a successful resistance; {{and the destruction of}} life, if we were to open fire upon Magdala, would be terrible.|$|R
