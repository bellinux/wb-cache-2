50|$|<b>Durene,</b> or 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H2(CH3)4. It is a colourless solid {{with a sweet}} odor.

50|$|Traditional {{methanol}} to gasoline technologies produce diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas.

The STG+ technology also incorporates <b>durene</b> reduction into its core process, meaning that the entire fuel production process requires only two steps: syngas production and gas to liquids synthesis. Other methanol to gasoline processes do not incorporate <b>durene</b> reduction into the core process, and they require the implementation of an additional refining step.|$|E
50|$|From 1936 the <b>Dürener</b> Metallwerke (suppliers to the {{military}} aircraft industry) established a plant in Waren, the Mecklenburgische Metallwarenfabrik Waren or Memefa, which belonged to the Quandt Group.

50|$|The {{upgrading}} of the Aachen-Düren-Cologne {{line and}} the related establishment of a S-Bahn line from Düren to Cologne led to a renewed increase {{in the importance of}} the Düren node. However, the Düren-Bedburg line was dismantled, the Düren-Euskirchen line was closed and the Düren-Jülich-Linnich and the Düren-Heimbach lines were sold to the <b>Dürener</b> Kreisbahn (Düren District Railway, DKB). Passenger and freight traffic on the latter lines was subsequently revitalised by the DKB. These services are now operated by Rurtalbahn.|$|R
50|$|The company {{decided in}} the {{beginning}} to use RegioSprinter class of railcars from Duewag {{that had already been}} ordered by <b>Dürener</b> Kreisbahn. This was originally a series of 6 and then a further series of 10 were ordered. Between 1998 and 1999, the second series were rebuilt so they could be used on the Zwickau train-tram lines, for example: brakelights, indicators and warning bells were needed. They needed switch equipment to activate the traffic lights to ensure a safe uninterrupted passage. In January 2004 the rest were converted. RegioSprinters were only suilable for short journeys, they had thinly upholstered seats in a 2+3 formation and no toilets, their top speed was 100 km/h, though later all the trains crossing the Czech border were refitted to a higher standard. RegioSprinters were used on VB 1, VB 5 and VB 2 lines and until December 2006 on VB 7, the line from Schönberg to Schleiz. Two of these trains were lent on a long term basis to the Prignitzer Eisenbahn for use around Oberhausen.|$|R

50|$|Dicyanoacetylene is a {{powerful}} dienophile because the cyanide groups are electron-withdrawing, {{so it is a}} useful reagent for Diels-Alder reactions with unreactive dienes. It even adds to the aromatic compound <b>durene</b> (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) to form a substituted bicyclooctatriene. Only the most reactive of dienophiles can attack such aromatic compounds.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{additional}} number of reactors, traditional methanol to gasoline processes include inefficiencies such as {{the additional}} cost and energy loss of condensing and evaporating the methanol prior to feeding it to the <b>durene</b> reduction unit. These inefficiencies {{can lead to a}} greater capital cost and environmental footprint than methanol to gasoline processes that use fewer reactors, such as STG+. The STG+ process eliminates multiple condensation and evaporation, and the process converts syngas to liquid transportation fuels directly without producing intermediate liquids. This eliminates the need for storage of two products, including pressure storage for liquefied petroleum gas and storage of liquid methanol.|$|E
