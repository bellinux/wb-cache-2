5|$|The eastern ends of English cathedrals show {{a greater}} {{diversity}} {{than those of}} any other country. Those built in the Norman era had high apsidal ends surrounded by a lower ambulatory, as is typical of Northern France.

5|$|Ipswich {{made only}} one major signing during the off-season, buying Hermann Hreiðarsson from Wimbledon F.C. for a club record £4m {{two days before}} the season commenced. Television pundits Rodney Marsh and Mark Lawrenson both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich {{surprised}} the doubters; they sustained a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League, when the team failed to win {{on the last day of}} the season against Derby County. The fifth-place finish gained the club a UEFA Cup place and earned George Burley the title of FA Premier League Manager of the Year, an award that until 2010 had, <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions.|$|E

5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat him {{on the floor of the}} Commons. However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose not to do so, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E

25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white on the dog. It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> way.|$|E

25|$|The buses {{changed the}} route, and {{continued}} from Rosenborg School down Nonnegata to Olav Trygvassons gate {{in the city}} centre, but not via the railway station. This was to reduce the travel time to the city from Rosenborg. They had a five-minute headway in rush hour, and eight minutes otherwise. From 16 December the line was driven in both directions. From February 1969 the buses were forced to drive via the station due the concession; this resulted <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> bus taking the former tram route via Singsaker to the city. This gave a 15-minute headway. The other route kept a 7–8 minute headway.|$|E

In the free program, he skated steadily but tentatively, eliminating the second jump from his first planned combination and doubling a planned triple jump on another combination. However, the program was strong enough for Weir to win his first World medal – a bronze – and kept the United States from being shut out of the medals at a World Championship {{for the first time since}} 1994.|$|E

25|$|Megazostrodon is {{the only}} {{well-known}} genus of the family Megazostrodontidae. The other members of this family that are currently known to science are Indozostrodon, Dinnetherium, Wareolestes and Brachyzostrodon. The megazostrodontids used to be classified {{as members of a}} group of mammals called the Triconodonts, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of reptiles (the cynodonts or 'mammal-like reptiles’) during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms just outside the Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. One must {{keep in mind that the}} distinction between true mammals and mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> way.|$|E

Of those losses, only one has been against a team other than New Zealand or Australia, when Wales won 7-12 in the 1975 tournament.
