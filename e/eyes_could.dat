5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Snake Eyes' body is {{stolen by}} the Red Ninjas, {{in order to}} resurrect him. The Joes track the Red Ninjas to China, where Sei-Tin takes control of Snake Eyes, and uses him to exact his revenge against Storm Shadow and Kamakura. They {{eventually}} defeat Sei-Tin and return Snake Eyes to normal. Shortly after, Scarlett observes Snake Eyes seemingly abandoning all of his ninja training, and focusing solely on his military training instead. Following the session, Scarlett unmasks Snake Eyes and is shocked at the sight. Later, Snake Eyes reveals to Scarlett and Stalker that the Baroness is still alive, and being held captive within the Rock, which leads them to confront General Colton. When ordered on a mandatory break, Snake Eyes and Kamakura go on a retreat to the High Sierras, where Kamakura tries to rationalize that Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>could</b> not have died, but must have put himself into a trance. He then argues that Snake Eyes should not have given up his ninja skills, and that he wishes {{to work with him}} to restore his faith. Snake Eyes returns to active duty, and investigates a medical facility with Stalker and Scarlett, where they find a fatally injured Scalpel. He informs them that the Baroness is free and looking for revenge on both G.I. Joe and Cobra.|$|E

Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: [...] "Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta" [...] ("Do you not long for our little cottage"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she {{recognises}} as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> be more beautiful than her own: [...] "Qual'occhio al mondo" [...] ("What eyes in the world").|$|E

500|$|Because of the crew's inexperience, filming was a [...] "comedy of errors". The {{first day}} of filming led to the crew getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge. Several crew members were injured during the shoot, {{and because of the}} cabin's remoteness, {{securing}} medical assistance was difficult. One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask. Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass had to be applied to the actors to achieve the [...] "demonic eyes" [...] effect. The lenses took ten minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about fifteen minutes because <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> not [...] "breathe" [...] with them applied. Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put [...] "Tupperware" [...] over their eyes.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{revealed}} which characters {{will appear}} on the opposing factions. They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's <b>eyes,</b> <b>could</b> be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- or you can just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E
500|$|Within {{hours of}} Toivonen's crash, Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to ban Group B cars from {{competing}} in the 1987 season. The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race. Audi and Ford withdrew from Group B racing immediately, but other teams competed {{until the end of}} the season. The Tour de Corse continued the next day and Bruno Saby won with his Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2. Prior to Santos' and Toivonen's crashes, many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars. FISA was criticised for recognising the problem too late. A FISA investigation later proved that drivers' reactions were too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars, and drivers' <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> not adjust their focus between the fast corners, resulting in tunnel vision. However, due to the high speed of the cars, rallying was more popular among spectators than ever. FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen's accident. John Davenport, author and former rally co-driver, stated in 2004 that [...] "Group B could have been tamed. They were only unsafe in so much as the fuel system, which caused Toivonen's death, and the crowd control needed changing– it wasn't the actual cars." [...] Group B cars have been described as [...] "too fast to race." ...|$|E

The <b>Eye</b> <b>could</b> fly and emit blasts of energy, {{and allowed the}} Empress to fly as well as survive in space. The Eye's residual energy also gave her, {{on at least one}} occasion, super-strength. It caused her to grow to gigantic stature during one battle.

2500|$|Historically in China a {{scoring system}} was used that penalized {{the player who}} had the {{greatest}} number of unconnected live groups of stones. On the basis that every group needs two eyes to be alive, and that the two <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> not be filled in, two points were deducted from the score for each live group {{at the end of the}} game. This was known as the [...] "cutting penalty" [...] in Chinese, and is sometimes referred to as the [...] "group tax" [...] in English. This rule is not applied in modern Chinese scoring.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of hip hop linguistics is complex. Source material include the spirituals of slaves {{arriving in the}} new world, Jamaican dub music, the laments of jazz and blues singers, patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes. Hip hop has a distinctive associated slang. It is also known by alternate names, such as [...] "Black English", or [...] "Ebonics". Academics suggest its development stems from {{a rejection of the}} racial hierarchy of language, which held [...] "White English" [...] as the superior form of educated speech. Due to hip hop's commercial success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across America and the world and even to non-hip hop fans. The word [...] for example is particularly prolific. There are also a number of words which predate hip hop, but are often associated with the culture, with homie being a notable example. Sometimes, terms like what the dilly, yo are popularized by a single song (in this case, [...] "Put Your Hands Where My <b>Eyes</b> <b>Could</b> See" [...] by Busta Rhymes) and are only used briefly. One particular example is the rule-based slang of Snoop Dogg and E-40, who add -izzle or -izz to the end or middle of words.|$|E
2500|$|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk {{was born}} (under the name Ali Rıza oğlu Mustafa) {{in the early}} months of 1881, either in the Ahmed Subaşı {{neighbourhood}} or at a house (preserved as a museum) in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in the Koca Kasım Pasha neighbourhood in Salonica (Selanik), Ottoman Empire (Thessaloniki in present-day Greece), to Ali Rıza Efendi, a militia officer, title-deed clerk and lumber trader, and Zübeyde Hanım. [...] Only one of Mustafa's siblings, a sister named Makbule (Atadan) survived childhood; she died in 1956. According to Andrew Mango, his family was Muslim, Turkish-speaking and precariously middle-class. His father Ali Rıza is thought to have been of Albanian origin by some authors; however, according to Falih Rıfkı Atay, Vamık D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, Müjgân Cunbur, Numan Kartal and Hasan İzzettin Dinamo, Ali Rıza's ancestors were Turks, ultimately descending from Söke in the Aydın Province of Anatolia. His mother Zübeyde is thought to have been of Turkish origin and according to Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, she was of Yörük ancestry. Due to the sizeable minority of Jews in Selanik during the Ottoman period, many of Atatürk's Islamist opponents have eagerly claimed that he may have had Dönmeh ancestors (Jews who converted to Islam during the Ottoman period). However, his grandparents were not native to Selanik, and his family had moved to this city (the largest metropolis in Ottoman Rumelia after Istanbul) in the late 19th century, from other provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Others have speculated that his light skin complexion, blond hair and blue <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> stem from Slavic ancestry.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an often}} misquoted passage from On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin appears to {{acknowledge}} the eye's development as a difficulty for his theory.

He notes that [...] "to suppose that the <b>eye</b> ... <b>could</b> have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree". Yet this observation was merely a rhetorical device for Darwin. He goes on to explain that if gradual evolution of the <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> be shown to be possible, [...] "the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> be formed by natural selection ... can hardly be considered real". He then proceeded to roughly map out a likely course for evolution using examples of gradually more complex eyes of various species.|$|R
