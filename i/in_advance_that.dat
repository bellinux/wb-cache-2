5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> <b>that</b> they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E

25|$|During the program, another psychic {{was doing}} a sorting of 250 Zener cards, {{guessing}} which of the five symbols was on each one.

25|$|There are two clear {{limitations}} {{to the classical}} definition. Firstly, it is applicable only to situations {{in which there is}} only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a coin until it rises heads, give rise to an infinite set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>that</b> all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 the {{government}} organised a national-level Christmas celebration but allegedly imposed an unofficial ban on all Christian religious symbols and hymns that specifically mention Jesus Christ.

Since that initial call to action, many <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> aerospace research have been applied to a wide variety of fields, including emergency response.

25|$|Many modern {{scientists}} have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define geography as {{the study of}} environmental influences is to assume <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>that</b> such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions. Furthermore, since evolutionary change manifests over very long time periods, some argue {{that the ability to}} adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst.|$|E

A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>that</b> their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.|$|E

Despite this, the team selected him anyway. Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround, and refused to trade Lindros, saying {{that the only way}} he would play in the NHL would be in a Nordiques uniform.

25|$|In the Story of Sanjan, {{it appears}} as if the Zoroastrians must have had some contact with Gujarat prior to their journey there, which has {{prompted}} suggestions that the Zoroastrians of the story were not in fact the first migrants. Whether these were also asylum seekers is unclear, but Iranian influence and emigrants are discernible in India long before the Parsis of the narrative arrive. The text states the migrants knew <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>that</b> Gujarat was governed by a monarch tolerant towards other (i.e. non-Hindu) religious beliefs, and {{this may have been}} determined through trade with the region (the city near Bushire - where the narrative's Zoroastrians are said to have lived for 15 years before setting sail - had extensive trading connections with the east).|$|E
25|$|No {{sooner had}} he {{published}} his theological lectures (the Theologia Summi Boni) than his adversaries {{picked up on}} his rationalistic interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Two pupils of Anselm of Laon, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the Theologia himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, {{but it seems to}} have been agreed <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>that</b> this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.|$|E
