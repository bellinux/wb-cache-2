5|$|Vermigli {{was ordained}} in 1525 and {{probably}} received his <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> around that time. The chapter-general of the Congregation elected {{him to the}} office of public preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in Brescia later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at Lent and Advent, the Augustinians preached year-round.

He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 by publishing his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island, which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy. During his life, {{he was known as}} a historian.|$|E

5|$|The {{faculty of}} the University of Florida awarded Sledd the university's first honorary degree, a <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity,</b> at the spring 1909 {{commencement}} ceremonies. In 1933, John J. Tigert, the university's third president, invited Professor Sledd to be the university's baccalaureate speaker. After his death, the university honored him again, renaming one of its early residence halls as Sledd Hall in 1939. The small state university, which Sledd had been instrumental in creating and organizing, {{is now one of}} the ten largest single-campus universities in the United States, with a total enrollment of nearly 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students.|$|E
5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|With their festal gowns, <b>Doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> wear a {{black velvet}} cap, and Doctors in other Faculties wear a wide-brimmed round velvet bonnet with gold string and tassels, {{known as a}} Tudor bonnet, instead of a mortarboard, though they may choose to wear a square cap with a festal gown if they are {{taking part in a}} {{ceremony}} in the Senate House.|$|R
50|$|The masters' gown is {{used for}} {{post-graduate}} masters courses and as the undress gown for doctors (the only exceptions being the MMus and undress DMus gowns - see 'Music degrees' below). <b>Doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> wear the masters' gown with a black silk scarf, while the junior doctors (PhDs and EdDs) are distinguished by a palatinate cord and button on the yoke.|$|R
5|$|Garrow had an {{irregular}} relationship with Sarah Dore, {{who had previously}} borne a son, William Arthur Dore Hill, by Arthur Hill, Viscount Fairford in 1778. Thomas Hague has suggested that Dore was an Irish noblewoman Garrow had seduced, but the only intent of his writings was to disparage Garrow, {{and there is no}} evidence to support his claim. Their first child, David William Garrow, was born on 15 April 1781, and their second, Eliza Sophia Garrow, was born on 18 June 1784. Garrow and Dore finally married on 17 March 1793. Dore was noted as particularly elegant, and was actively involved in local matters in Ramsgate, where the family lived. Dore died on 30 June 1808 after a long illness, and was buried at the Church of St Margaret, Darenth. David William Garrow was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, earning the degree of <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity,</b> and served as one of the Chaplains to the Prince of Wales.

He was appointed a Fellow of St John's College in 1869 and was President of the Oxford Union Society in 1871 (where he nominated H. H. Asquith to the Standing Committee). He was then ordained, and received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1874. Later, on 31 May 1895, he was awarded the degree of <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity,</b> having previously been excused by the University from satisfying the requirements normally set for the award of the degree.|$|E

50|$|Seton {{was present}} at the disputation with Peter Martyr held at Oxford in 1550. In 1553 he was {{installed}} canon of Winchester Cathedral, and in the following year prebendary of Ulskelf in the York Minster. He was one <b>of</b> the <b>doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>divinity</b> who, by the direction of Bishop Gardiner, went to Oxford for the disputation with Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer, concerning matters of religion, and on this occasion he was incorporated D.D. there on 14 April 1554.|$|R
60|$|At this, with {{a scream}} {{like that of}} a Hyrcanian tiger, Mulligan of the hundred battles sprang forward at his prey; but we were {{beforehand}} with him. Mr. Gregory, Mr. Grundsell, Sir Giles Bacon's large man, the young gentlemen, and myself, rushed simultaneously upon the tipsy chieftain, and confined him. The <b>doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>divinity</b> looked on with perfect indifference. That Mr. Perkins did not go off in a fit is a wonder. He was led away heaving and snorting frightfully.|$|R
25|$|The MA degree gives its holder a {{particular}} {{status in the}} universities' orders of precedence/seniority. In the University of Oxford a Master of Arts enjoys precedence, standing, and rank before all doctors, masters, and bachelors of the university who are not Masters of Arts, apart from <b>Doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> and <b>Doctors</b> <b>of</b> Civil Law. However, members of the university with undergraduate master's degrees automatically gain the precedence of a Master of Arts 21 terms after matriculation. Precedence, standing, and rank were formerly important for determining eligibility for appointments such as fellowships, but now generally have only a ceremonial significance.|$|R

60|$|Dr Fogram {{was true}} to his word, {{and made his}} {{appearance}} at the Long Vacation. The Carbonels, to whom little eager Sophia had been added {{a day or two}} previously, first saw him at Downhill Church, where he made a most dignified appearance, in a very full surplice, with his <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divinity's</b> red hood over it. The clerk, small, grey-haired, and consequential, bustled up to open the pulpit door for him, and he preached, in a fine, sonorous voice, a very learned sermon, that might have been meant for his undergraduates at Oxford.|$|R
6000|$|With <b>doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>divinity</b> the {{question}} is not so vexing or vexed; but it is said that of late a lion is rising in the way <b>of</b> rightly addressing <b>doctors</b> <b>of</b> medicine. If you wish to be attended by a physician who pays all visits after nightfall in evening dress, it is said that you are now to write Smythe Johnes, M.D., Esq., and not Dr. Smythe Johnes, as formerly. In England, the source of all our ceremonial woes, you cannot call a surgeon [...] "doctor" [...] without offence; he is Mr. Smythe Johnes when spoken to, but whether he is Mr. Smythe Johnes through the post, Heaven knows.|$|R
