40|$|The diagnosticity of <b>feelings</b> in {{judgment}} depends {{not only on}} their representativeness and relevance, but also on people’s trust in their <b>feelings</b> in general. Trust in <b>feelings</b> {{is the degree to}} which individuals believe that their <b>feelings</b> generally point toward the “right” direction {{in judgment}}s and decisions. Six studies show that a higher trust in <b>feelings</b> (a) increases the reliance on <b>feelings</b> as a judgment criterion, (b) amplifies the influence of ad-induced <b>feelings</b> in persuasion, (c) magnifies the ratio bias in risky choice, and (d) increases the rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game. Further, (e) when <b>feelings</b> are highly relevant, they are relied upon regardless of the level of trust, whereas when <b>feelings</b> have low relevance, they are relied upon only if people trust them. Finally, (f) assessments of trust in <b>feelings</b> require significant processing resources. A refined model of <b>feelings</b> as information is advanced based on these findings...|$|R
40|$|While {{many people}} procrastinate，the {{subsequent}} <b>feelings</b> experienced can vary considerably; some experience negative <b>feelings</b> {{while others have}} positive <b>feelings.</b> In order to explore the factors underlying the negative <b>feelings</b> associated with procrastination，this study examines the relationship between such <b>feelings</b> and personality. Japanese university students were administered with a questionnaire, including a number of subscales (self-preoccupation, external-preoccupation，optimism, pessimism, and their own procrastination behavior). The results indicate no significant effects of personality on such negative <b>feelings,</b> and that poor performance on at ask due to procrastination increases negative <b>feelings.</b> Moreover，external-preoccupation increases positive <b>feelings</b> that occur after procrastination. These findings imply that many Japanese students want to know ways of reducing the negative influences of procrastination and promoting its positive influences...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{significance}} of <b>feelings</b> in ethics. First, I will explain that the way of caring in terminal care enables us to accept patient's <b>feelings.</b> It is important for patients to express their own <b>feelings</b> to relieve pain, anger, grief and so on. Secondly, I will show that incidents such as ethnic conflict can not be solved simply by justice. Hatred and desire for revenge can not be removed by judgements or punishments. Such <b>feelings</b> have to be healed. Finally, I try to value <b>feelings</b> highly from a standpoint of virtue ethics. According to Aristotle, acting with opportune <b>feelings</b> is virtuous. Here the <b>feelings</b> are not opposed to reason, but rather reasonable. Everywhere in society, expressing <b>feelings</b> adequately is required...|$|R
40|$|Parental {{support and}} parental {{depressive}} <b>feelings</b> {{are found to}} be associated with depressive <b>feelings</b> in adolescent boys and girls, but results are inconsistent. In addition, the 5 -HTTLPR genotype has been found to interact with environmental stressors in predicting adolescents' depressive <b>feelings,</b> but this has not been examined longitudinally. Therefore, the present study examined the relationships between parental support, parental depressive <b>feelings,</b> and adolescent depressive <b>feelings.</b> In addition, the relationships between the 5 -HTTLPR genotype and adolescent depressive <b>feelings</b> were explored, as well as gene-environment interactions. Adolescents (N = 306; Girls = 53. 3 %; M (age T 1) = 13. 4) filled out questionnaires at five annual waves and provided saliva samples for DNA. Latent growth curve modelling (LGCM) was used to examine the baseline level and the change in depressive <b>feelings</b> over time. Maternal support was related to baseline levels of depressive <b>feelings</b> in girls, whereas paternal support was related to baseline levels in boys. Paternal depressive <b>feelings</b> were only related to boys' depressive <b>feelings</b> at baseline, and maternal depressive <b>feelings</b> were not related to any outcome measures. Furthermore, no associations were found between 5 -HTTLPR genotype and adolescent depressive <b>feelings,</b> and no gene-environment interactions emerged.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how men and women differ from having and expressing their angry <b>feelings,</b> controlling their angry <b>feelings</b> and to discover what are the differences in anger between age groups. A two-part questionnaire was used, where one part measures state anger and the other trait anger (more precisely, frequency of anger episodes). Participants (N= 466) at the age between 11 - 44 years rated their angry <b>feelings,</b> anger expression and anger control on a five-point Likert scale. As hypotesized, men have more angry <b>feelings</b> and angry expression. Women have higher control over angry <b>feelings.</b> Younger respondents had more angry <b>feelings.</b> Older people had better ability to control their angry <b>feelings.</b> These results are important because they demonstrate statistical relationship between angry <b>feelings,</b> gender and age groups...|$|R

40|$|Intuitively, how we {{feel about}} {{potential}} outcomes will determine our decisions. Indeed, {{one of the most}} influential theories in psychology, Prospect Theory, implicitly assumes that <b>feelings</b> govern choice. Surprisingly, however, we know very little about the rules by which <b>feelings</b> are transformed into decisions. Here, we characterize a computational model that uses <b>feelings</b> to predict choice. We reveal that this model predicts choice better than existing value-based models, showing a unique contribution of <b>feelings</b> to decisions, over and above value. Similar to Prospect Theory value function, <b>feelings</b> showed diminished sensitivity to outcomes as value increased. However, loss aversion in choice was explained by an asymmetry in how <b>feelings</b> about losses and gains were weighed when making a decision, not by an asymmetry in the <b>feelings</b> themselves. The results provide new insights into how <b>feelings</b> are utilized to reach a decision...|$|R

5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society.

He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His <b>feeling</b> of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E

40|$|It was {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{to examine the}} affective consequences of conformity to gender stereotypes, and to assess if <b>feelings</b> of social approval and authenticity mediate the relationship between conformity and affect. Therefore, we utilized an Electronic Momentary Assessment methodology to capture University of Maryland students’ engagement in gender stereotypical behavior, and their emotional and social experiences during their daily social interactions. Counter to expectations, we found that regardless of one’s own gender, enacting gender prescriptions enhanced <b>feelings</b> of authenticity and <b>feelings</b> of social approval, and enacting proscriptions reduced <b>feelings</b> of authenticity and <b>feelings</b> of social approval. Enacting prescriptions predicted more positive affect and enacting proscriptions predicted a more negative affective experience. <b>Feelings</b> of authenticity and <b>feelings</b> of social approval independently predicted <b>feelings</b> of more positive affect.

40|$|Although {{people have}} been shown to rely on <b>feelings</b> to make judgments, the {{conditions}} that moderate this reliance have not been systematically reviewed and conceptually integrated. This article addresses this gap by jointly reviewing moderators of the reliance on both subtle affective <b>feelings</b> and cognitive <b>feelings</b> of ease-of-retrieval. The review revealed that moderators of the reliance on affective and cognitive <b>feelings</b> are remarkably similar and can be grouped into five major categories: (a) the salience of the <b>feelings,</b> (b) the representativeness of the <b>feelings</b> for the target, (c) the relevance of the <b>feelings</b> to the judgment, (d) the evaluative malleability of the judgment, and (e) the level of processing intensity. Based on the reviewed evidence, it is concluded that the use of <b>feelings</b> as information is a frequent event and a generally sensible judgmental strategy rather than a constant source of error. Avenues for future research are discussed...|$|R
