25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin.

40|$|A {{gait cycle}} of 20 {{adolescents}} has been analyzed, representing {{each of them}} an age-gender group within a period of five years. The basic step values, the flexion-extension angle values between trunk and thighs (hips), thighs and calves (knees), calves and feet (ankles), and the angle between the horizontal and thighs were calculated.

Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher.

2500|$|The Book of Jonah, set in {{the days}} of the Assyrian empire, {{describes}} it (ff; [...] ) as an [...] "exceedingly great city of three days journey in breadth", whose population at that time is given as [...] "more than 120,000". But it is also possible that it took three days to cover all its neighborhoods by walking, which would match the size of ancient Nineveh. The ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamles and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrangle. The ruins of Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states He is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong ("who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand" [...] ) and mercy for the animals in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the [...] "relationship between mental {{retardation}} and the penological purposes {{served by the}} death penalty" [...] justifies a conclusion that executing the mentally retarded is {{cruel and unusual punishment}} that the Eighth Amendment should forbid. In other words, unless it can be shown that executing the mentally retarded promotes the goals of retribution and deterrence, doing so is nothing more than [...] "purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering", making the death penalty cruel and unusual in those cases. Being mentally retarded means that a person not only has substandard intellectual functioning but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction. These deficiencies typically manifest before the age of eighteen. Although they can know the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong, these deficiencies mean they have a lesser ability to learn from experience, engage in logical reasoning, and understand the reactions of others. This means that inflicting the death penalty on one mentally retarded individual is less likely to deter other mentally retarded individuals from committing crimes. As for retribution, society's interest in seeing that a criminal get his [...] "just desserts" [...] means that the death penalty must be confined to the [...] "most serious" [...] of murders, not simply the average murder. The goal of retribution is not served by imposing the death penalty on {{a group of people who}} have a significantly lesser capacity to understand why they are being executed.|$|E

2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Radiographic {{evaluation}} of mineralization stages of third molars {{is a valuable}} and important criterion for age estimation in legal medicine. The pattern of dental development is hereditary and differs from race to race. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was radiographic {{evaluation of}} developmental stages of third molars based on chronological age in Gilani children and young people. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive, analytical cross-sectional study, 400 panoramic radiographs from Gilani patients with an age range of 6 - 22 years were evaluated and developmental stages of third molars were recorded by Demirjian method. The mean age of the subjects in every developmental stage was determined. The correlation between age and developmental stage was analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. The <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left sides, and upper and lower jaws were analyzed by Wilcoxon test and sex differences were analyzed by Independent t-test (p value < 0. 05). Regression equations was obtained for age estimation (α = 0. 05). Results: The youngest age for observation of third molar bud was 6 and the oldest age was 11 in both jaws. There was a strong correlation between age and third molar developmental stage. There were no significant <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left sides, but there were significant <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> upper and lower jaws. Comparison between males and females revealed significant differences in only the C stage of left mandibular third molars and A and E stages of left maxillary third molars. Conclusion: Within limitations of the present study, radiographic evaluation of third molar development in Gilani children and adolescents might provide a reference for age estimation.
