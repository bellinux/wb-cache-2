5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Bill {{return to}} his {{university}} office, where he attempts to wipe Bill's memories of the day's events, but she stops him. He {{says that he has}} promises to keep, that he is in disguise and no-one should <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He changes his mind, however, and as Bill leaves the grounds she finds him waiting for her with the TARDIS. She agrees to travel with the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Hegel {{wanted to}} philosophize about Christianity {{but had no}} {{intention}} to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must {{come to terms with}} everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.|$|E
50|$|Mal soon {{returns to}} his Guardian identity, {{claiming}} that too many people <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
50|$|While Counter Force {{moves to}} a new hideout, Donyell stays behind now that Norman Osborn <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

25|$|René and Mélusine, now lovers, are in {{a richly}} {{decorated}} pavilion in the château Lusignan. They are surrounded by fairies, ondines, nymphs, gnomes and other mythical creatures who dance and sing for their entertainment. Suddenly the castle walls part and Stello de Nici appears. René demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> and Stello tells him that he is Mélusine's lover. René draws his sword, but Stello's powers make it fall apart in his hands. Stello then reveals Mélusine's trickery to René and tells him about her diabolic nature and pagan practices. René is overcome with remorse and vows to seek Blanche's forgiveness. He curses Mélusine as do a large chorus of demons whom Stello has summoned. As daylight breaks, Mélusine's face takes on a horrible expression and she is bathed in a lurid green light.|$|E
25|$|For {{that mission}} the Zamarons {{contacted}} Carol Ferris on Earth, and reveal {{to her that}} the Predator was on the planet. While searching for the violet emotional entity, Carol travels to Las Vegas where she locates the Predator, now inhabiting the body of a man who is infatuated with a woman who does not even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> and defeats it alongside Larfleeze and Hal who also had come searching for the love entity. The three then take the Predator back to Zamaron, however when Carol discovers the intentions of the Zamarons, she argues that the Guardians' technology that the Zamarons-based the battery on can be powered by the ambient love in the universe and refused to deliver the Predator. Upon hearing Carol's words, the Zamaron Queen Aga'po used the last of her life force to charge the Central Power Battery, leaving her title of Queen of the Star Sapphires to Carol.|$|E
500|$|The {{sick man}} begins {{to recover and}} Scully talks to him while the townspeople are gone. He {{does not seem to}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> or how he arrived. She {{inspects}} his wound again and finds a lump moving along the man's spine; digging into the open wound, she pulls out a piece of a large worm. Scully talks with the hitchhiker, whose name is revealed to be Hank, about the creature and thinks she cannot get it out without killing him.

60|$|The Rockpointers {{gazed at}} the white-haired man in astonishment. They wanted to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> but just then had other matters to attend to.|$|R
60|$|Margaret <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> {{and promised}} Sir Patrick {{to do all}} in her power for him, as truly his {{patience}} and forbearance well deserved.|$|R
500|$|Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, stating, [...] "he utilizes his vocal range here, including the teasing falsetto {{with which he}} gently instructs his partner to 'take this pillow right here/If you bite it, they won't hear.'

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} the pale, thin, long-nosed gentleman {{that used to}} sit in President Averill's pew at church. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> or where <b>he</b> came from. The college students used to call him Thaddeus of Warsaw. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> but the President, 'cause he could speak all the foreign tongues--one {{about as well as}} another; but the President he knew his story, and said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a good man, and he used to stay to the sacrament regular, I remember." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{he became}} acting President, despite having been Vice President {{for nearly three}} years, polls showed that the {{majority}} of the population did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R

I have a love-hate thing with publicity." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{both were}} near the gully Wilkinson stopped, and Charnock, whose head <b>was</b> bent, thought <b>he</b> had not <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>He</b> {{certainly}} looked surprised, and Charnock {{was conscious of}} rather grim amusement as he guessed the reason.

60|$|Thus dressed, he {{presented}} himself that evening before the Duke of Beloeil, and obtained leave {{to try and}} discover his daughters' secret. He looked so distinguished that hardly anyone would have <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
