Also, by iteratively applying local quadratic approximation to the likelihood (through the Fisher information), the least-squares method may be used to fit a generalized linear model.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch {{other than a}} jab is {{considered}} a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> will assume a right-handed boxer.|$|E

That proposition was made official by a treaty at Turin, dated December 1858. It was actually signed in January 1859.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries {{was not an}} isolated phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to greater or lesser degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate. Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.|$|E

Trainees also have to complete an advanced project, such as a research publication or paper. They also undergo an EMAC (Effective Management of Anaesthetic Crises) or EMST (Early Management of Severe Trauma) course. On completion of training, the trainees are awarded the Diploma of Fellowship and are entitled to use the qualification of FANZCA – Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.|$|E

25|$|After the {{independence}} of India in 1947, the area remained {{a part of the}} province of Assam. Nationalist activities arose amongst a section of the Nagas. Phizo-led Naga National Council and demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups. The movement led to a series of violent incidents, that damaged government and civil infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. The union government sent the Indian Army in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, an agreement was reached between Naga leaders and the Indian government, creating a single separate region of the Naga Hills. The Tuensang frontier was united with this single political region, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA), and it became a Union territory directly administered by the Central government with a large degree of autonomy. This was not satisfactory to the tribes, however, and agitation with violence increased across the state – including attacks on army and government institutions, banks, as well as non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, <b>following</b> <b>discussion</b> between Prime Minister Nehru and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a 16-point agreement was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognised the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged state within the Union of India.|$|E

500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] In very rough conditions, Pitman started the race at 11:43a.m., with both coxes {{initially}} steering their crews away from each other. [...] The Light Blues started better before Oxford passed them to lead after the first minute, their cox Henry Bensley-Wells opposite the Cambridge stroke Swann. [...] By the end of Fulham wall, the Dark Blues were clear of Cambridge but both crews had taken on board a large volume of water. [...] Bensley-Wells steered his boat close to the shore for shelter, moving out only to pass below the centre arch of Hammersmith Bridge before heading back towards the shore once again. [...] <b>Following</b> <b>discussion</b> with his stroke Robert Bourne, Bensley-Wells steered into the shore whereupon the crew disembarked to empty their vessel of the river water. [...] After getting back onto the river, the Oxford boat was approached by the umpire's launch and informed by Pitman that Cambridge had sunk off Harrods Furniture Depository and that he was declaring [...] "No Race". [...] Despite this, Oxford finished the course and paddled to Mortlake. [...] Prior to this year's event, there had been one sinking {{in the history of the}} race: [...] Cambridge sank in the 1859 race. Author Gordon Ross described the aborted race as [...] "a fiasco of some magnitude", while Drinkwater described it as [...] "the greatest fiasco in the history of the race."
