40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{oral health}} awareness, oral hygiene and attitudes towards general dental practitioners' (GDP) involvement in diabetes screening in adults with diabetes. Design Self-completion questionnaire. Setting <b>General</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> in Warwickshire. Subjects and methods Adults with diabetes attending clinics run by practice or diabetes nurses in <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices.</b> Results Two hundred and twenty-nine of 615 (37. 2 %) questionnaires were completed in 14 <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices.</b> The {{majority of respondents}} (79. 8 %, 178 / 223) visited a dentist {{once or twice a}} year, but oral care varied; 67. 2 % (133 / 198) reported brushing at least twice a day, whereas only 15. 3 % (29 / 190) flossed daily. Awareness of oral health risks was limited: 69. 1 % (150 / 217) had never received any oral health advice related to their diabetes. Over half of respondents supported the idea of dentists offering screening for diabetes (121 / 226, 53. 5 %). Conclusions Many adults with diabetes have poor awareness of oral care and health complications associated with diabetes, and are receiving limited advice from healthcare professionals. Training and advice for both healthcare professionals and patients concerning the importance of good oral health in patients with diabetes is needed. The role of dentists in diabetes screening and support requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Well-being at work is an {{important}} aspect of a workforce strategy. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and evaluate psychosocial factors and health and work-related outcomes of practices assistants depending on their employment status in <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices.</b> Methods: This observational study was based on a questionnaire survey to evaluate psychosocial aspects at work in <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices.</b> A standardized questionnaire was used, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ). Beside descriptive analyses linear regression analyses were performed for each health and work-related outcome scale of the COPSOQ. Results: 586 practice assistants out of 794 respondents (73. 8  %) from 234 <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> completed the questionnaire. Practice assistants reported the highest scores for the psychosocial factor ‘sense of community’ (mean[*]=[*] 85. 9) and the lower score for ‘influence at work’ (mean[*]=[*] 41. 2). Moreover, practice assistants who worked part-time rated their psychosocial factors at work and health-related outcomes more positively than full-time employees. Furthermore, the two scales of health related outcomes ‘burnout’ and ‘job satisfaction’ showed strong associations between different psychosocial factors and socio-demographic variables. Conclusions: Psychosocial factors at work influence well-being at work and could be strong risk factors for poor health and work-related outcomes. Effective management of these issues could have an impact on the retention and recruitment of health care staff...|$|R
