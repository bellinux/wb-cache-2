5|$|<b>Guinea</b> pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of <b>guinea</b> pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the <b>guinea</b> pig. Larger animals may regard <b>guinea</b> pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of <b>guinea</b> pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that <b>guinea</b> pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which <b>guinea</b> pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the <b>guinea</b> pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, <b>guinea</b> pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If <b>guinea</b> pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. <b>Guinea</b> pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for <b>guinea</b> pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. <b>Guinea</b> pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as <b>guinea</b> pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present.
