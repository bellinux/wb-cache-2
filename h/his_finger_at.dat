5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{was fined}} by the NFL {{after the game}} for US$5,000 for taunting: which {{consisted}} of wagging <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> All-Pro linebacker Brian Urlacher and doing a somersault after the 88-yard reception score. Bush apologized immediately after the event.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 2010, Foye {{was fined}} $10,000 by the Washington Wizards for {{participating}} in Gilbert Arenas' antics before a game on January 5, 2010 against the Philadelphia 76ers. Arenas was being investigated for a prior incident involving guns in the Wizards' locker room, but made light of the accusations by pointing <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> his teammates, {{as if he were}} shooting them. His teammates were photographed smiling and laughing with him.|$|E

25|$|On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin {{fired his}} prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, {{and for the}} fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed {{on the war in}} Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.|$|E
25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> him. To the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E

500|$|Trek's {{president}} John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, [...] "Greg's {{public comments}} hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand." [...] Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, [...] "As a contractual partner, he [...] could criticize doping only generally– not point <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> specific athletes, particularly one {{that happens to}} be the company's main cash cow." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker called Chris Owens {{portrayal}} of Spender [...] "gloriously stiff-necked". Lon Grahnke from The Chicago Sun-Times responded positively to the character, calling Spender [...] "devious". Shortly after {{the premiere of}} [...] "Terms of Endearment", Owens started to notice [...] "strange reactions" [...] from people on the street. He assumed their odd expressions were those of [...] "annoyance" [...] with his character because of his actions. One day, one particularly aggravated fan of the series actually shook <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Owens and called him a [...] "Paper shredder!".|$|E
500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E

500|$|The role {{of extra}} 9413 was played by Jules Raucourt, {{credited}} {{in the film}} simply as [...] "Raucourt". Although Raucourt started {{his career as a}} leading man of silent action films, he ironically became a film extra himself after cinema transitioned into the sound era. Raucourt later wrote a novel using the title of the film. The role of Extra #13 was played by Adriane Marsh, herself a film extra, who never again obtained a named role in cinema. Extra #15, who then becomes a movie star, was portrayed by Voya George, a personal friend of Vorkapić, who went on to a career in European films. Robert Florey also himself appears in the film as a casting director, although only his disembodied mouth and hand are visible, shaking <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the protagonist. Slavko Vorkapić also had a brief role in the film as the man constantly walking up the stairs toward the words [...] "SUCCESS".|$|E
500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E
500|$|As Southern Rhodesia {{had been}} the UK's {{legislative}} partner in forming the Federation in 1953, {{it would be impossible}} (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted.

[...] Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, which was held at Victoria Falls over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation {{at the end of the}} year. In the House of Commons afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had [...] "oiled the wheels" [...] of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was part}} of the {{evidence}} used by the FFA to help defend Harry Kewell's after-match argument with Merk, which (pending a FIFA enquiry) threatened his participation in Australia's following match against Croatia.

He restarted in 15th and never recovered. With 3 laps left while running in 8th place Ambrose tangled with road-course rival Max Papis, ending his hopes to win three races in a row at the Glen. Ambrose was visibly upset with Papis in the aftermath, furiously tossing his steering wheel at the in-car camera, tossing his helmet hard through his window, and pointing <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Papis when Papis came by under caution. Ambrose finished 31st. Had he won, Ambrose would have joined Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin as the only drivers in NASCAR history to win three consecutive races at the Glen.|$|E
2500|$|Mutombo also {{achieved}} {{a certain level}} of on-court notoriety. After a successful block, he was known for taunting his opponents by waving his index finger, like a parent reproaching a disobedient child. Later in his career NBA officials would respond to the gesture with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. To avoid the technical foul, Mutombo took to waving <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the crowd after a block, which is not considered taunting by rules. In addition, his flailing elbows were known for injuring several NBA players, including Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Patrick Ewing, Chauncey Billups, Ray Allen, Yao Ming, LeBron James and Tracy McGrady. His former teammate Yao Ming made a joke about it: [...] "I need to talk to Coach to have Dikembe held out of practice, because if he hits somebody in practice, it's our teammate.
