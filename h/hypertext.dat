40|$|In this paper, several {{problems}} in associating hyperlinks to {{text and the}} diverse possibilities {{to overcome these problems}} are discussed. At the current stage, an important aspect is knowledge retrieval of <b>hypertexts.</b> Our advanced studies on hyperlink management focus mainly on a concept similar to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems as a possibility for the automatic generation of links for <b>hypertexts</b> in addition to traditional textual based methods. A detailed discussion of the basic ideas of CBR and an evaluation of its usefulness follows. Finally, methods to evaluate the quality of the proposals are described. 1 Introduction The need for high quality <b>hypertexts</b> is increasing {{as a result of the}} growing of the World Wide Web (WWW).

40|$|Voluminous documentations {{could be}} more {{advantageously}} used if they were represented as <b>hypertexts</b> because they are usually not read sequentially but rather browsed for those text passages {{that contribute to the}} solution of a certain problem. But since those documents are available very often in linear form only, methods to convert linear documents into <b>hypertexts</b> automatically are desirable. The system HyperMan has been implemented to accomplish this task. But while it produces useful results, it makes sense to increase the quality of the constructed <b>hypertexts</b> by tapping the experience of the users. In this paper we propose to observe the users while they deal with the system and to evaluate automatically the user activities in order {{to improve the quality of}} <b>hypertexts.</b> The observation of users leads to the insight which paths users took while they searched for information.

This study aims to investigate learners’ reading preferences between <b>hypertexts</b> and printed texts, to identify the purposes of learners when selecting their preferred type of texts and to examine the problems when choosing both texts. The data from this study was obtained through questionnaire and interview. The findings showed that the respondents preferred <b>hypertexts</b> than printed texts. They believed <b>hypertexts</b> provide them comprehensive sources, space-saving and cost-saving. However, as for the printed texts they claimed that they faced problems when reading some of the texts that contained excessive words, undersize font size and missing pages.

50|$|The <b>hypertexts</b> {{available}} online enable readers {{to create their}} own reading paths and recontextualize the resources of websites. Through the recontextualization, the thematic regions and semiotic formations are more idiosyncratic than fixed. The readers play a role in picking up the meaning through the created reading paths. According to Harris, linguistic signs should be understood with non-verbal activities. In addition to reading the <b>hypertexts,</b> the readers have access to other non-textual resources online, such as pictures, diagrams, videos, etc. The use of those non-verbal semiotic resources within the texts has its function and offers affordances to the readers to make meaning.|$|R

We have to aid teachers in reorganizing knowledge to <b>hypertexts</b> that allows individual navigation. Supporting learners in finding their individual path is also a crucial factor. How to aid teachers and {{how to set up}} meaningful navigation aids will be discussed in four steps: 1.) Theoretical considerations; 2.) First step of Web-Didactics: Decontextualisation; 3.)
