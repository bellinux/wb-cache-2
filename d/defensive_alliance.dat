5|$|Béla {{set up a}} <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> {{against the}} Mongols. He married three of his daughters to princes whose {{countries}} were also threatened by the Mongols. Rostislav Mikhailovich, a pretender to the Principality of Halych, {{was the first to}} marry, in 1243, one of Béla's daughters, Anna. Béla supported his son-in-law to invade Halych in 1245, but Rostislav's opponent, Daniil Romanovich repulsed their attack.|$|E
5|$|He {{set up a}} <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> {{against the}} Mongols, which {{included}} Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, but it was lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later. During Béla's reign, a wide buffer zonewhich included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regionswas established along the southern frontier of Hungary in the 1250s.|$|E
5|$|In the north, the Royal Prussian nobles {{concluded}} a <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> with the Electorate of Brandenburg on 12 November in the Treaty of Rinsk, permitting Brandenburgian garrisons. Danzig (Gdansk), Thorn (Torun) and Elbing (Elblag) had not {{participated in the}} treaty, with Thorn and Elbing surrendering to Sweden. In the Treaty of Königsberg on 17 January 1656, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, took the Duchy of Prussia, formerly a Polish fief, as a fief from Charles X Gustav. The Brandenburgian garrisons in Royal Prussia were withdrawn, and when Marienburg (Malbork) surrendered in March, Danzig remained the only town not under Swedish control.|$|E
40|$|Secure {{sets and}} <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> in graphs are studied. They are sets of {{vertices}} that are safe in some senses. In this paper, we first present a fixed-parameter algorithm for finding a small secure set, whose running time is {{much faster than}} the previously known one.

40|$|We study a six-species Lotka-Volterra type {{system on}} {{different}} two-dimensional lattices when each species has two superior and two inferior partners. The invasion rates from predator sites to a randomly chosen neighboring prey's site {{depend on the}} predator-prey pair, whereby cyclic symmetries within the two three-species <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> are conserved. Monte Carlo simulations reveal an unexpected non-monotonous dependence of alliance survival on the difference of alliance-specific invasion rates. This behavior is qualitatively reproduced by a four-point mean-field approximation. The study addresses fundamental problems of stability for the competition of two <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> and thus has important implications in natural and social sciences.

5|$|Isolationist Paraguay {{was more}} {{difficult}} to win over. Brazil made the initial overtures, becoming the first country to formally recognise Paraguayan independence in 1844. This soon led {{to the establishment of}} excellent diplomatic relations. The Brazilian ambassador in Paraguay, Pimenta Bueno, became a private councilor to President Carlos Antonio López. A <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> was signed on 25 December 1850 between Brazil and Paraguay, in which López agreed to supply the Empire with horses for its army. But Paraguay refused to contribute troops to fight Rosas, believing that Justo José Urquiza (who had invaded Uruguay in 1839 and in 1845), the ruler of the Argentine Entre Rios province, secretly wished to annex Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|The Bond of Association, {{which the}} Privy Council gave out in October 1584, may have {{originated}} in Dudley's ideas. Circulated in the country, the document's subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as William the Silent {{had been a}} few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed. Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained {{the confidence of the}} King's favourite, Patrick, Master of Gray, in 1584–1585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the Treaty of Berwick, a <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot. Following the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Throckmorton Plot (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth's security after so many plots.|$|E
5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|In 1651, Cardinal Mazarin {{stayed in}} Cologne {{as a safe}} haven during the Fronde. During that time, he got to know Franz and William, {{and to see the}} {{influence}} they had in Cologne and other lands within the Empire. He began to cultivate them as supporters of French aims within the Empire, supporting their interest in developing Rhineland <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances.</b>|$|R
5|$|Brazil {{actively}} pursued ways {{to eliminate}} the threat from Rosas. In 1851, it allied with the Argentine breakaway provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios (led by Justo José de Urquiza), and the anti-Rosas Colorado party in Uruguay. Brazil next secured the south-western flank by signing <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> with Paraguay and Bolivia. Faced with an offensive alliance against his regime, Rosas declared war on Brazil.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{view of the}} Bronze Age {{of southeast}} Spain {{is one of a}} highly stratified society that some believe to be a state. The Albacete Survey Project used settlement pattern analysis on 267 Bronze Age sites in a 10, 000 km 2 survey area in eastern La Mancha (Spain) to test for the presence of social hierarchies. The results show a relatively egalitarian society at the begi 1 ming of stratification with indications of cluonic warfare. This paper uses the study of intervisibilities to test for the presence of warfare. The results show that in pat 1 s of the survey area, sites form clusters that can be interpreted as <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> of various sizes tlu???oughout the survey area, with empty areas between the alliances ("no-man' s-lands") defining their boundaries. The presence of these <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> of fortified sites indicates a society of competing polities with, at most, a two-tier hierarchy. A state would not have a segmented settlement pattern of groups engaged in warfare within its boundaries...|$|R
5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect also be made subservient to the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the political realities of the French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E

25|$|Vital to {{the signing}} of the treaty was the {{agreement}} made by Fath Ali Shah with Britain. With their defeat in the Russo-Persian War, the Shah understood that another attack by the Russians was close to inevitable. Britain saw the war as unwinnable for the Persians and used this to strengthen their foreign affairs. Using their new-found diplomatic connections with the British, Persia established the Treaty of <b>Defensive</b> <b>Alliance</b> in 1812. This promised that Britain would “offer a <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> against further Russian encroachments”. It essentially had terms stating that Persia would provide defense against any European army from entering India (which stationed a majority of British troops) and in return, Britain would provide military and financial aid in case of another Russian attack.|$|E
50|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{as to the}} impact of alliances. Several studies find that <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> deter conflict. One study {{questions}} these findings, showing that alliance commitments deterred conflict in the prenuclear era but has no statistically meaningful impact on war in the postnuclear era. Another study finds that while alliance commitments deter conflict between sides with a recent history of conflict, alliances tend to provoke conflicts between states without such a history.|$|R
40|$|Simple {{combinations}} of common competitive mechanisms can easily result in cyclic competitive dominance relationships between species. The topological features of such competitive networks allow for complex spatial coexistence patterns. We investigate selforganization and coexistence in a lattice model, describing the spatial population dynamics of competing bacterial strains. With increasing diffusion rate {{the community of}} the nine possible toxicity/resistance types undergoes two phase transitions. Below a critical level of diffusion, the system exhibits expanding domains of three different <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances,</b> each consisting of three cyclically dominant species. Due to the neutral relationship between these alliances and the finite system size effect, ultimately only one of them remains. At large diffusion rates the system admits three coexisting domains, each containing mutually neutral species. Because of the cyclical dominance between these domains, a long term stable coexistence of all species is ensured. In the third phase at intermediate diffusion the spatial structure becomes even more complicated with domains of mutually neutral species persisting along the borders of <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances.</b> The study reveals that cyclic competitive relationships may produce a large variety of complex coexistence patterns, exhibiting common features of natural ecosystems, like hierarchical organization, phase transitions and sudden, large-scale fluctuations...|$|R
25|$|During the Great Feudal War in the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Tver {{once again}} rose to {{prominence}} and concluded <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances</b> with Lithuania, Novgorod, Byzantium, and the Golden Horde. Grand Prince Boris of Tver sent {{one of his}} men, Afanasy Nikitin, to search for gold and diamonds as far as India. Nikitin’s travelogue, describing his journey from 1466 to 1472, is probably the first ever firsthand account of India by a European. A monument to Nikitin was opened on the Volga embankment in 1955.|$|R
25|$|In 1882 Italy {{signed a}} <b>defensive</b> <b>alliance</b> with Austria-Hungary and Germany (see Triple Alliance).

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{defensive}} weapons and their interaction with preemption. In a complete information setting, where attacks only occur as a consequence of predatory incentives, a unilateral acquisition of defensive weapons always destabilizes. Under strategic risk, where players might launch preemptive strikes, defensive weapons can help sustain peace. However, this only happens when such defensive systems are much more effective against a sneak attack than in an open war. Otherwise, defensive weapons are likely to also be destabilizing. We contrast these results with the effect of signing <b>defensive</b> <b>alliances,</b> which unambiguously bolsters the prospects of peace in both strategic settings...|$|R
