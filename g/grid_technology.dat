By combining both, we hope to leverage each other 2 ̆ 7 s strengths. In the paper, we first introduce our grid-enabled architecture which is based on both OGC and <b>grid</b> <b>technologies,</b> then we discuss how grid-enabled OGC Web services can be integrated with non-grid-enabled ones, and finally, we report our initial implementation of a case stud...|$|R
