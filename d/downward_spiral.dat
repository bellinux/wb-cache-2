5|$|Early {{ideas for}} The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral</b> were {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later {{used it as}} lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral.</b> This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Apple {{rejected}} {{a proposal for}} a Nine Inch Nails iPhone application, citing objectionable content in The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral.</b> Days later, Apple reversed the decision, but refused to explain its reasoning.|$|E
50|$|The DPM {{suggests}} that a singular disclosure event can affect both future disclosure likelihood and long-term psychological benefits. Approach-focused disclosure goals may maintain upward spirals toward greater visibility by gradually benefiting the disclosure, while avoidance-focused disclosure goals may initiate <b>downward</b> <b>spirals</b> toward greater concealment by gradually de-benefiting the disclosure. In upward spirals, individuals feel disclosing their identity more comfortably, greater support for their identity, viewing themselves more positively, and possessing a more unified sense of self. On the other hand, there are opposite effects on individuals who fall into the <b>downward</b> <b>spirals.</b>|$|R
50|$|More recently, ProSlide {{developed}} the SuperLOOP {{which features a}} fast, <b>downward</b> <b>spiralling</b> helix after a trapdoor release. The first installation was The Wedgie at WhiteWater World. It was marketed as a looping water slide despite riders never actually experiencing an inversion.|$|R
5000|$|Kilometre {{sections}} 50-55 of the expressway into Beijing {{has what}} the road sign labels as [...] "serial downgrades". It actually {{means that there}} are continuous curves heading <b>downward,</b> <b>spiralling</b> <b>downward.</b> If one speeds in this section, fatal accidents can occur -- and many have, racking up a horrendous death toll. Thus the nickname [...] "valley of death". It begins right after the first tunnel after the expressway splits at Badaling, entering Beijing.|$|R
5|$|Reznor has toured {{with some}} of his influences, {{including}} a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1989. In 1995 Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who along with Pink Floyd had been a significant influence on The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> of {{the economy}} has been {{attributed}} mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africaâ€™s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
50|$|Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a 1996 novel {{written by}} Rebecca Wells. It follows the novel Little Altars Everywhere. In 2005, Wells wrote Ya-Yas in Bloom and then The Crowning Glory of Calla Lily Ponder. Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood {{tells the story}} of the <b>downward</b> <b>spiraling</b> mother-daughter {{relationship}} of Vivian Walker and Siddalee Walker.|$|R
5000|$|Sideslip in {{the absence}} of rudder input causes {{incidence}} on the fuselage and empennage, thus creating a yawing moment counteracted only by the directional stiffness which would tend to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind in horizontal flight conditions. Under sideslip conditions at a given roll angle [...] will tend to point the nose into the sideslip direction even without rudder input, causing a <b>downward</b> <b>spiraling</b> flight.|$|R
60|$|A {{boundless}} cave of stalactites, it seemed; the cloud-born vapors <b>downward</b> <b>spiraling,</b> {{till they}} met the whirlpool-column from the sea; then, uniting, over the waters stalked, like ghosts of gods. Or midway sundered--down, sullen, sunk the watery half; and far up into heaven, was drawn the vapory. As, at death, we mortals part in twain; our earthy half still here abiding; but our spirits flying whence they came.|$|R
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that after their kiss, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) confirmed to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) her {{intention to marry}} Roy Anderson (David Denman). However, {{a few days before}} the wedding, Pam got cold feet and decided to call it off. She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes. Pam's rejection sent Roy into a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral,</b> hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest. When being interviewed by the camera crew, Roy makes a vow to win Pam back.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral,</b> follow-up The Fragile, and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E
5|$|Phillips, by now divorced, {{spent the}} {{following}} years on a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> which included, by her own account, spending $120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about {{a kid in a}} tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a simple model of rational agents competing {{in a single}} product market described by simple linear demand curve. Contrary to accepted economic theory, the agents' production levels synchronise {{in the absence of}} conscious collusion, leading to a <b>downward</b> <b>spiraling</b> of market total production until the monopoly price level is realised. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} standard predictions of an ideal rational competitive market. Some form of randomness in the form of agent irrationality, or non-synchronous updates is needed to break this emergent "collusion"...|$|R
50|$|Beside the <b>downward</b> {{economic}} <b>spiral,</b> bitter {{controversy in}} Baltimore and Philadelphia, about the local clubs continuing reliance on white umpires, {{may have been}} fatal to the league.|$|R
500|$|One {{year after}} The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spirals</b> release, the band {{released}} an accompanying remix album titled Further Down the Spiral. It features contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, J. G. Thirlwell, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. The album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews. Recoiled, a remix EP of [...] "Gave Up", [...] "Closer", [...] "The Downward Spiral", and [...] "Eraser" [...] by Coil, {{was released on}} February 24, 2014 via British record label Cold Spring.|$|R
5|$|She {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with troublesome Trey. He films them having sex, which is later leaked at the town's movie festival. She has a brief relationship with Liam. After the death of good friend Belle, Nicole goes on a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral.</b> She starts partying and binge drinking along with Indigo. Geoff notices her behaviour and attempts to help her. After pushing him away she sleeps with drug addict Liam. She then pursues older man Sid. She kisses him and Indigo sees them, which ruins their friendship. She later moves in with Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) who agrees to look after her.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral.</b> The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral</b> was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly {{identical to the original}} version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} article a model for memory {{retrieval}} of per-sonal experiences for virtual agents is presented. It builds upon previ-ous work and focuses on the effect memory retrieval can have on the agentâ€™s emotional state. Memory retrieval is defined as an emotional re-appraisal of past experiences. The variation of intensity of such re-experience is explored by modeling two phenomena: downward spi-rals and habituation. <b>Downward</b> <b>spirals</b> consist of situations in which recurrent retrieval of negatively charged past memories increases the recall intensity of such memories in depressed individuals. Habitu-ation is the reduction of recall intensity caused by re-experiencing past experiences in a context perceived by the individual as safe. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose {{definitions}} of funding liquidity and funding liquidity risk and present a simple, yet intuitive, measure of funding liquidity risk {{based on data from}} open market operations. Our empirical analysis uses a unique data set of 135 main refinancing operation auctions conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and December 2007. We find that our proxies for funding liquidity risk are typically stable and low, with occasional spikes, especially during the recent turmoil. We are also able to document <b>downward</b> <b>spirals</b> between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity.

40|$|We {{construct}} unique measures {{which allow}} {{to discuss the}} financial stability of banking systems with respect to funding liquidity risk. We quantify the maximal proportional price shock a banking system can sustain without <b>downward</b> <b>spiralling</b> illiquid asset prices. It follows that an absolute and a percentage increase of liquid assets improve and severer capital requirements in times of financial distress reduce banking system stability. The model is calibrated to the Austrian banking system. The empirical analysis shows financial instability already in 2006, i. e., the stability measure proves to have a long-term forecast power in this case.

5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of {{collecting}} license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|Before the Columbine High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The <b>Downward</b> <b>Spiral</b> {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E
5|$|Lumber mills, {{originally}} {{built to}} provide construction-grade materials for homes and business but then expanded to entice and then {{meet the demands}} of the railroad, profited from an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the NorthernPacific and CopperKing MarcusDaly, became the largest producer of lumber in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula's location as both a major lumber producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service created to help manage the nation's timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula's various lumber industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> of Missoula's lumber industry began with the closure of a plywood plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner's sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container pulp mill in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the <b>downward</b> {{economic}} <b>spiral</b> that ravaged the Zimbabwean Economy in {{the past}} 10 years and like most schools in Zimbabwe, St Bernard's lost professional staff to neighbouring countries. This has led to serious fall in educational standards.|$|R
25|$|The usual {{explanations}} include numerous factors, {{especially high}} consumer debt, ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors, {{and the lack}} of high-growth new industries, all interacting to create a <b>downward</b> economic <b>spiral</b> of reduced spending, falling confidence and lowered production.|$|R
40|$|IS field {{would develop}} more robust self esteem and {{identify}} were it to adopt dispositions that moved in virtuous circles rather than <b>downward</b> <b>spirals</b> (Grover at al. 2009). Prescriptions offered {{were that the}} field as a whole should celebrate our successes much more often, {{in view of the}} fact that the IS field has had a considerable number of these. We also suggested that group endeavors, like conference panels, workshops, and, in fact, authorial collaborations should focus on the positive, even in the event of criticizing the status quo. Finally, we tried to convince opinion leaders (as well as the rest of the community) that each of us has a stewardship responsibility to convey positive messages about the field. None of these prescriptions was intended to ignore realities, but simply to promote constructive actions rather than sheer negativity. I would like to continue this line of thought, but to confine my remarks to reviewing journal submissions such as those papers being reviewed at MISQ. Here, once again, we are confronted with a choice to engage in either virtuous circles or <b>downward</b> <b>spirals.</b> These take form in the metaphors of diamond mining or coal mining. Are We Seeking Out Diamond Lodes or Are We Rejecting Coal Lodes? When she was Editor-in-Chief, Carol Saunders spoke often and eloquently, both in print and in speaking venues about our reviewers seeing themselves as diamond cutters rather than as gatekeepers (Saunders 2005 a). Keeping with Carolâ€™s basic imagery, I depict the reviewing process as either diamond mining or coal mining, a change from her symbolism to account for the predispositions that reviewers have about the activity in which they are engaged...|$|R
5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> in operational capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral.</b> Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Paul's son, Robert, {{arrives in}} the guise of his twin, Cameron. Robert alienates Paul from everyone, before drugging and {{trapping}} him in an old mineshaft. Robert confesses to planting the bomb on the plane and sending a poisoned letter to Paul. Robert collapses the entrance to the mine and leaves Paul to die. Paul is eventually rescued and he is grows closer to Gail when she returns to town. Paul and Gail hold a fake wedding to lure Robert out of hiding and he shoots Paul, who survives due to a bullet proof vest. Paul goes on a <b>downward</b> <b>spiral</b> and flirts with several women, attempts to blackmail Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and betrays Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha). When Max accidentally kills Cameron, Paul decides to shoot Max in revenge, but he is talked out of it. Paul begins a relationship with Lyn and they become engaged. However, after kissing Rosetta Cammeniti (Natalie Saleeba) in the lead up to the wedding, Paul admits to Lyn that he cannot be faithful to her just minutes after they marry. Having sold half of Lassiter's, keeping a 49% share for himself, Paul decides to regain full control. Knowing Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) owns shares in Lassiter's, Paul tries to break up with relationship with Carmella and get him to date Elle.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{sales are}} forced sales of assets in which high-valuation bidders are sidelined, {{typically}} due to debt overhang problems afflicting many specialist bidders simultaneously. We overview {{theoretical and empirical}} research on asset fire sales, which shows how they can arise, how they can lead to asset under-valuations, how contracts and bankruptcy regimes adjust {{to the risk of}} fire sales, how fire sales can lead to <b>downward</b> <b>spirals</b> or cascades in asset prices, how arbitrage fails in the presence of fire sales, and how fire sales can reduce productive investment. We conclude by showing how asset fire sales shed light on several aspects of the recent financial crisis, and can account for the success of the liquidity provision and asset purchase policies of the Federal Reserve. ...|$|R
40|$|Disasters are an {{important}} public health issue with an excessive mortality, high survivor morbidity and functional limitations on daily living. According to the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), {{the total number of}} reported people killed between 1991 to 2005 were 960, 502 [1]. The total number of reported people affected by a disaster in the same time period was 3. 5 billion with economic costs totaling $ 1193 billion dollars [1]. The number of disasters around the world has increased by more than four times in the last 20 years [2]. Furthermore, the increasing disaster rate has disproportionately affected poorer nations and communities [2]. This has contributed significantly to the <b>downward</b> <b>spiraling</b> effect on the economic, political and public health conditions of several developing nations...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} four {{scenarios that}} can unfold when organizations either innovate or respond rigidly to organizational decline. Two of the scenarios are <b>downward</b> <b>spirals</b> that threaten an organization with possible death, {{and two of}} the scenarios are turnarounds. These scenarios are important because they can determine the fate of an organizationâ€”survival or death. We explore the conditions under which each of these scenarios is likely to emerge, developing original theory and specifying propositions about those conditions. In developing this theoretical framework, we distinguish between flexible and inflexible innovations as factors in turnaround success or failure. Our model extends current theory on organizational decline to highlight the feedback effects of the consequences of decline and to explain the circumstances in which particular feedback effects are likely to occur...|$|R
