25|$|In 2003, the {{government}} of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection (ECGC), a <b>domestic</b> <b>company</b> was also awarded with contracts. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when {{the government}} agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx {{for the treatment of}} one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than what the government had previously paid before for its municipal waste management.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{efficiency}} {{analysis of the}} 25 Taiwan-based life insurance companies during the period 2003 to 2006 by examining three different subgroups, namely, old <b>domestic</b> <b>companies,</b> new <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> and foreign companies. The primary goal {{of the present study}} is to compare two procedures widely used to evaluate the relative efficiency of the life insurance companies. First, we use the Metafrontier DEA method to estimate each group's technical efficiency, metatechnology and metatechnology ratio (MTR). Second, we apply Tobit regression to explore the factors that may influence the technology efficiency and the sources of differences. The results show that the technology efficiency of the old <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> is high both in terms of metatechnology and the MTR. This implies that the old <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> not only operate with the highest efficiency, but also approximate to the technological level of metatechnology. In addition, we also find that the metatechnology values of old <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> and foreign companies have greater significance than those of the new <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> and the MTR of the old <b>domestic</b> <b>companies</b> are more significant than those of the new <b>domestic</b> <b>companies.</b> To this end, improving the professionalism and service quality of operators and increasing the competitiveness and profitability of the life insurance companies are critical factors in increasing metatechnology and reducing the technological differences through professional licenses, service experiences, educational level and market share. life insurance companies, metafrontier data envelopment analysis, technical efficiency, metatechnology ratio...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical {{evidence on the}} relative performances of Foreign Controlled <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies</b> operating in the United Kingdom as compared to those of United Kingdom Controlled Domestic Dompanies. One hundred and fifty (150) Foreign Controlled <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies,</b> selected from the Times 1000 (1995), were matched with 150 United Kingdom <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies</b> on the bases of size and industry. The reported performance data of the two sub samples for five years were extracted from the FT Extel secured database. Statistical tests were then carried out, on five year average and annual bases, to establish whether there were differences in the performances {{of the two groups}} of firms. Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of Foreign Controlled <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies</b> and United Kingdom <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies</b> operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. Foreign controlled firms significantly under performed United Kingdom <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies</b> of comparable size and industry. The lower profitability figures reported by these firms were {{partly as a result of}} higher trading expenses. The study also found differences in the year to year magnitude of under performance by Foreign Controlled <b>Domestic</b> <b>Companies.</b> While findings in this study corroborate those of earlier United States based studies, the management and owners of Foreign Controlled Domestic Companies’ parents should be interested in the apparent underperformance of their United Kingdom based assets. It is possible, however, that the figures reported do not reflect real asset performance. In which case, the United Kingdom tax authorities may want to take a closer look at Foreign Controlled Domestic Ccompanies’ reported performances to establish whether they are the outcome of income shifting practices. Future studies could examine how the performances of the managers of these foreign located assets are evaluated and rewarded and explore other possible explanatory factors for their reported under performance...|$|R
