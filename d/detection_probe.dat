50|$|In the hybridization-ligation assay a {{template}} probe replaces the capture probe in the sandwich assay for immobilization to the solid support. The template probe is fully complementary to the oligonucleotide analyte and {{is intended to}} serve as a substrate for T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation. The template probe has in addition an additional stretch complementary to a ligation probe so that the ligation probe will ligate onto the 3'-end of the analyte. Albeit generic, the ligation probe is similar to a <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> in that it is labelled with, for example, digoxigenin for downstream signalling. Stringent, low/no salt wash will remove un-ligated products.|$|E

50|$|The DLA is {{intended}} to quantify the full-length, parent oligonucleotide compound only, with both intact 5' and 3' ends. DLA probes are ligated at the 5' and 3' ends of the analyte by the joint action of T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The kinase phosphorylates the 5'-end of the analyte and the ligase will join the capture probe to the analyte to the <b>detection</b> <b>probe.</b> The capture and detection probes in the DLA can thus be termed ligation probes. As for the hybridization-ligation assay, the DLA is specific for the parent compound because the efficiency of ligation over a bulge loop is low, and thus the DLA detects the full-length analyte with both intact 5' and 3'-ends. The DLA {{can also be used}} for the determination of individual metabolites in biological matrices.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} {{radioguided}} surgery, which was first developed some 60 years ago, {{involves the use}} of a radiation <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> system for the intraoperative detection of radionuclides. The use of gamma <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> technology in radioguided surgery has tremendously expanded and has evolved into what is now considered an established discipline within the practice of surgery, revolutionizing the surgical management of many malignancies, including breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer, as well as the surgical management of parathyroid disease. The impact of radioguided surgery on the surgical management of cancer patients includes providing vital and real-time information to the surgeon regarding the location and extent of disease, as well as regarding the assessment of surgical resection margins. Additionally, it has allowed the surgeon to minimize the surgical invasiveness of many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, while still maintaining maximum benefit to the cancer patient. In the current review, we have attempted to comprehensively evaluate the history, technical aspects, and clinical applications of radioguided surgery using gamma <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> technology. </p...|$|E

A microfluidic platform incorporating paramagnetic beads with immobilized capture probes {{is used for the}} biorecognition steps. The protocol involves simultaneous sandwich hybridization of a single-stranded nucleic acid target with the capture probe on the beads and with a <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> in the reaction solution, followed by enzyme labeling of the <b>detection</b> <b>probe,</b> enzymatic reaction, and finally, potentiometric measurement of the enzyme product at the chip surface.

The enzyme reaction product, p-aminophenol (pAP), is oxidized at the anode of the chip to quinoneimine that is reduced back to pAP at the cathode. The cycling oxidation and reduction of these compounds result in a current producing a characteristic signal that can be related to the concentration of the analyte. The performance of the different steps in the assay was characterized using in vitro synthesized RNA oligonucleotides and then the instrument was used for analysis of 16 S rRNA in Escherichia coli extract.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} phase 1 report {{summarizes the}} background and {{the work on the}} ''Increased Flexibility of Turbo-Compressors in Natural Gas Transmission through Direct Surge Control'' project to date. The importance of centrifugal compressors for natural gas transmission is discussed, and the causes of surge and the consequences of current surge control approaches are explained. Previous technology development, including findings from early GMRC research, previous surge detection work, and selected publications, are presented. The project is divided into three Phases to accomplish the project objectives of verifying near surge sensing, developing a prototype surge control system (sensor and controller), and testing/demonstrating the benefits of direct surge control. Specification for the direct surge control sensor and controller developed with guidance from the industry Oversight Committee is presented in detail. Results of CFD modeling conducted to aid in interpreting the laboratory test results are shown and explained. An analysis of the system dynamics identified the data sampling and handling requirements for direct surge control. A detailed design process for surge <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> has been developed and explained in this report and has been used to prepare drag probes for the laboratory compressor test and the first field test. The surge <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> prepared for testing have been bench tested and flow tested to determine and calibrate their sensitivity to flow forces as shown in data presented in this report. The surge <b>detection</b> drag <b>probes</b> have been shown to perform as expected and as required to detect approaching surge. Laboratory test results of surge detection in the SwRI centrifugal compressor demonstrated functionality of the surge <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> and a change in the impeller inlet flow pattern prior to surge. Although the recirculation cannot be detected because of the specific geometry of this compressor, there are changes that indicate the approach of surge that can be detected. Preparations for a field test had been completed {{at one point in the}} project. However, a failure of the surge probe wiring just inside the compressor case has caused a delay in the field testing. Repairs for the wiring in the compressor have been scheduled and the field test will take place shortly after the repairs...|$|R

40|$|Detection of somatic {{mutations}} in clinical cancer specimens is often hampered by excess wild-type DNA. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a simple and economical protocol without using fluorescent probes to detect low-level mutations. In this study, we combined peptide nucleic acid (PNA) -clamping PCR with asymmetric primers and a melting curve analysis using an unlabeled <b>detection</b> <b>probe.</b> PNA-clamping PCR, which suppressed amplification of the wild-type allele, was more sensitive for KRAS codon 12 mutation detection than nonclamping PCR in 5 different mutant cell lines. Three detection probes were tested (a perfectly matched antisense, a mismatched antisense, and a mismatched sense), and the mismatched sense <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> showed the highest sensitivity (0. 1 % mutant detection) under clamping conditions. With this probe, we were able to detect not only the perfectly matched KRAS mutation, but also 4 other mismatched mutations of KRAS.

Our data indicate that the combination of perfectly matched antisense PNA and a mismatched sense <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> can detect KRAS mutations with a high sensitivity in both cell lines and human tissues.

The sensors are based on species-specific capture and <b>detection</b> <b>probes,</b> which bind to the intergenic spacer region of rDNA (IGS). Oligonucleotide functionalized magnetic microbeads are used to capture the target DNA which is then detected using biotinylated <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> and a streptavidin-coupled label.

After amplification of the genomic DNA the sensors detected the presence of the fungi, in accordance with previous results obtained with PCR. No cross-reactivity between F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, or other fungi species tested, was observed.

A polymorphism of the AGT gene, consisting of two al-leles coding for methionine (M) or threonine (T) at position 235, {{has been associated with}} essential hyper-tension (1), diabetic nephropathy (2), and coronary heart disease (3). Cur-rently available but time-consuming methods for M/T 235 genotyping in-clude PCR amplification followed by denaturing gradient gel electro-phoresis, sequencing, minisequenc-ing (4), or restriction endonuclease digestion. Here we present a method based on the single-step LightCycler technology that uses a rapid PCR amplification followed by analysis of the melting behavior of fluorophore-labeled hybridization probes (5). In genotyping with two labeled probes, the shorter <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> covers the polymorphic site and melts off the template at a lower temperature than the longer anchor probe. In the presence of mutation, a mismatch between the <b>detection</b> <b>probe</b> and the amplified sequence lowers the melt-ing temperature of the <b>detection</b> <b>probe.</b> Genomic DNA from patients was extracted from blood according to standard procedures.

40|$|A four-electrode microconstant {{direct current}} {{resistance}} detector for ion chromatography not {{sensitive to the}} effects of electrode polarization, capacitance, and electrolysis by-products is proposed. A constant current of microampere magnitude is applied across the current electrodes of the four-electrode device, and the voltage responses between the <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> are directly picked up by a high input impedance instrumentation amplifier. The ion-exchange membranes, which separate the detection chamber from the electrolysis chambers, enable the measurement of solution resistance free of the interference of electrolysis by-products. Two resin beds in the detection chamber serve as ion conductors while reduce the dead volume of the detector. Recycled detection effluent supplies water for the electrolysis reactions at the current electrodes to sustain constant current in solution. The porous <b>detection</b> <b>probes</b> provide microchannel for the flowing solution while indicating signals. Owing to the constant current excitation, the electronics setup becomes simple.
