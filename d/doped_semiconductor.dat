40|$|When a fluid {{contains}} two diffusing components with different molecular diffusivities, such as heat and solute concentration, convective motion may be generated when potential energy is released owing to differential diffusion.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a thermoelectric generator depends on thethermoelectric {{figure of merit}} zT, where z is defined as z = α 2 σ/κ,(α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity). Good thermoelectric materials are typically heavily <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductors</b> with low thermal conductivity. Heavily <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductors</b> provide {{a balance between the}} large |α | of lightly <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and the high σ of metals.

What makes Zn 4 Sb 3 a remarkable thermoelectric material is the unusually low thermal conductivity (Fig. 1),comparable to that of a glass. The total thermal conductivity is the sum of the lattice thermal conductivity and the electronic thermal conductivity,where the latter can be estimated from the electrical conductivity using the Wiedemann–Franz law. The lattice thermal conductivity usually can be understood from the features of the crystal structure. Complex structure...|$|R

5000|$|The modern {{understanding}} of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a crystal lattice. [...] Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductor</b> contains mostly free holes it is called [...] "p-type", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as [...] "n-type". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the p-n junctions between these regions {{are responsible for the}} useful electronic behavior.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} {{many types of}} {{impurities}} will {{be present in the}} resultant <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> If an equal number of donors and acceptors are present in the semiconductor, the extra core electrons provided by the former will be used to satisfy the broken bonds due to the latter, so that doping produces no free carriers of either type. This phenomenon is known as compensation, and occurs at the p-n junction {{in the vast majority of}} semiconductor devices. Partial compensation, where donors outnumber acceptors or vice versa, allows device makers to repeatedly reverse (invert) the type of a given portion of the material by applying successively higher doses of dopants, so-called counterdoping. Most modern semiconductors are made by successive selective counterdoping steps to create the necessary P and N type areas.|$|E

40|$|Local {{potential}} changes {{arising from}} nanoscale three-dimensional spatial {{fluctuations in the}} dopant distribution in Zn-doped GaAs were investigated quantitatively by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at (110) cleavage surfaces. Tunneling spectra measured in areas with different local doping concentration show apparent shifts of the valence band edge and apparent changes of the band gap. A quantitative analysis, combined with band bending and tunnel current simulations, demonstrates that these effects arise from tip-induced band bending that modulates the real potential changes. It is illustrated how exact potential changes between locally high and low doped areas can be determined. It is found that the local potential fluctuations in three-dimensionally <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are approximately one order of magnitude smaller that those observed in two-dimensionally <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductors...</b>|$|R

50|$|Free carrier {{concentration}} is {{the concentration of}} free carriers in a <b>doped</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> It {{is similar to the}} {{carrier concentration}} in a metal and for the purposes of calculating currents or drift velocities can be used in the same way. Free carriers are electrons (or holes) which have been introduced directly into the conduction band (or valence band) by doping and are not promoted thermally. For this reason electrons (holes) will not act as double carriers by leaving behind holes (electrons) in the other band. In other words, charge carriers are particles/electrons that are free to move (carry the charge). They get charged at the battery/cell, and then flow throughout the circuit, giving energy to any components in the way, then when out of charge and {{towards the end of the}} circuit, they get re-charged by the battery/cell.|$|E
