500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E
500|$|The classic {{style is}} often used on {{prepared}} trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It {{is also the most}} usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot.</b> With the [...] "diagonal stride" [...] variant the poles are planted alternately {{on the opposite side of}} the forward-striding foot; with the [...] "kick-double-pole" [...] variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion. On uphill terrain, techniques include the [...] "side step" [...] for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the [...] "herringbone" [...] for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.|$|E
2500|$|Viewers {{are told}} that in the beginning, god (lower case [...] "g" [...] as {{explicitly}} stated in the narration) created death and {{not knowing what to}} do with it, kept it in a sealed urn. Toad was asked by god to watch the urn but Frog pestered Toad into giving it to him. Frog proceeded to juggle the jar from <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> and accidentally dropped it, [...] thus letting 'death' out, whereby everything from that point on had to die. As a symbolic reference to this story, George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine Horned Frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown during the opening narration.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{swearing}} of {{some sort}} of oath goes back to the earliest records of organised masonry, the first recorded ritual is not until 1696, in the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. From this, and from other documents of the same period, such as the Trinity College, Dublin manuscript of 1711, we can form an idea of the ritual of an operative lodge {{at the end of the}} 17th century. On taking of the oath of an Entered Apprentice a mason was entrusted with appropriate signs, a [...] "Mason's Word", and a catechism. This was accompanied by much horseplay, which was probably excised as the craft became more gentrified. The fellowcraft was made to take a further oath, and entrusted with two further words and the [...] "five points of fellowship", which in 1696 were <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> knee to knee, heart to heart, hand to hand, and ear to ear. The distinction between a fellowcraft and a master is unclear, and in many documents they appear to be synonymous. As accepted masons became initiated, where the various words and signs could no longer be regarded as professional qualifications, the entered apprentice ritual and the fellowcraft/master were sometimes condensed into one ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|The tie was the {{greatest}} of achievements for the underdog Commodores. The game's result was [...] "a great surprise to the sporting world." [...] It features prominently in the school's history. [...] "The Commodores surprising even to their followers, fought the Michigan eleven, headed by Coach Yost, to a standstill." [...] Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. Many publications called it [...] "one of the big moments of the gridiron season." [...] The Vanderbilt Alumnus wrote [...] "That 0 to 0 finish meant night shirt parades and a sleepless night of jollification. [...] And so it was." [...] Vanderbilt's yearbook The Commodore remarked, [...] "Whence came that irresistible spirit that shattered the Michigan plays no one knows. [...] Every man on the squad possessed it. [...] It was the re-enactment {{of more than one}} chapter in the record of Vanderbilt's past. [...] There never was a greater reversal in the history of athletics than that day. [...] The dwarf stood like a Titan <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> and breast to breast with the grim Michigan giant, and disarmed him." [...] It was said one Detroit reporter wrote [...] "Michigan was lucky to escape with their lives." [...] Sam S. Greene remarked, [...] "The defensive showing of Vanderbilt against the touted attack of the Western conference moleskin wearers was a revelation even to the ardent followers of the gold and black, who had expected a defeat by at least three touchdowns." [...] Captain Neely had tears of joy streaming down his face by game's end. [...] "They were lucky to tie us," [...] Neely later said of Michigan.|$|E

At the end of the 2008 season, Petco Park ranked 29th in hits and 30th out of 30 in home runs per Major League ballpark. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Padres announced that they were moving the fences in to make this ballpark more favorable to hitters than it had been previously. The left-center field wall was moved in from 402 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 390 <b>feet,</b> the right-center field wall was moved from 411 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 391 <b>feet,</b> and the right field wall was moved in from 360 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 349 <b>feet.</b> In addition, the visiting team bullpen was moved from foul territory in right field to behind the left-center field wall, right behind where the Padres bullpen is. The right field wall was also lowered from 11 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 8 <b>feet,</b> and the out-of-town scoreboard was relocated.|$|R
