5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty.

Tecumseh <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and ordered them to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order.

5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients.

He <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list.

5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements.

He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
