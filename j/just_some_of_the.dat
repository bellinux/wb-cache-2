5|$|The SaGa Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a display box for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from the SaGa series, with All Sounds of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already have most of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified for everyone who liked <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music of the SaGa series.|$|E

5|$|Skopje has {{a diverse}} nightlife. There {{is a large}} {{emphasis}} on casinos, {{many of which are}} associated with hotels, such as that of the Holiday Inn. Other casinos include Helios Metropol, Olympic, Bon Venon, and Sherry. Among young people the most popular destinations are bars, discos, and nightclubs which {{can be found in the}} center and the City Park. Among the most popular nightclubs are Midnight, Hard Rock, Maracana, B2, Havana and Colosseum where world-famous disc jockeys and idiosyncratic local performances are frequent. In 2010, the Colosseum club was named fifth on a list of the best clubs in Southeastern Europe. Armin van Buuren, Above and Beyond, The Shapeshifters are <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many musicians that have visited the club. Nighttime concerts in local, regional and global music are often held at the Philip II National Arena and Boris Trajkovski Sports Center. For middle-aged people, places for having fun are also the kafeanas where traditional Macedonian food is served and traditional Macedonian Music (Starogradska muzika) is played, but music from all the Balkans, particularly Serbian folk music is also popular. Apart from the traditional Macedonian restaurants, there are restaurants featuring international cuisines. Some of the most popular cafés in Skopje are Café Ei8ht, Café Trend, Drama Café, Lex Café and Blue Café. The Old Bazaar was a popular nightlife destination in the past. The national government has created a project to revive nightlife in the Old Bazaar. The closing time in shops, cafés and restaurants was extended due to the high attendances recorded. In the bazaar's restaurants, along with the traditional Macedonian wine and food, dishes of the Ottoman cuisine are also served.|$|E

25|$|Tourism is {{as a major}} {{industry}} of the region, owing much to the area's mild Mediterranean climate.

Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Legoland, the city's beaches, and golf tournaments hosted in the region such as the Farmers Insurance Open are <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major tourist destinations in the conurbation. Mexico's drinking age of 18 and legal and regulated prostitution make Tijuana a common weekend destination for many young Southern Californians and sex tourists.|$|E
25|$|When {{friction}} ridges {{come into}} contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as perspiration, oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited are <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics.|$|E

25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This was <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E
25|$|Corporations {{set their}} place of {{production}} usually in areas with little to no labor regulations, {{and as a result}} low labor cost occurs. With the low labor regulations, this is where you start to see mistreatment of workers especially with women and children. Poor working conditions and sexual harassment are <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mistreatment faced by women in the textile supply chain. Marina Prieto-Carrón shows in her research in Central America that women in sweatshops are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday. The reason it costs corporations more is because people can not work to their full potential in poor conditions, affecting the global marketplace. Furthermore, when corporations decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women, they are often left with no job nor assistance. This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the textile industry and agriculture industry, both which employ a higher amount of women than men. One solution to mistreatment of women in the supply chain is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the outsourcing of their product.|$|E
25|$|Ed's Bowling (formerly Red's), is an {{entertainment}} complex {{consisting of a}} bowling alley, arcade, and formerly a pool hall, music stage, and restaurant.

Wilco, Arcade Fire, The Flaming Lips, The Mars Volta, Motörhead, Matthew Good Band, Sloan, P.O.D., Joe Satriani, Cradle of Filth, Theory of a Deadman, Our Lady Peace, In Flames, Lifehouse, Children of Bodom, Bring Me the Horizon, Testament, DragonForce, Opeth, GWAR, Muse and Switchfoot are <b>just</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bands that have played at the venue. It was {{formerly known as the}} nightclub/restaurant/rec room Red's. At the end of June 2006, the owners of Red's closed its doors after they chose not to renew their lease. The mall separated it into three areas, converting the stage/restaurant area into a separate concert venue known as the Edmonton Event Centre, while the other area containing the lounge, the arcade and the bowling alley was re-dubbed Ed's Rec Room and a mini-golf course, Putt 'n' Glow. The Edmonton Event Centre closed on New Years Day 2013. It was demolished in December 2013, and Sport Chek took over its former space. In 2017, Ed's Rec Room renamed themselves to Ed's Bowling, so they would not get confused with the newly opened Rec Room, operated by Cineplex.|$|E
