40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> on national policy-making on European Union-level policy and European integration {{seems to be}} case specific and circumstantial. Certain <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> (for example, pension funds) are so influential {{that some of them}} become almost inseparable from the state. However, <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> are less likely to become influential when broad institutional questions are negotiated, rather than specific rules with a clear cost-benefit balance. And it is especially when they feel challenged by the state that they turn their efforts to EU-level lobbying. The record of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in EU policy-making appears also to be mixed. They are influential when they enjoy privileged institutionalised interactions with a policy-making node, such as European Parliament (EP) committees. However, access to the EP has recently become less privileged and institutional advocacy has become more contested, to the disadvantage of <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Many <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> actually obstruct the legislative process with seemingly inconsistent behaviour: they are in favour of European integration in general, but end up lobbying against concrete pieces of legislation if they are costly to them...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the most recent updates of classic {{integration}} theory tend to overstate the role of <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in European integration. Both "liberal intergovernmentalist" and "supranational governance" approaches see major <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> -either national or transnational-as the main explanatory factor of European integration in the first place. Our view challenges both strands of literature and argues that <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> are unable {{to act in a}} utility-maximizing way in a context of political uncertainty. European integration puts <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> under "stress;" their knowledge about the political system and their political strategies are flawed by the emergence of European levels of governance. In such a context, <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> will usually strengthen relations with national authorities. <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> must undergo learning processes to understand European policymaking, which is facilitated by the institutionalization of European levels of governance. Only once they have adapted, {{they will be able to}} return to utility-maximizing strategies of political representation.

40|$|Presence of {{organizations}} called <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in the European Economic Community {{was becoming more}} and more pronounced along with progress in integration processes. The author's attention is focussed on one of categories of groups and namely on <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> of socio-economic character set lip to pursue <b>interests</b> of <b>economic</b> subjects associated in organizational structures (e. g. agricultural producers, industrial producers, hired labour). Even a superficial analysis of the phenomenon confirms great potential importance of these groups for the integration process. Creation of the EEC and transfer of competences in the field of economic policy in favour of different institutions of the Common Market led to gigantic growth of interest revealed by national <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> <b>groups</b> wishing now to transfer their operations {{to the level of the}} EEC. This interest and a need for co-ordinatioh of activities of national groups paved the way for rapid creation of the groups at the EEC level. Analysis of genesis and process of creation of international <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> points at strong relationship between the integration process and creation of international structures replacing earlier national <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Stucture and internal organization of groups at the Common Market level is a function of tasks which are to be performed by these organisms on behalf of subjects grouped within them in relation to institutional superstructure of the European Economic Community.
