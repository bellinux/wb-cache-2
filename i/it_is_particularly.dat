5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E

5|$|The park is an {{important}} refuge for other wildlife, including woodpeckers, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, stag beetles and many other insects plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> notable for its rare beetles.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Mérens was {{introduced}} to the island of Réunion, where its breeding is now part of the local economy. It is used as a saddle horse and for hauling. The breed is also used for equestrian tourism on the mountains of the island, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> well suited for the steep terrain and climate, taking tourists into volcanic regions covered in ash.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E

5|$|Perl is dual {{licensed}} {{under both}} the Artistic License 1.0 and the GNU General Public License.

With only six reported exceptions, Perl can be compiled from source code on all POSIX-compliant, or otherwise-Unix-compatible platforms.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people with a history of illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> high if multiple contributing factors occur together. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the moor and {{prolonged}} peat extraction {{has provided a}} unique environment which provides a habitat {{for a range of}} flora and fauna. Much of the nature reserve managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust is based around abandoned peatworkings which have now become flooded. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> noted for the millions of starlings which congregate at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E

5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is intolerable from any state official. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> insidious from (a school principal) to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our constitution guarantees.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular crowding, which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
