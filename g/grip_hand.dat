40|$|In {{visually}} guided grasping, possible hand shapes are {{computed from}} the geometrical {{features of the}} object, while prior knowledge about the object and {{the goal of the}} action influence both the computation and the selection of the hand shape. We investigated the system dynamics of the human brain for the pantomiming of grasping with two aspects accentuated. One is object recognition, with the use of objects for daily use. The subjects mimed grasping movements appropriate for an object presented in a photograph either by precision or power grip. The other is the selection of <b>grip</b> <b>hand</b> shape. We manipulated the selection demands for the <b>grip</b> <b>hand</b> shape by having the subjects use the same or different grip type in the second presentation of the identical object. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that the increased selection demands enhance the interaction between the anterior intraparietal sulcus (AIP) and posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), and drive the converging causal influences from the AIP, pITG, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the ventral premotor area (PMv). These results suggest that the dorsal and ventral visual areas interact in the pantomiming of grasping, while the PMv integrates the neural information of different regions to select the hand posture. The present study proposes system dynamics in visually guided movement toward meaningful objects, but {{further research is needed to}} examine if the same dynamics is found also in real grasping...|$|E

I'm {{trying to find out}} whether the frequency of excercise changes through positive biosocial variables. Secondary goals of the research are monitoring the activity preferences and the level of health condition of the elderly.

Methods: In this thesis specialist publications were researched, content analysis of a survey was perfomed and a comparison of found results has been carried out. Results: The results for fulfilling the recommended excercise regimen by the active elderly population have been confirmed. The effect of some positive biosocial variables has been confirmed, albeit not all of them. We found out what excercise activities are preferred by our elderly and the test for their muscular strenght was performed to find that the elderly people, visiting fitness centers regularly are stronger than the rest of elderly population.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{hypertensive}} {{response to}} the infusion of epinephrine is exaggerated in subjects treated with noncardioselective,B-adrenergic antagonists, but not in subjects given cardioselective agents. In this study, we sought {{to determine whether the}} same holds true when hypertensive patients treated with these drugs are sub-jected to acute physiologic stress. According to a randomized crossover protocol, 13 hypertensive men received oral metoprolol and propranolol for 5 weeks each. The dosage was adjusted to maintain diastolic resting blood pressure at 80 - 90 mm Hg. Dunrng the last week of each treatment period, measurements were made of responses to a change in posture (lying to erect), isometric hand <b>grip,</b> <b>hand</b> immersion in cold water and pro-gressive incremental and steady-state exercise on a cycle ergometer. In addition to within-patient comparison of the two drugs, the responses were also compared with those in six healthy untreated controls. The increases in blood pressure associated with the pressor tests were similar during treatment with the two drugs. The heart rate increased less in controls and was similar in the two treatments. During incremental ex-ercise, ventilation was significantly lower during propranolol treatment than during metoprolol. This effect was not found during steady-state exercise, probably owing to a reduced rate of adaptation to exercise with propranolol. During steady-state exercise, cardiac output was similar with the two treatments. The extent of pressor responses to cold stimulus and to isometric and dynamic exercise were similar durin...|$|E
40|$|Semantic {{knowledge}} about objects entails both {{knowing how to}} grasp an object (grip-related knowledge) {{and what to do}} with an object (goal-related knowledge). Considerable evidence suggests a hierarchical organization in which specific hand-grips in action execution are most often selected to accomplish a remote action goal. The present study aimed to investigate whether a comparable hierarchical organization of semantic knowledge applies to the recognition of other’s object-directed actions as well. Correctness of either the <b>Grip</b> (<b>hand</b> grip applied to the object) or the Goal (end-location at which an object was directed) were manipulated independently in two experiments. In Experiment 1, subjects were required to attend selectively to either the correctness of the grip or the goal of the observed action. Subjects were faster when attending to the goal of the action and a strong interference of goal-violations was observed when subjects attended to the grip of the action. Importantly, observation of irrelevant goal- or grip-related violations interfered with making decisions about the correctness of the relevant dimension only when the relevant dimension was correct. In contrast, in Experiment 2, when subjects attended to an action-irrelevant stimulus dimension (i. e. orientation of the object), no interference of goal- or grip-related violations was found, ruling out the possibility that interference-effects result from perceptual differences between stimuli. These findings suggest that understanding the correctness of an action selectively recruits specialized, but interacting networks, processing the correctness of goal- and grip-specific information during action observation...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Cerebral Palsy (CP) {{children}} are the most clients referred to occupational therapy settings. Hand function is important in Activities of Daily living. There is a hand dysfunction in most cerebral palsy children. Orthosis and splints are commonly used to improve the position, range of motion, quality of movement and function of a person's arm or hand. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of static cock up c-bar splint on strength,spasticity, range of motion, and dominant hand function in spastic diplegic children with 8 to 12 years old.   Materials and Methods: This interventional study is in a before-after design. Thirteen spastic diplegic cerebral palsy children with 8 to 12 years old were selected through students who studied in physical disabled schools in Tehran city and had the inclusion criteria. Patients used a static cock up c-bar splint (wrist in 10 degrees of extension and thumb in palmar abduction and opposition) for two months, 2 hours daily and 4 - 6 hours at night. In this study the Jebsen Taylor test was used to evaluate hand function, the Modified Ashworth Scale was used to assess spasticity of thumb, wrist and elbow, ROM of thumb, wrist and elbow were tested with goniometer and power grip was evaluated with dynamometer.     Results : Results showed a significant improvement in hand function (p< 0. 001), in wrist`s spasticity (p< 0. 001), elbow`s spasticity(p< 0. 008), palmar abduction of thumb spasticity (p< 0. 002), wrist`s ROM (p< 0. 001), Palmar abduction of thumb ROM(p< 0. 001) and power grip(p< 0. 001). The data did not show significant improvement on elbow`s joint ROM.   Conclusion: Information from present research shows that using static cock up c-bar splint for 2 months, 2 hours a day and 4 to 6 hours nightly, can be an effective method to improve power <b>grip,</b> <b>hand</b> function, thumb, wrist and elbow spasticity and range of motion of thumb and wrist of spastic diplegic CP children...|$|E
