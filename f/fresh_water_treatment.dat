The growth parameter namely plant height and diameter of A. marina was significantly enhanced by salt with maximal stimulation at 2 % (equal to 75 % natural seawater) and this increase appeared to be attenuated by increasing the salinity concentration above 2 %.

Today the main challenge in world agriculture is to sustain the continuously growing global population, and this becomes more difficult due to climatic change, as this imposes further abiotic stress. The aim of this study was to find out the salinity effect on tomato production. The study was initiated at the Irrigation and Water Management (IWM) research field of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Bangladesh during October 2007 to April 2008 cropping season. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications. The treatments were: T 1 = Irrigation with fresh water, T 2 = Irrigation with saline water containing 4 dS m− 1 of Electrical conductivity (Seawater cannot hold as much dissolved oxygen as freshwater due to its high salinity. Conductivity and salinity have a strong correlation.), T 3 = Irrigation with saline water containing 6 dS m− 1 of Electrical conductivity, T 4 = Irrigation with saline water containing 8 dS m− 1 of Electrical conductivity and T 5 = Irrigation with saline water containing 10 dS m− 1 of Electrical conductivity. We found that the plants irrigated with the T 1 treatment (Irrigation with fresh water) was the highest fruit yield plant- 1 (1. 52 kg) whereas the lowest yield (0. 667 kg) was obtained from the higher level of saline water treatment T 5 (10 dS m− 1).

40|$|Sea-level {{rise and}} {{stronger}} hurricanes associated with {{global climate change}} will likely result in farther reaching storm surges that will greatly affect coastal ecosystems. These surges can transport nutrients, salt water, and sediment to nutrient poor, fresh (i. e. low salinity) pine savannas. Purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea) are pine savanna inhabitants that could potentially be at a disadvantage because their pitcher morphology and stout structure may leave them prone to collecting saline water and sediment after a surge. In this study, separate field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to test the effects of storm surge water salinity and sediment type on pine savanna soil characteristics, plant community structure, and pitcher plant vitality. In the field, plots (containing 2 ̆ 6 ge genet of S. purpurea) were experimentally storm surged with fresh or saline water crossed with one of four sediment types (local, foreign, fertilized foreign, or no sediment). Saline water inundation resulted in significantly higher pitcher plant mortality than the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> combinations. However, a subsequent prescribed fire and regional drought affected the study area during the next growing season, resulting in the decline of all the pitcher plants to zero or near zero percent cover. Soil data revealed {{that the combination of}} salt water and fertilized sediment resulted in short-term increases in soil-water conductivity and nitrogen availability. Interestingly, {{there were no significant differences}} in plant community structure between treatments, suggesting that the community as a whole is not as vulnerable as the pitcher plants to the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (i. e. storm surge, fire, and drought) operating in this system. Indicator species analysis revealed that some species were significant indicators of certain treatments; thus suggesting that pitcher plants are not the only species affected by storm surge. In the greenhouse, pitcher plants received various forms of sediment (i. e. no sediment, sterile sediment, or one of two levels of fertilized sediment) within their pitchers to determine if nutrient uptake is either inhibited or enhanced. Plants that received sterile sediment had higher carbon:nitrogen ratios and higher leaf mass per unit area. Eutrophic sediment deposition resulted in a temporary decrease in relative growth rate as well as changes in pitcher morphology. There were no differences in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rates between treatments. Both the field and greenhouse experiments indicate that global climate change may indirectly contribute to the further decline of southeastern purple pitcher plant populations in the future...|$|E

It enables one to simulate detailed (SAWPd) or simple (SWAPs) crop growth patterns in response to flow patterns in the root zone. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the ability of SWAPd to account for various salinity effects in grapevines under arid conditions, and to compare results from SWAPd and SWAPs growth models. A unique approach in our study was to use the same crop parameters for fresh and saline water while changing only the salinity of the irrigation water. We tested the effect of three salinity treatments (1. 8, 3. 3 and 4. 8 dS m¿ 1) on production parameters of grapevine. Vines in the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> benefited from the better water quality in that they used water more efficiently than in the other treatments. Three objective criteria were used to test the validity of the two models. These were standard error of model estimation (SEE), root mean square error (RMSE) and the index of agreement (IoA). With respect to the measured variables SEE (expressed as percent of the maximal value) was 5 % for 1. 8 dS m¿ 1 treatment and 11 % for 4. 8 dS m¿ 1 treatment. RMSE was 7 for 1. 8 dS m¿ 1 treatment and 15 % for 4. 8 dS m¿ 1 treatment. IoA was close to 1. It varied between a minimum of 0. 8 for SWAPs to a maximum 0. 99 for transpiration calculated by SWAPd for low salinity conditions, indicating acceptable agreements between the simulated and measured results. These simulated results were obtained when water quality was the only variable and hence they indicated the ability of SWAP's salinity models to generate realistic responses to salinity. In all calculations higher transpiration and LAI were simulated by SWAPd than by SWAPs. The deviations (SEE and RMSE) of SWAPs from the measured values were about 4 % larger than the deviations of the values simulated by SWAPd. It probably resulted from the more realistic detailed model, which contains many more growth parameters than SWAPs that requires only LAI. The higher simulated transpiration by SWAPd model affected the differences in the entire water regime. For example, SWAPs simulated higher water content than SWAPd because less water was extracted from its soil profile by transpiration. It was concluded {{that for the first time}} SWAPd (and to a certain level also SWAPs) was validated for grapevine under saline condition...|$|E
40|$|Depuis quelques années la {{pollution}} par les métaux lourds et devenue un problème important pour la protection de l'environnement et de nombreuses méthodes ont été développées pour éliminer les métaux toxiques présents dans l'eau. Parmi les différents procédés utilisés, la complexation-ultrafiltration est bien connue et de nombreuses études sur ce sujet sont décrites dans la littérature. Cependant, le choix de nouveaux macroligands hydrosolubles demeure important pour développer cette technologie. L'un des objectifs de ce travail était de montrer que dans ce procédé un biopolymère peut remplacer un macroligand de synthèse. Les expériences ont été menées avec de l'alginate de sodium, polysaccharide extrait des algues brunes, et porteur de groupements carboxyliques et hydroxydes capables de complexer les cations. Notre étude se divise {{en trois}} parties. Après avoir décrit, dans la première, le matériau et les méthodes utilisées, nous étudions dans la seconde les conditions de l'ultrafiltration (seuil de coupure, pression appliquée, pH, concentration), avant de discuter dans la troisième les résultats obtenus dans le traitement de solutions contenant Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Pb 2 +. For some years past, pollution by heavy metals {{has become one}} of the main problems for environmental protection. A number of methods have been developed to remove toxic metals from water. Among the various processes used, complexation-ultrafiltration is well known and numerous studies on this subject are described in the literature. However, the choice of new water-soluble macroligands remains important for developing this technology. One aim of the present work was to prove that biopolymers can replace synthetic macroligands in the process. The experiments have been conducted with sodium alginate, a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds and containing carboxylic and hydroxyl groups able to complex heavy cations. Filtration experiments were performed with a frontal system, equipped with a polysulfone membrane with a 20000 Daltons cut-off. The solutions studied were prepared by diluting in demineralized water either sodium alginate or "Titrisol Merck" for cations. Before filtration the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 20 min. The pH of the feed solutions was adjusted with HCl (or HNO 3 for Pb) or NaOH and determined accurately using a calibrated probe. The molecular weight of sodium alginate was determined by liquid chromatography and the viscosity was measured with either a viscosimeter for low values or a capillary method for concentrated solutions. Cation concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometryBoth permeate and retentate macroligands concentrations were estimated from measurements of total organic carbon (TOC). Following each experiment, chemical cleaning was performed by filtration of HCl, NaOH and water. This procedure was followed by demineralized water filtration, to ensure that the initial permeability was restored. In the first part of the work the ultrafiltration of sodium alginate solutions for different concentrations and various pressures was studied. Experimental results for macroligand retention, deduced from the TOC values, show a total rejection. All the curves, permeate flux versus time, present the same profile which indicates a significant concentration polarization. According to the obtained results we chose the value of 5 10 - 2 g L- 1 for the ligand concentration and one bar for the applied pressure. In the second part of the study, the retention of cations (Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Pb 2 +) was investigated. The observed results show that the removal rates are close to 100 %. These values depend both on the total concentration of cation and on the pH value. The retention of cations is shown to depend strongly on pH: a variation of pH between 3 and 5 leads to changes in retention efficiency from 0 to 100 %. This can be explained by the dissociation of alginic acid as a function of pH. For lower pH values the macroligand is in a molecular form and the metallic cation remains free; for higher values metal complexation is possible, increasing the rejection. If coordination number, rejection rate and pH are known, the various association constants can be determined using a graphical method. It can be seen from the results that the stability of the complexes formed decreases in the sequence Pb>Cu>Mn>Cd. In order to investigate the retention of these cations in a fresh water, the influence of calcium hardness was studied. The results indicate that cation removal decreases when the calcium concentration increases. This observation is an important restriction for <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> but does not affect the elimination of metals from a solution or an industrial waste containing cations...|$|E

40|$|Production {{wells in}} gas {{reservoirs}} often experience rapid production decline towards the late production stage. In many cases, this {{behavior can be}} attributed to salt precipitation in the near wellbore region. Water evaporates {{in the vicinity of the}} well bore with pressure drop, leading to an increase in the dissolved salt concentration, causing salt precipitation when the solubility limit is exceeded. Salt deposition causes the blockage of gas flow in the vicinity of the wellbore and increases towards the end of lifetime of a gas field, thus becoming problematic for most North Sea assets. Regular downhole <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatments</b> are required to restore the production back to normal. However, these <b>water</b> <b>treatments</b> are expensive and are required quite frequently. Thus, a better understanding of this phenomenon and the conditions under which it takes place is necessary. Additionally, the question arises whether there exists a better reservoir management strategy that can can improve control over well productivity. The model used to model salt precipitation in this work is a compositional two-phase N- component porous media flow model under isothermal conditions(2 pNcmin) developed in the numerical simulator DuMuX. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the sensitivity of the model to certain critical parameters and to understand the phenomenon better. The concept of a drying-transport balance was then developed, which can help understand the salt precipitation trends occurring under differing conditions. A study of the variables controlling the productivity of wells plagued by salt precipitation shows that there does exist an optimized reservoir management strategy which can better the cash flow from such wells. Based on these results, a simplified analytical model was developed to show the scope for optimization. Furthermore, an optimization problem was formulated to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of wells undergoing cyclic production and water washing.

In response, water works often apply large quantities of coagulants such as polyaluminium chloride (PACl). In this study, simulated and natural highly turbid water was coagulated with two PACls, a commercial product (PACl- 1) and a laboratory product (PACl-E). The Al species distributions of PACl- 1 and PACl-E under various pH conditions were determined, and the corresponding coagulation efficiency was evaluated. The PACl-E has {{a wider range of}} operational pH, while the efficiency of PACl- 1 peaks at around neutral pH. For simulated water up to 5000 NTU, the PACl-E was superior to PACl- 1 at low dosage and in the pH range studied. Similar results were discovered with natural water, except that when the turbidity was extremely high, the coagulation efficiency of PACl-E decreased significantly due to the presence of large amounts of organic matter. The coagulation of PACl-E was closely related to the content of polycationic aluminium (Al- 13) while that of PACl- 1 was dictated by the amount of Al, The sludge from PACl-E coagulation had better dewaterability when the optimum dosage was applied. The experimental results suggest that for natural water up to 5000 NTU, PACl containing high Al- 13 species is recommended for coagulation. In cases when the water contains high organic matter, efficient coagulation depends upon enmeshment by amorphous aluminium hydroxide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Production {{and growth}} of plants {{in many parts of}} the world due to {{degradation}} and water scarcity have been limited and particularly, in recent decades, agriculture is faced with stress. In the most parts of Iran, especially in the Khorasan Razavi province, drought is a fact and water is very important. Due to melon cultivation in this province, and the conditions of quality and quantity of water resources and water used to produce the melon product in this province, any research done on the use of saline and brackish waters is statistically significant. Materials and Methods: To study the effects of different water salinity and water management on some of the agronomic traits of late summer melon with drip irrigation, an experiment with 7 treatments and 3 repetitions was conducted in a randomized complete block design, in Torogh station, Mashhad. The irrigation treatments were: 1 - <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> from planting to harvesting, 2 - water (3 dS/m) from planting to harvesting, 3 - water (6 dS/m) from planting to harvesting, 4 - water (6 dS/m) from 20 days after plantation to harvesting, 5 -water (6 dS/m) from 40 days after plantation to harvesting, 6 -water (3 dS/m) from 20 days after plantation to harvesting, 7 -water (6 dS/m) from 40 days after plantation to harvesting. Row spacing and plant spacing were 3 m and 60 cm, respectively and the pipe type had 6 liters per hour per unit of meters in the drip irrigation system. Finally, the amount of salinity water, number of male and female flowers, number of seed germination, dry leaves' weight, leaf area, chlorophyll (with SPAD) etc. were measured and all data were analyzed by using MSTAT-C software and all averages of data, were compared by using the Duncan test. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of data showed the following: Number of seeds germination: Salinity in water irrigation had no significant effects on the number of seed germination. However, there was the most number of seed germinations in the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatments.</b> However, with increased water salinity, the time of seed germination reduced. The maximum delay in germination of seeds was in the treatment that was irrigated with <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> from the beginning of cultivation. Number of flowers: First, the male flowers appeared and after 5 to 7 days, the appearance of female flowers began. The effect of irrigation treatments on female flower appearance was significant. With increased water salinity, the number of male flowers decreased.

All treatments were able to reduce the soil salinity to the desired level at the end of the experiment; however, there were clear differences in the salt removal efficiencies among the treatments which were attributed to the presence of direct source of calcium ion. The soil amended with gypsum caused a substantial decline in soil salinity and drainage water’s electrical conductivity and drained the water twice as fast as the nonamended soil. It was found that utilizing agricultural drainage water and gypsum as a soil amendment for calcareous saline-sodic soil reclamation can beneficially contribute to sustainable agricultural management in the Jordan Valley...|$|R

40|$|The {{semi-arid}} climatology of Burkina Faso (Western Africa) {{is prone}} to extreme seasonal variations, chaining long periods of drought with heavy rainfalls concentrated between to the months of May and October. Deficiencies in both water supply and quality, especially in rural areas, comprise {{the main cause of}} illness derived from intestinal parasites, with particularly high incidences in the infantile population. This study is based in the rural area of the northern district of Yako, an area where one of every three families does not have access to potable water. It is centered on the <b>treatment</b> of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> by using the seeds of the plant moringa oleifera (introduced to the country by traders centuries ago) as a natural coagulant for the elimination of turbidity and suspended particles in <b>fresh</b> surface <b>waters.</b> This <b>treatment</b> is followed by chemical disinfection with chlorine generated in situ via electrolysis using an autonomous electrical power supply. A sustainable water purification system is thus proposed which can substitute the use of chemical reagents with natural products by employing a process which is both energy efficient and easy to operate...|$|R
