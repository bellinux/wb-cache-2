500|$|Chrysippus {{threw himself}} eagerly {{into the study}} of the Stoic system. His {{reputation}} for learning among his contemporaries was considerable. He was noted for intellectual audacity and self-confidence and his reliance on his own ability was shown, among other things, in the request he is supposed to have made to Cleanthes: [...] "Give me the principles, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> the proofs myself." [...] He succeeded Cleanthes as head of the Stoic school when Cleanthes died, in around 230 BC.|$|E
500|$|At {{the opening}} of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island [...] "whatever it takes". Speaking impromptu {{at the end of}} a {{prepared}} speech, the Sultan said in Malay: [...] "Let us be reminded that I do not forget Pulau Batu Puteh. Pulau Batu Puteh is not Singapore's, but it belongs to Johor. It does not matter how long it may take, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> the way to get back the island, which belongs to Johor." [...] The Menteri Besar of Johor said the state government had [...] "clearly heard" [...] what the Sultan said, but did not elaborate.|$|E
500|$|The common starling's {{gift for}} mimicry {{has long been}} recognised. In the medieval Welsh Mabinogion, Branwen tamed a common starling, [...] "taught it words", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, Bran and Manawydan, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole {{sentences}} in Latin and Greek, and in Henry IV, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare [...] "The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> him when he is asleep, and in his ear I'll holler 'Mortimer!' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer, {{and give it to}} him to keep his anger still in motion." ...|$|E

500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> her memory everywhere.|$|E

He, who knows everything, reassured her: [...] "Don't worry, dear sister, your husband is Bhola Shankara and promptly grants to his devotees whatever they ask of him, without regard for the consequences; for this reason, I think he has gotten himself into some trouble. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> out what has happened." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is about}} the lack of love in the world.
