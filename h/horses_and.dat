5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of methanogen compositions in the feces of <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony {{was carried out}} by constructing the α-subunit of methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) gene and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) clone libraries. The mcrA clone library analysis indicated that Methanomicrobiales was predominant in both <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony. Furthermore, most of the clones of the 16 S rRNA gene library showed that Methanomicrobiales was also predominant in <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony, but the LIBSHUFF analysis showed that the <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony libraries were significantly different (P< 0. 05). Most of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed low similarity to the identified methanogens in both the mcrA and the 16 S rRNA clone libraries. The results suggest that <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony harbor unidentified and novel methanogens in their hindgut. The methanogen population was higher in horse than in pony; however, the anaerobic fungal population was similar in <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pony. The methanogen diversity was different between two breeds of Equus caballus...|$|R

5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia.
