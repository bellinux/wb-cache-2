50|$|The Araneae are {{represented}} by 321 species, or 35% of Bulgaria's total. The spiders prefer the north-eastern slopes and are most diverse in the coniferous forests. There are 36 species of Myriapoda, or 20% of Bulgaria's total. They are distributed mainly in the forests and are less frequent in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zones. The Mollusca are 89 species and represent 27% of the nation's total (excluding the marine molluscs). Only 2% of Bulgaria's Ephemeroptera {{are found in the}} park — two species. The number of Orthopterida species is 63, or around 30% of the nation's total. The highest diversity is found in the valleys of the rivers Banderitsa and Damyanitsa. The Plecoptera {{are represented}} by 40 species, forming 40% of Bulgaria's diversity. There are 323 Heteroptera species, or 32% of the ones known in Bulgaria. They are most diverse in the northern parts of the park, in the Bayuvi Dupki - Dzhindzhiritsa Reserve. The Coleoptera are 639 species and this number it is estimated to raise to 1800-1900. The Neuropterida are 25 species, or 20% of Bulgaria's total diversity. There are 36 Hymenoptera species, found mainly at lower altitudes. The Trichoptera are 59 species, or 24% of Bulgaria's total. The Lepidoptera are 449, including 116 butterflies and 333 moths. Some of the most spectacular butterflies are the mountain Apollo (Parnassius apollo), clouded Apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne), <b>false</b> <b>Eros</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus eroides), mountain Alcon blue (Phengaris rebeli), large blue (Phengaris arion), scarce tortoiseshell (Nymphalis xanthomelas), Titania's fritillary (Boloria titania), eastern large heath (Coenonympha rhodopensis), Cynthia's fritillary (Euphydryas cynthia), etc.|$|E

Lysias is the earliest writer who {{is known to have}} composed erōtikoi; it is as representing both rhetoric and a <b>false</b> <b>erōs</b> that he is the object of attack in the Phaedrus. [...] Stylistic differences between the speech {{and the rest of the}} Phaedrus have also been taken to suggest that the speech was genuine.|$|R

Summary of topologies and clade {{supports}} {{result of}} the phylogenetic analyses of the combined molecular dataset {{as described in the}} Materials and methods section under (A) maximum-likelihood (ML), (B) parsimony and (C) Bayesian inference (BI). Families and genera are collapsed into cartoons depicted with different colors. Width of the cartoons reflects the actual number of terminals included in the analyses except for outgroups. The base topology is the ML result from the analyses of the complete dataset. Black asterisks denote bootstrap values ≥ 95 (in ML topology); posterior probabilities ≥ 0. 95 (in BI topology); clades supported across all parameters explored in the parsimony sensitivity analysis. Black squares represent values 95 > X ≥ 80 % (in ML topology) and posterior probabilities 0. 95 > X ≥ 0. 8 (in BI topology). Gelanor species are represented in red, <b>Ero</b> in <b>blue,</b> Anansi n. gen. in dark green, Australomimetus in brown; three clades of Mimetus that were recovered throughout the analyses are represented as follows: Mimetus from DR, Madagascar, USA and South Africa in turquoise; Neotropical Mimetus in purple and Indomalayan Mimetus in yellow. Tetragnathidae is depicted in light green; Arkyidae in pink and remaining outgroups in grey...|$|R
