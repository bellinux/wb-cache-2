40|$|Our {{research}} {{focuses on}} the evaluation of digital space and its prospective use as a functional space for future architectural planning tasks. Through the existence of digital technologies the authors consider that architects will have to expose themselves to new - planning tasks, which are not comparable to traditional architectural duties. This requires us to rethink architectural terms and their meaning in digital space. It demands us to extend the borders within which we think, work and design. The paper presents <b>exemplary</b> <b>projects</b> that demonstrate the applicability and added value of these mergers {{as an extension of}} solid architectural buildings. Focus is laid onto digital architecture that either extends its analog counterpart by providing functionality that does not exist in the “reali world or which doesn't have an analog counterpart at all. The paper aims at the definition of new tasks for architects to be developed. It describes methods and strategies architects have to be aware of to be capable to offer an extended field of activity. Finally it presents <b>exemplary</b> <b>projects</b> which show the possible added value clients could gain from buildings to be established as mergers of analog and digital spaces...|$|R

The {{following}} year the district Neuss was set up with the Bürgermeisterei Zons (an administrative level similar to an Amt) which comprised the municipalities of Zons, Nachtigall, St. Peter and Stürzelberg. In 1882 the district Neuss became part of the Regierungsbezirk Düsseldorf in the Rhine Province. Since about 1900 Zons has been a popular destination for pleasure trips. In 1904 the municipality Zons was granted its own coat of arms. Since then Zons was called again „Town”, {{despite the fact that it}} still belonged to the Prussian rural municipalities regarding administrative law. With the incorporation into the town limits of Dormagen with effect of 1 Januar 1975 [...] Zons called itself „Feste“ (Fortress).

The paper first shows that the project is not as participatory as international donors believe. Moreover, it illustrates that project's sustainability is at risk because inter-governmental political competition between the state and municipal government and party politics prevented the inclusion of the Municipality- institution responsible for maintenance- in project planning and implementation. If the project did not succeed at eliciting community participation- at least in so far as influence on project design and decision making- and is likely not to be sustained, what is this project successful at? And how do we explain that it became well known as exemplary? I argue that the Ribeira Azul project has been successful in the following three respects: (1) Deliverin...|$|E
40|$|Usability {{testing is}} a current method to value {{and improve the}} {{usability}} of a website or search portal. The described project sets usability testing in a library-related context. Using {{the example of the}} search portals LIVIVO and MEDPILOT by the special library ZB MED, it is investigated how the usability of a product is improved when results of usability testing are included in the process of the redesign of such a portal. In the project, a usability-study with user tests of LIVIVO is planned and carried out. The exposed usability problems are evaluated and first solutions are developed. Some of the test results are then compared to previous usability testing results of the former ZB MED search portal MEDPILOT, in order to find out how the usability has actually been improved by the redesign.
