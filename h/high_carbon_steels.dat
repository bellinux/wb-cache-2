50|$|Since {{producing}} <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> from {{wrought iron}} was very difficult, careful lamination of different alloys also served to conserve this difficult-to-make steel by using it {{only for the}} parts of the blades where it was needed. Many swords were made with the minimum possible amount of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> along the cutting edge, {{with the rest of the}} blade being made of low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> or wrought iron. A thin strip of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> could be laminated between two layers of softer steel, or a core of soft steel could be wrapped in <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> The Japanese katana was often found with complex patterns of soft and hard steels; having 5 sections of differing hardness welded together to form the final blade was not uncommon. The end result would be a blade with a very <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> edge (as much as 1.0%, equal to the <b>highest</b> <b>carbon</b> content found in low alloy steels in use today) and a softer spine. The very hard, but brittle, edge made the swords extremely sharp, while the spine gave the blade flexibility, so that it would bend rather than break.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of value of single draft on mechanical-technological properties of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires was evaluated. For wires drawn with medium single draft (10. 4 %, 15. 5 % and 26. 5 %) the investigation of mechanical-technological properties was performed thereby providing results on yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, contraction, number of twist and number of band. On the basis of numerical analysis of wire drawing process {{the influence of}} the value of single draft on inhomogeneity of strain was determined. It was established that in the range of medium single drafts 10 - 26 % used in drawing process of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires large single drafts cause the increase of their strength properties by deterioration of their plasticity properties. It was demonstrated that the increase of strength properties in wires drawn with larger single drafts is related to the occurrence of higher non-dilatational strain, which cause additional work hardening of material. The theoretical-experimental analysis of drawing of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires enabled evaluation of optimal value of single drafts by which it can be used relatively the most advantageous useful properties of wires.

40|$|Measurements of heat {{affected}} zone width for multi <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> joint in case of single and double pass arc welded have been studied. These measurements are carried out in accompanying of hardness and microstructural observations. Knowing that, <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> has a poor weld ability and most of welding processes are carried out for repairing components. It is found that a preheating {{was a very important}} parameter in identifying the width of heat-affected zone. Preheating the joint at 450 °C was found to gives less width {{heat affected}} zone (i. e. 5. 93 mm) in the case of single pass welding practices. While, in the case of double pass welding, the {{heat affected zone}} becomes wider because the excessive heating during welding cycle. The double pass welding has coarsening the structure of first pass.

40|$|Dual-phase <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> {{is widely}} used in mining and in {{chemical}} industry applications in highly abrasive environments due to its excellent hardness and abrasion resistance. In recent years, the use of less expensive but more corrosive solutions in industrial processes has become more common. As a result, detailed understanding of the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is needed; an issue that has, to date, been little-studied. This study investigates in detail the corrosion behaviour of dual-phase <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in a sodium chloride solution at different times, at the macro- and nano-scale, using various techniques. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3 D laser-scanning confocal microscopy, the corrosion behaviour of this important industrial steel was investigated at the micro-scale, then by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) it was further investigated at the nano-scale. The results reveal preferential corrosion attack on the retained austenitic phase, rather than the martensite phase, {{which is due to}} the carbon partitioning between martensite and austenite in this grade of steel...|$|R

This type of stainless steel may be slightly magnetic.|$|E
50|$|An alloy is {{a mixture}} of two or more {{elements}} in which the main component is a metal. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steel) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of silicon will produce cast irons, while the addition of chromium, nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels.|$|E
50|$|SAW filler {{material}} usually {{is a standard}} wire {{as well as other}} special forms. This wire normally has a thickness of 1.6 mm to 6 mm (1/16 in. to 1/4 in.). In certain circumstances, twisted wire can be used to give the arc an oscillating movement. This helps fuse the toe of the weld to the base metal.The electrode composition depends upon the material being welded. Alloying elements may be added in the electrodes. Electrodes are available to weld mild steels, <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> low and special alloy steels, stainless steel and some of the nonferrous of copper and nickel. Electrodes are generally copper coated to prevent rusting and to increase their electrical conductivity. Electrodes are available in straight lengths and coils. Their diameters may be 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.4 mm. The approximate value of currents to weld with 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 mm diameter electrodes are 150-350, 250-800 and 650-1350 Amps respectively.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} metal alloys is a {{significant}} part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron-carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.|$|E

Your piercer {{should be able to}} show you metal certs from the manufacturers they use and explain these details. For further info on safe materials for piercing, please visit safepiercing.org. Allergic reactions, when they occur, are rarely due to the stainless steel but from other factors (most commonly from mechanical irritation or harsh cleaning products). Allergic reactions typically include itching, redness, and swelling, with a discharge of clear fluid that is not lymph. The element in stainless steel that causes allergic reactions in some people is nickel. Polishing the jewelry to a mirror like luster results in a protective layer of chromium oxide which reduces the migration of the Nickel content into the tissue.|$|E
