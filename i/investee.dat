40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the institutional ownership and the cost of capital. Using firm-level data for the period from 1990 to 2006, we find that changes in dedicated (transient) ownership generally lower (increase) the <b>investee’s</b> cost of capital. Dividing the data into high- versus low-leverage <b>investees,</b> we find that highly levered <b>investees</b> benefit the most from an increase in dedicated ownership. Overall, the results suggest that ownership changes made by dedicated institutional investors can lower the <b>investee’s</b> cost of financing. We used different methods to check the robustness of our results. 2 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} a comprehensive overview of venture capital (VC) funds in Singapore. By examining {{the effects on}} their public listed <b>investees,</b> a profile of VC-backed listed companies in Singapore is analysed. It is found that value added of VCs to their <b>investees</b> can be attributed in several aspects: their equity stake taking, board seat, and especially in their timing of initial public offerings (IPOs) to market heights. The findings in the paper have several implications. Although the role of VC firms in Singapore is important in creating public companies, their participation {{with respect to their}} <b>investees</b> still lags behind their counterparts in the US. Their value added in management functions needs to be emphasized so that they can contribute more to the <b>investees</b> and thus, enhance their own returns. For companies seeking VC support or already preparing IPO with VC support, they should know what VCs can and cannot provide. For instance, they can expect the VCs to help in the timing of IPOs, but in management support, the help provided by the VCs in Singapore is limited compared to their US counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the financing problem of firms {{by applying the}} concept of agency theory to exploring the role of VCs in providing funds to entrepreneurs and firms and exploring the interactions between these two groups; i. e. VCs and VC backed firms with the particular focus on Thailand. The objectives of the research are to extend previous research on VCs {{in the context of}} an emerging economy, in this case Thailand, etc. Three research questions were formulated in response to what is believed to be a lack of emphasis on these issues in the literature, especially in regard to emerging economies, a). How do VCs and their <b>investees</b> in Thailand manage their agency problems?. b). What effect do these approaches to managing agency costs have on the relationships between VCs and their <b>investees?</b> c). Do VCs in Thailand practice value generation or value protection strategies? Do entrepreneurs benefit from the observed practices and in what other ways are <b>investees</b> affected? Eight propositions were formulated in order to address the research questions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|Equity {{accounting}} {{is usually}} applied where the entity holds 20-50% of voting stock, since this implies {{significant influence on}} {{the decisions of the}} associate by the holding company. Equity accounting may also be appropriate where the holding falls outside this range and may be inappropriate for some entities within this range depending {{on the nature of the}} actual relationship between the investor and <b>investee.</b> Control of the <b>investee,</b> usually through ownership of more than 50% of voting stock, results in recognition of a subsidiary, whose financial statements must be consolidated with the parent's. The ownership of less than 20% creates an investment position, carried at historic book or fair market value (if available for sale or held for trading) in the investor's balance sheet.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the value relevance of mandated disclosures by UK firms of the investor-firm share of liabilities of equity-accounted associate and joint venture <b>investees.</b> It does {{so for the}} six years following the introduction of FRS 9 : Associates and Joint Ventures, which forced {{a substantial increase in}} such disclosures by UK firms. Since the increased disclosure requirements were partly motivated by concern that single-line equity accounting concealed the level of group gearing, and in light of previous US results, it is predicted that the mandated investee-liability disclosures have a negative coefficient in a value-relevance regression. The study also examines whether value-relevance regression coefficients on investee-liability disclosures are more negative for joint ventures than for associates and whether they are more negative in the presence of investor-firm guarantees of investee-firm obligations than in the absence of such guarantees. The study reports that the coefficient on all investee-liability disclosures taken together has the predicted negative sign, and is significantly different from zero. It finds little evidence that the negative valuation impact of liability disclosures is stronger for joint venture <b>investees</b> overall than for associate <b>investees</b> overall, or stronger for guarantee cases overall than for non-guarantee cases overall. There is, however, some evidence that the impact for joint venture guarantee cases is stronger than that for joint venture non-guarantee cases and stronger than that for associate guarantee cases...|$|R

40|$|This article reveals new {{evidence}} on how venture capitalists evaluate high-tech enterprises. Questionnaires {{were sent to}} the UK's most active investors in the high-tech industry, focusing on their use of financial statements, risk reporting and information on internally developed intangible assets. Investors were asked to rate how useful they thought the standard financial accounts they received from potential high-tech <b>investees</b> were. By far the most common response was that standard financial accounts were fairly useless for gauging the value of possible projects. It seems that investors do not see compulsory reporting as a solution to information asymmetry. When asked which particular types of internally developed intangibles they would need valuation information on from the <b>investees,</b> all investors agreed that financial reports provided inadequate information about patents, copyrights and brands, and that they would ask specifically for this data...|$|R
