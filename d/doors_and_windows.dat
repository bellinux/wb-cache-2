5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> to the house were shut, except for {{the window in the}} main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows.</b> Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E

5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows,</b> in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Simpson {{family has}} barricaded all the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> {{except for the}} back door, which Homer forgot to do. Several zombies break into the house: Homer sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the zombies leave him when they realize {{he does not have}} enough brains for them to eat. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse the spell. The Simpsons arrive at the Springfield Elementary library and Bart casts the {{appropriate}} counter spell, causing all zombies to return to their graves.|$|E
5|$|Milsom street leads up hill, {{from the}} Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, {{which was founded}} in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital, to The Paragon which overlooks the Walcot area. The Paragon was {{designed}} by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> with central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments to the doorways. Numbers 22 to 37 continue the theme from numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|E

5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows.</b> The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of each wing have separate uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by inside corner walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows.</b> At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows,</b> under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E

5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows,</b> detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.|$|E
5|$|Sri Temasek was {{not used}} {{for a number of}} years and fell into disrepair. It then {{underwent}} restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on railings, <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century station {{building}} {{is owned by}} NS Stations. It is of the type SS 3rd class, which was designed by Karel Hendrik van Brederode. SS 3rd class was chosen instead of the smaller SS 4th class because {{of the importance of}} Winschoten as a commercial center. Eight buildings of SS 3rd class were completed in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1865, of which four remain today. This building of 1865 has a median risalit and wings on both sides parallel to the railway. The facade on the city side and railway side are identical, except for a half round decoration on the city side. The <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> of the building have arched frames. In the 1904 expansion, an enclosed porch was added and the east wing was extended with an extra waiting room.|$|E

5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> reflect the latter. A lightning rod extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E
5|$|Upon Alex's {{classification}} as {{a hurricane}} on January14, the Azores Meteorological Service issued a hurricane warning for {{the islands of}} Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Graciosa, and Terceira. They also issued a tropical storm warning for São Miguel and Santa Maria. A red alert—the highest stage for meteorological warnings—was declared for central and eastern islands. Homeowners protected <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> with plywood and sandbags in anticipation of damaging winds and flooding. Officials closed schools and administrative buildings {{for the duration of}} the hurricane on January15. SATA Air Açores cancelled 33domestic and international flights for the morning of January15, stranding more than 700passengers. The hurricane and tropical storm warnings were discontinued after Alex's passage on January15.|$|E
5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, one of {{the first}} priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less at risk of bombing. Its musical department, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The concerts continued through air raids, and audiences often stayed in the hall until early morning, with musical entertainments continuing after the concerts had finished. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7 September 1940. On 8 December <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> of the hall were blown out by blast. After temporary repairs, concerts were continued; after further damage on 6 April 1941 repairs were again quickly made, and the hall re-opened within days.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows</b> of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>windows,</b> while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
