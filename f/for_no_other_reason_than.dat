The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, if <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> tight specifications and consistency of parts, {{and many of these}} companies would have a chequered corporate history.

Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E
5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, if <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to a federal court following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> their race violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E
5|$|Oan, {{angered by}} the BBC's {{incorrect}} reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the latter was apparently released <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night.|$|E

However it was decided in October 1942, that the brigade would only have Indian or Gurkha battalions and the 151st was released and sent to the Middle East. The battalion was redesignated 156th Parachute Battalion <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> to confuse German intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the death of Claudius, Agrippina set upon removing those she had seen as a threat.

25|$|Some of {{the most}} savage attacks were perpetrated by a Protestant gang dubbed the Shankill Butchers, led by Lenny Murphy, who was {{described}} as a psychopath and a sadist.

Most of their victims had no connection to the Provisional Irish Republican Army or any other republican groups but were killed <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> their religious affiliation.

25|$|The {{sense of}} urgency for such reform stemmed from the {{intrusion}} of modernism. The cultural stream of interest and invention coming from the Christian Europeans caused many Muslims {{to search for a}} proper and adequate response. Merely to learn the foreign ways risked becoming alienated from one's own people and faith, yet modern science and technology, and perhaps government and social culture also, were becoming an ever-increasing challenge. The desire to reform appeared across the Muslim world, among the Ottomans and among the more remote Iranians and Mughals, as well as the Arabs. If <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> the performance of European armies and fleets, these modern ways were necessary to master. Devout Muslims realized that a proper place must be located in their tradition for this wealth of the new.|$|E
25|$|Briefly, Saxo's {{version of}} Hamlet's history is as follows: Gervendill, {{governor}} of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, {{on his return}} from a Viking expedition {{in which he had}} slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; she bore him a son, Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be an imbecile, but the suspicion of Feng put him to various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden (like Polonius in Shakespeare's play), in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage.|$|E

While {{the boundary between}} the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of {{what became known as the}} Berlin Wall, which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states. That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.|$|E

500|$|Both {{during his}} life and after it, Crowley has been widely {{described}} as a Satanist, usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship Satan, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as [...] "the Beast 666" [...] and referring to the Whore of Babylon in his work, while in later life he sent [...] "Antichristmas cards" [...] to his friends. In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as [...] "Our Lord God the Devil" [...] at one occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley [...] "was emphatically not" [...] a Satanist, [...] "if <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> simply {{because he did not}} identify himself as such". Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity [...] "as Socialists hate soap", an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice, largely because of a passage in Book 4 in which he stated that [...] "A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim" [...] and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to ejaculation, something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own [...] "ignorance and prejudice" [...] toward Crowley.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, if <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> <b>than</b> his persistence" [...] {{in the face of}} abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When {{was the last time you}} could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with."
