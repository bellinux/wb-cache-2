However, numbers <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> again since the 1930–40s as it reestablished in its former territory. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Robin Road Trestle is {{the only}} {{remaining}} intact trestle along the former line. In the early 2000s developers purchased the property {{on either side of}} the trestle's abutments, but the developers, the New York City Department of Transportation, and the New York City Transit Authority all claimed ownership of it. Consequently, townhouses <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> against both sides of it.|$|E
5|$|Passing through Cicuruk, the car {{breaks down}} and, while the chauffeur {{attempts}} to fix it, Kioe Lie takes shelter {{in a nearby}} home. He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he was wrong to be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.|$|E

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

For this reason, there are large numbers of people who support fox hunting and this can be for a variety of reasons.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, on-campus {{accommodation}} in {{the newer}} universities {{is a relatively}} new innovation. Since the mid-1990s, all Irish universities <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a stock of modern campus accommodation, although on-campus living is still the minority choice for students. Most accommodation is of apartment rather than halls of residence type and is managed by a University company, DCU Campus Residences.|$|E

A small number of the books have survived: a Bible; a volume of glossed Gospels; a work by Petrus Comestor, a French theologian; one by Hugh of Fouilloy, another French cleric; and a volume containing both the Sententiae of Isidore of Seville and De sapientia by Alcuin.|$|E
25|$|The Pali Text Society {{was founded}} in part to {{compensate}} for the very low level of funds allocated to Indology in late 19th-century England {{and the rest of the}} UK; incongruously, the citizens of the UK were not nearly so robust in Sanskrit and Prakrit language studies as Germany, Russia, and even Denmark. Even without the inspiration of colonial holdings such as the former British occupation of Sri Lanka and Burma, institutions such as the Danish Royal Library <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> major collections of Pali manuscripts, and major traditions of Pali studies.|$|E

25|$|Whatever his origins, Aurelian {{certainly}} must <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a {{very solid}} reputation for military competence during the tumultuous mid-decades of the century. To be sure, the exploits detailed in the Historia Augusta vita Divi Aureliani, while not always impossible, are {{not supported by}} any independent evidence and one at least is demonstrably an invention typical of that author. However, he was probably associated with Gallienus's cavalry army and shone as an officer of that corps d'élite because, when he finally emerged in a historically reliable context {{in the early part}} of the reign of Claudius II, he seems to have been its commander.|$|E
25|$|The sea and island zone of Quảng Ninh has {{a unique}} terrain. There are more than 2,000 islands, making up {{two thirds of the}} country's islands. They extend along the coast for more than 250km and divide into {{numerous}} layers. The largest islands are Cái Bầu and Bản Sen, while the smallest are just like rocks in a garden. Vân Đồn and Cô Tô are island districts. There are thousands of islands on Hạ Long Bay and Bái Tử Long Bay, many of which contain caves. Besides areas of alluvial deposits, there are also white sand zones which <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> from tidal action. Some places have formed white sand mines producing materials for the glass industry (Van Hai), or have developed into tourism spots (Trà Cổ, Quan Lạn, Minh Châu, Ngọc Vừng).|$|E
25|$|In a reactor {{that has}} been {{operating}} for some time, the radioactive fission products will <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> to steady state concentrations such that their rate of decay is equal to their rate of formation, so that their fractional total contribution to reactor heat (via beta decay) {{is the same as}} these radioisotopic fractional contributions to the energy of fission. Under these conditions, the 6.5% of fission which appears as delayed ionizing radiation (delayed gammas and betas from radioactive fission products) contributes to the steady-state reactor heat production under power. It is this output fraction which remains when the reactor is suddenly shut down (undergoes scram). For this reason, the reactor decay heat output begins at 6.5% of the full reactor steady state fission power, once the reactor is shut down. However, within hours, due to decay of these isotopes, the decay power output is far less. See decay heat for detail.|$|E
