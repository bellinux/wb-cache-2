5|$|The <b>gharial</b> is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In one story, a <b>gharial</b> and a monkey become friends when the monkey gives the <b>gharial</b> fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The <b>gharial</b> complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that. Similar stories exist in Native American legends, and in the African American folktale of an alligator and Br'er Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|There are two extant {{species of}} Gavialidae: the <b>gharial</b> and the false <b>gharial.</b> Gharials can be {{recognised}} {{by the long}} narrow snout, with an enlarged boss at the tip. They are rare and found only in South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the <b>gharial</b> and false <b>gharial</b> (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
50|$|Young <b>gharials</b> forage {{and hide}} in shallow water. With body size increasing, they forage in deeper water. <b>Gharials</b> up to 120 cm prefer 1 - 3 m deep water, those up to 180 cm hunt and hide in 2 - 3 m deep water. Adult <b>gharials</b> prefer water deeper than 4 m for {{foraging}} and hiding.|$|R
50|$|To give <b>Gharials</b> the {{rightful}} priority they deserve, this Film is an endeavour {{to ascertain the}} cause of deaths by carrying out field investigations, involving Indian and international experts, for the protection and conservation of <b>Gharials.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, several <b>gharials</b> {{were found}} dead in the Chambal River. Initially, it was {{suspected}} that fishermen had illegally caught fish using nets, in which <b>gharials</b> became trapped and subsequently drowned. Later post mortem pathological testing of tissue samples from the dead <b>gharials</b> revealed high levels of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, which together with stomach ulcers and protozoan parasites reported in most necropsies were thought to have caused their deaths.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, a {{pterosaur}} neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth {{embedded in}} it {{confirmed that the}} latter were not exclusively piscivorous. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts indicated that the biomechanics of Baryonyx were most {{similar to those of}} the <b>gharial</b> and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of Baryonyx and Spinosaurus similar in their resistance to bending and torsion. Baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with Spinosaurus and the <b>gharial.</b> The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that Baryonyx performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.|$|E
5|$|Miri Crocodile Farm cum Mini Zoo {{is located}} near the Baram Delta. It houses 1,000 estuarine {{crocodiles}} including Malayan <b>gharial</b> crocodiles. Man-made sanctuary pools are also constructed for the crocodiles. Other animals {{can also be found}} here such as cassowary, sun bears, python, monkeys and porcupines. Visitors are allowed to feed the animals with bananas available from the canteen.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also {{live in the}} southeastern United States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding on animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian <b>gharial</b> are specialised feeders, while others like the saltwater crocodile have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, care for their hatched young.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gharials</b> do {{not kill}} and eat humans. Jewellery {{found in their}} stomachs {{may have been the}} reason for the myth that <b>gharials</b> are man-eaters. Possible is that they {{swallowed}} this jewellery as gastroliths used to aid digestion or buoyancy management.|$|R
50|$|Champsosauridae is {{the best-known}} {{family of the}} Choristodera and typifies the group. Champsosaurus was first {{described}} from Late Cretaceous strata of Montana by Cope in 1876. Champsosaurs resembled modern <b>gharials</b> (gavials) or false <b>gharials.</b> The skull of these animals have a long, thin snout filled with small, sharp conical teeth. This is due to champsosaurs and <b>gharials</b> occupying similar niches: hunting small aquatic prey in rivers and swamps. This {{is a classic example}} of convergent evolution. More primitive choristoderes have shorter, broader snouts.|$|R

5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{was first}} classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American alligator shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are {{more closely related to}} the American alligator than to either the Nile crocodile or the <b>gharial.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>gharial</b> has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the <b>gharial</b> population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The <b>gharial</b> population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the <b>gharial,</b> and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E

5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male <b>gharial</b> may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern <b>gharial</b> and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E
25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile {{is one of}} the three crocodilians found in India, the other two being the more regionally widespread, smaller mugger crocodile and the narrow-snouted, fish-eating <b>gharial.</b> Apart from the eastern coast of India, the {{saltwater crocodile}} is extremely rare on the Indian subcontinent. A large population is present within the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary of Odisha and they are known to be present in smaller numbers throughout the Indian and Bangladeshi portions of the Sundarbans. The saltwater crocodile also persists in bordering Bangladesh as does the mugger and <b>gharial.</b> Populations are also present within the mangrove forests and other coastal areas of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Saltwater crocodiles were once present throughout most of the island of Sri Lanka, but remain mostly within protected areas such as Yala National Park, which also has a large population of mugger crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gharials</b> usually mate during December and January.During the {{dry season}} in March and April, females dig nests in a {{riverside}} sand or silt bank, 1 to 5 m away from the waterline. They dig 50 to 60 cm deep holes using their hind feet, and lay 20-95 eggs.The eggs are the largest of any crocodilian species and weigh an average of 160 g.After 71 to 93 days of incubation, young <b>gharials</b> hatch in July just {{before the onset of}} the rainy season. Their sex is most likely determined by temperature, like in other crocodilians too.Female <b>gharials</b> dig up the young in response to hatching chirps, but do not assist the hatchlings to reach the water. They guard the hatchlings for some time.|$|R
50|$|Most neochoristoderes have {{exceptionally}} large temporal fenestrae, suggesting powerful bite forces; Champsosaurus {{is estimated}} to have a bite force around 1194 to 1910 N, {{as opposed to the}} modern <b>gharial's</b> 310-497 N. In spite of this, most are thought to have had a diet similar to that of modern <b>gharials</b> due to the long and slender jaws, though Simoedosaurus has a more robust and shorter snout and could have fed on larger prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{average size}} of mature <b>gharials</b> is 3.5 to 4.5 m. The largest {{recorded}} length is 6.25 m, {{and the largest}} recorded weight is 977 kg. Hatchlings approximate 37 cm. Young <b>gharials</b> can reach a length of 1 m in 18 months. The average body weight ranges from 159 to 250 kg. Males commonly attain a total length of 3 to 5 m, while females are smaller and reach a body length of up to 2.7 to 3.75 m.|$|R
25|$|Some {{reptiles}} are predators too, {{including two}} species of crocodiles, the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), {{as well as the}} <b>gharial</b> (Gavialis gangeticus) and the water monitor lizards (Varanus salvator), all of which hunt on both land and water. Sharks and the Gangetic dolphins (Platanista gangetica) roam the waterways.|$|E
25|$|Eogavialis is an extinct genus of gavialoid crocodylian. It superficially resembles Tomistoma schlegelii, {{the extant}} false <b>gharial,</b> and {{consequently}} {{material from the}} genus was originally referred to Tomistoma.

50|$|<b>Gharials</b> have sacrificed {{the great}} {{mechanical}} {{strength of the}} robust skull and jaw that most crocodiles and alligators have, and consequently are unable to prey on larger creatures. The reduced weight and water resistance of their lighter skull and very narrow jaw enables <b>gharials</b> to catch rapidly moving fish, using a side-to-side snapping motion. At their peak, the Gavialoidea were numerous and diverse; they occupied much of Asia and America up until the Pliocene. One species, Rhamphosuchus crassidens of India, {{is believed to have}} grown to an enormous 8-11 m or more.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, a 10-year {{program for}} the {{conservation}} of freshwater turtles and tortoises was initiated by the bank in collaboration with government forest departments from concerned states across India. In May 2004, the bank successfully bred one of the world's most critically endangered turtles, the Indian painted roof turtle, Batagur kachuga, {{for the first time ever}} in captivity. The species is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and is listed under the Action Plan Rating I of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. The bank is home to another near endemic Batagur turtle, Batagur baska. Incidentally, recent evidence suggests that this species is extinct in the wild and only 13 individuals remain in captivity, including 4 adult females of which 2 are at the CrocBank. The bank sends 50% of its stock of the red-crowned roof turtle to the Uttar Pradesh forest department to introduce into the wild. In 2004, concerned parties created the <b>Gharial</b> Multi-Task Force (renamed to <b>Gharial</b> Conservation Alliance in 2008) to create a specialist organization dedicated to saving gharials from extinction.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the broader}} snout of fully grown S. imperator when {{compared}} to the living <b>gharial</b> and other narrow-snouted crocodiles, along with a lack of interlocking of the smooth and sturdy-crowned teeth when the jaws were closed, Sereno et al. hypothesized that S. imperator had a generalized diet {{similar to that of the}} Nile crocodile, which would have included large terrestrial prey such as the abundant dinosaurs that lived in the same region.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} its snout, Sarcosuchus {{presented}} an expansion, known as a bulla, which has been compared to the ghara seen in gharials. However, unlike the ghara, which is only found in male <b>gharial,</b> the bulla is present in all Sarcosuchus skulls that have been found so far, suggesting {{that it was not a}} sexually dimorphic trait. The purpose of this structure remains enigmatic. Opinions from researchers range from it being an olfactory enhancer to being connected to a vocalization device.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} of tomistomines among Crocodylia {{has been in}} flux; while traditionally thought to be within Crocodyloidea, molecular evidence indicates {{that they are more}} closely related to true <b>gharials</b> as members of Gavialoidea.|$|R
