40|$|Ground {{granulated}} {{blast furnace}} slag (GGBFS), a by-product of the steel manufacturing industry, being used as an effective partial cement replacement material, has already been proven to improve several performance characteristics of concrete. The reactivity of GGBFS {{has been found to}} depend on the properties of slag, which vary with the source of slag, type of raw material used, method and the rate of cooling. The present work aims at bringing out a novel relationship between the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Index</b> (HI) of slag at 7 and 28 days (H 17 and H 128) and the influencing properties of slag, namely, glass content, fineness and chemical composition by employing multiple regression analysis on 37 slag samples from various sources.

40|$|BioIndex {{testing of}} hydro-turbines is sought as an analog to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>index</b> testing {{conducted}} on hydro-turbines to optimize their power production efficiency. In BioIndex testing {{the goal is}} to identify those operations within the range identified by Index testing where the survival of fish passing through the turbine is maximized. BioIndex testing includes the immediate tailrace region as well as the turbine environment between a turbine's intake trashracks and the exit of its draft tube. The US Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy have been evaluating a variety of means, such as numerical and physical turbine models, to investigate the quality of flow through a hydro-turbine and other aspects of the turbine environment that determine its safety for fish. The goal is to use these tools to develop hypotheses identifying turbine operations and predictions of their biological performance that can be tested at prototype scales. Acceptance of hypotheses would be the means for validation of new operating rules for the turbine tested that would be in place when fish were passing through the turbines. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of numerical blade strike models as a tool to aid development of testable hypotheses for bioIndexing. Evaluation of the performance of numerical blade strike models is accomplished by comparing predictions of fish mortality resulting from strike by turbine runner blades with observations made using live test fish at mainstem Columbia River Dams and with other predictions of blade strike made using observations of beads passing through a 1 : 25 scale physical turbine model...|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of inlet momentum and inlet orientation on hydraulic performance of cylindrical water process tanks were investigated using a factorial design strategy. The hydraulic {{performance of the}} tanks was assessed with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, which calculated the flow fields and the residence time distribution (RTD). RTDs were used to quantify the tanks hydraulic performance using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indexes</b> that represent short-circuiting, mixing, and moment. These indexes were later associated with the effluent fraction of disinfectant (inlet and outlet disinfectant ratio). For small depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation and the inlet momentum {{were the most important}} factors regarding the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indexes</b> and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, respectively. A poor correlation was obtained between the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indexes</b> and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, indicating that they are not good predictors for water quality. For large depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation had the most significant effect on both the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indexes</b> and effluent fraction of disinfectant. The short-circuiting and mixing indexes presented a good correlation with water quality for this case.|$|R

40|$|Erosion of rock masses {{by water}} {{typically}} involves unraveling of blocks of rock along existing defects {{in a manner}} that is not represented by analytical solutions for sediment transport or rockfill (rip-rap). A pragmatic approach to this complex problem is found by using a rock mass index to represent the erodibility of the rock-mass. The likelihood of erosion is then assessed by comparison against case studies in similar rock masses. A new independent data set of rock-mass erosion was gained from inspection of 26 unlined spillways in Australia, South Africa, and the United States.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} distribution were examined under soil, crop and environmental factors. For soil factors, water retentivity <b>index,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>index</b> and response index were defined.

The simulation {{results showed that}} {{moisture distribution}} was large for 1) soil with small <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>index,</b> 2) the state of root distribution under favorable moisture condition, 3) small total root length per unit soil surface area, 4) l rge daily transpiration, and 5) small conductivity of the lower layers. Experiment on deep (distributed moisture condition) and shallow (homogeneous moisture condition) pots was conducted to study the relationship between soil moisture distribution and transpiration. To evaluate the distributed moisture condition the averaging methods by Taylor (1952), Gardner (1964), and Karamanos (1980) were used. Both the deep and shallow pot experiment showed that transpiration rate decreased with decreased in matri potential. Mean integrated potentials by the three methods were in good agreement with each other. The relationships between relative transpiration rate and mean integrated potentials of the deep pot experiment agreed fairly well {{with that of the}} shallow pot experiment.

40|$|The {{method of}} Annandale (1995) {{is widely used}} by Australian {{practitioners}} {{for the assessment of}} erosion in unlined spillways. This method is based on comparison to various case studies, where the geology at each site is characterised using the Kirsten index (a rock mass index previously developed to assess the rippability of rock), and the hydraulic conditions are characterised using the unit stream power dissipation. In this paper, the historical development of this comparative design technique is traced and is critically reviewed against the original geotechnical and hydraulic data, and against a new, independent, dataset gained from unlined spillways in fractured rock in Australia, South Africa and the USA. It is shown that, while erosion can be usefully correlated against rock-mass <b>indices</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indices,</b> this ‘comparative’ design technique has been promoted beyond its reach - the data do not support the inference of an erosion ‘threshold’ as presented by Annandale (1995).

40|$|The {{improvement}} of reactor performance is being continuously studied and discussed. One {{of the most}} common phenomena is short-circuiting of reactor analysis. It is very difficult to compare the degree of short-circuiting from <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indexes</b> in reality. Mixing {{is one of the key}} mechanisms; accordingly it is possible to apply mixing indexes to compare the level of short-circuiting. Identification of reactor type was essential and necessary; we supplied several differentiation criteria to identify the reactor type to make the comparison achievable. Therefore, this study was to develop a simple and practical method for short-circuiting comparison with the 'distance method' through eight available mixing indexes. The results showed that all the indexes could correctly be compared. The 'distance method' was the method, considering the nature and type of studied reactor, using the distance between the study reactor and the identified type of ideal reactor on the axis of the index, and taking these values to differentiate the reactors for the degree of short-circuiting. This method could be applied to reactors from a lab scale to the field scale. We hope this process could further help us to understand the reactors better and to make the comparison possible...|$|R

40|$|Sand-bed rivers {{differ from}} gravel-bed rivers in both {{hydraulic}} and sediment transport terms {{and they also}} differ in terms of channel pattern. Based on data from around 200 alluvial rivers in several countries, a systematic comparison of flow shear stress and stream power has been made between sand- and gravel-bed rivers. The formation of channel pattern {{can be regarded as}} the outcome of sediment transport and channel bank constraints In an alluvial river. To overcome the difficulty of quantifying channel bank constraints, channel width/ depth ratio and a dimensionless channel width index are used to reflect it indirectly. The sediment transport characteristics are expressed in terms of flow shear stress, stream power and the Shields stress tau* = dS/RD(50) or its simplified form of dS/D(50), where S is channel slope, d is water depth and D(50) is median size of bed sediment. By plotting the relationships between these <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indices</b> and the indices expressing batik constraint in a two-dimensional plane, meandering and braided channel can be divided by one line and sand- and gravel-bed channels by another.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has shown great {{potential}} as a powerful and cost-efficient tool to troubleshoot existing disinfection contactors and improve future designs for the water and wastewater treatment utilities. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation two CFD simulation methodologies or strategies for computing turbulent flow are evaluated in terms of the predicted hydraulic performance of contactors. In the LES (large eddy simulation) methodology, the more energetic, larger scales of the turbulence are explicitly computed or resolved by the grid. In the less computationally intensive RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) methodology, only the mean component of the flow is resolved and the effect of the unresolved turbulent scales is accounted for through a turbulence model. For baffled contactors, RANS performs on par with the LES in predicting <b>hydraulic</b> performance <b>indices.</b> In this type of contactors, hydraulic performance is primarily determined by quasi-steady recirculating (dead) zones within the contactor chambers which are well-resolved in both RANS and LES. Testing of the RANS methodology is also performed for a wastewater stabilization pond leading to prediction of <b>hydraulic</b> performance <b>indices</b> in good agreement with field measurements. However, for column contactors, LES performs better than RANS due to the ability of the LES to resolve unsteady or unstable flow structure associated with spatial transition to turbulence which is important in the determination of the hydraulic performance of the contactor. In the second part of this dissertation the RANS methodology is adapted in order to develop a novel modeling framework for ozone disinfection of drinking water. This framework is unique as it combines CFD with kinetics-based reaction modeling to predict disinfection performance and bromate formation for the first time. Bromate, a human health hazard, is an undesired by-product of the disinfection of drinking water via ozonation. The modeling framework is validated via application to a full-scale ozone contactor.

Experiments were performed for a range of the Froude number from 3 to 7. 5. Five shapes of corrugations (sinusoidal, triangular, trapezoidal with two side slopes and rectangular) of the same amplitude and wavelength were tested. Two values of relative roughness t/y 1 of 0. 36 and 0. 72 were studied. It was found that, for all shapes of corrugated beds, the tailwater depth required to form a jump was appreciably smaller than that for the corresponding jumps on smooth beds. Further, the length of the jump on the different corrugated beds was less than half of that on smooth beds. The integrated bed shear stress on the corrugated beds was more than 15 times that on smooth beds.

40|$|Abstract—Inundation maps {{of coastal}} marshes in western Louisiana were created with multitemporal Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture (ASAR) scenes {{collected}} {{before and during}} the three months after Hurricane Rita landfall in September 2005. Corroborated by inland water-levels, 7 days after landfall, 48 % of coastal estuarine and palustrine marshes remained inundated by storm-surge waters. Forty-five days after landfall, storm-surge inundated 20 % of those marshes. The end of the storm-surge flooding was marked by an abrupt decrease in water levels fol-lowing the passage of a storm front and persistent offshore winds. A complementary dramatic decrease in flood extent was confirmed by an ASAR-derived inundation map. In nonimpounded marshes at elevations 80 cm, storm-surge waters rapidly receded while slower recession was dominantly associated with impounded marshes at elevations 80 cm during the first month after Rita landfall. After this initial period, drainage from marshes—espe-cially impounded marshes—was hastened by the onset of offshore winds. Following the abrupt drops in inland water levels and flood extent, rainfall events coinciding with increased water levels were recorded as inundation re-expansion. This postsurge flooding decreased until only isolated impounded and palustrine marshes remained inundated. Changing flood extents were correlated to inland water levels and largely occurred within the same marsh regions. Trends related to incremental threshold increases used in the ASAR change-detection analyses seemed related to the preceding hydraulic and hydrologic events, and VV and HH threshold differences supported their relationship to the overall wetland <b>hydraulic</b> condition. <b>Index</b> Terms—Coastal marshes, flooding, hurricanes, radar, storm surge, topography.

Because of the large computational burden associated with the direct assessment of reliability, the indirect indices of reliability have recently received more attention in the framework of water distribution system design. Two new energy-related indices for reliability evaluation (i. e., available power <b>index</b> and pipe <b>hydraulic</b> resilience <b>index)</b> are developed in this paper. The performance of these new indices is evaluated and compared with that of four existing indices (three other energy-related indices-i. e., resilience index, network resilience index, and modified resilience index-and the entropy-based method, i. e., diameter-sensitive flow entropy) according to the following two-step methodology. In the first step, the application of the multiobjective optimization makes it possible to determine optimal network configurations that trade-offthe installation cost (to be minimized) against the generic indirect reliability index (to be maximized). In the second step, the performance of the optimal solutions in terms of explicit reliability assessment is examined under conditions in which the original network is perturbed by applying demand variations and random pipe failures to account for future operating uncertainties. The Hanoi and the Fossolo benchmark networks are used as case studies. The results obtained show that energy-based indices yield an overall superior estimate of reliability in comparison with the diameter-sensitive flow entropy. Furthermore, the new indices show some advantages in the evaluations performed under demand and pipe failure uncertainties.

One method that is used to study intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment to seawater intrusion is GALDIT method, which use hydrogeologically parameter groundwater occurrence (G), Aquifer hydraulic conductivity (A), High groundwater level above sealevel (L), distance from shore (D), Impact of existing status of sea water intrusion in the area (I) and thickness of aquifer (T). Vulnerability assessment method is done by assessing weight and ratings from each parameter. The result from the assessment then calculated to be GALDIT index. The result of GALDIT index is then classified based on vulnerability rate. GALDIT method parameters in the study area which were used to assess groundwater occurrence were confined and unconfined aquifer, <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>index</b> was 0. 2 to 8. 3 m/day, groundwater level elevation was 0. 3 to 4. 4 metres, distance from shore was less than 5400 metres, TDS index was 175 to 2000 ppm and thickness of aquifer was 2 to 35 metres. GALDIT index which calculated was 45 to 125. The intrinsic vulnerability rate which were assessed in the study area which classified from GALDIT index were very high in Tambakmulyo area, high in North Semarang area, moderate in North and Easth Semarang area, low in all district, and very low in South and Middle Semarang. The efforts that could be done to prevent from seawater intrusion were making injection well in shore area, used alternative water source, making a control of well and replanting the shore area...|$|R
40|$|Two {{arterial}} switch operations (ASO) {{designed for}} transposition of great arteries with ventricular septal defect are numerically assessed. To {{prove that the}} SRGA (spiral relationship of the normally related great arteries) arterial switch operation (ASO) is hemodynamically superior {{to that of the}} Lecompte procedure, three-dimensional Navier–Stokes simulations were carried out in the resulting two different vessels. In the mixed tri-quadratic finite element formulation, the streamline upwind model developed on the sup–inf-satisfying elements is employed to enhance convective stability. For the sake of accuracy, the degree of upwinding needed to enhance stability is analytically derived on the one-dimensional basis. For quantitative assessment of the two investigated operations, we calculate the pressure on the vessel surface and the wall shear stress from the simulated velocities. It is found that SRGA surgery is accompanied with lower pressure and higher shear stress, in comparison with those obtained from the Lecompte operation. Additionally, SRGA surgery results in much smaller areas of high pressure and low shear stress. Evidence is also given to show that the SRGA manoeuvre is less susceptible to stenosis. We also show that SRGA is the operation of choice for the ASO from the energy point of view since this anatomy is associated with smaller total energy loss coefficient and <b>hydraulic</b> dissipated power <b>index...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a technique for the identification, classification and quantification of instream flow environments. These features have been traditionally {{referred to as}} 'habitats' by lotic ecologists, in this research they are termed 'hydraulic biotopes'. The hydraulic biotope is the lowest of six nested levels of a hierarchical geomorphological model. This model has been developed {{as a tool to}} assist river managers, researchers and conservationists to categorise or classify rivers with respect to their geomorphic characteristics. Each level of the model provides data at a different level of resolution. This ranges from the broad scale catchment data to the site specific 'habitat' or hydraulic biotope data. Although this thesis is primarily concerned with the development of the hydraulic biotope, the interaction of all catchment variables needs to be recognised. Detailed analysis of hydraulic biotope data in the Buffalo River are presented within the broader hierarchical model. Consultation with lotic ecologists, together with a review of ecological literature, emphasised the need for a standardised terminology for the classification of ecologically significant instream flow environments. At present a fairly haphazard 'habitat' classification tends to be carried out by most researchers, this often leads to confusion in the identification and naming of different hydraulic biotopes ('habitats'). This confusion is exaggerated by the sharing of terminology between lotic ecology and fluvial geomorphology, usually for the categorisation of different types of features. A review of the ecological literature emphasises the importance of flow hydraulics within a river to describe the distribution of biota. The hydraulic variables considered to be most significant include velocity and depth. As river morphology directly determines the prevailing distribution of depth, velocity and substratum, it is obvious that there are important links to be made between fluvial geomorphology and lotic ecology. This thesis explores the potential of the hydraulic biotope as a tool to help develop those links. This thesis presents a standardised classification matrix for the identification of hydraulic biotopes. The matrix is simply based on water surface characteristics together with channel bed substratum. The validity of this matrix is tested by statistical analysis of hydraulic variables quantifying flow conditions within the various hydraulic biotope classes. Data is presented from four different river systems, each representing a different sedimentological environment. Where possible the influence of discharge has been considered. Results from more than 3000 data points show that hydraulic biotopes have distinct hydraulic characteristics in terms of velocity-depth ratio, Froude number, Reynolds number, 'roughness' Reynolds number and shear velocity. These <b>hydraulic</b> <b>indices</b> represent flow conditions both as an average within the water column, and near the bed. Statistical analysis shows that the hydraulic characteristics of the various hydraulic biotope classes are relatively consistent both within different fluvial environments and at different stages of flow. Unlike the morphological unit in which the hydraulic biotope is nested, in stream flow environments are shown to be temporally dynamic. Using the classification matrix as a tool for identification, hydraulic biotopes identified at one discharge are shown to be transformed from one class to another as a response to change in stage. The pattern of transformation is shown to be consistent within different sedimentological environments. An examination of the associations between hydraulic biotopes and morphological units demonstrates that, although some hydraulic biotopes are common to all morphological units (backwater pools, pools and runs), some features have specific associations. In this study rapids were found to be prevalent in bedrock pavement, bedrock pool and plane bed morphology, while cascades, chutes and riffles were common to plane bed, step and riffle morphology. Results from this research indicate that the hydraulic biotope, within the hierarchical geomorphological model, has the potential to aid the prediction of channel adjustment and associated 'habitat' (hydraulic biotope) transformation in response to changes in flow and sediment yield. These are likely to become increasingly important issues as South Africa strives to maintain a balance between the development of water resources {{to meet the needs of}} the rapidly expanding population, whilst at the same time maintaining the fluvial environment for sustainable use. ...|$|R
40|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is influenced by}} many factors, among which are subsoil structure and pore water pressure distribution. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary approach for the determination of these two factors and {{for the construction of}} a reliable model of the subsoil for the slope stability analysis. The case of a clay slope located in the Southern Apennines (Italy) is presented and discussed. Geophysical imaging (2 D electrical resistivity tomography—ERT), in situ geotechnical monitoring (measurements of pore pressures and horizontal displacements) and laboratory geotechnical tests (for the determination of <b>index,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> and mechanical properties of soils) have been carried out. The comparison and the integration between ERT images and direct observations of the material extracted from boreholes have allowed us to reconstruct the subsoil stratigraphy with continuity. Thus, a reliable 2 D model of the subsoil has been obtained, with well-defined boundaries on which it has been possible to apply appropriate hydraulic conditions. This geotechnical model has been used for studying the pore water pressure distribution and for analysing how the hydraulic boundary conditions—among which rain events—influence the slope stability. Our findings demonstrate the powerful skill of the ERT, if integrated with borehole data, to generate an accurate subsoil model. It is also evident that geophysical imaging can be a source of ambiguity and misjudgement if interpreted without a comparison with geotechnical data...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{extensive}} parametric sensitivity analysis of coupled consolidation and solute transport in composite landfill liner systems has been undertaken. The analysis incorporates results {{of more than}} 3000 simulations for various combinations of barrier thickness, waste loading rate, initial void ratio, compression <b>index,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and dispersion coefficient. However, {{it is noted that}} to limit the extent of the study a constant coefficient of consolidation is assumed in the analysis presented here, though this assumption is easily relaxed. Results of the parametric sensitivity analysis are succinctly presented using dimensionless plots, which allow the comparison of results for a large number of parameter values, and so the clear identification of the most important determinants on contaminant transport through the liner system. The dimensionless plots demonstrate a pessimum (for which the ‘breakthrough time’ is minimised). Numerical results reveal that in cases of extreme liner compressibility an order of magnitude reduction in contaminant transit time may arise due to coupling between solute transport and consolidation, while for barriers of low compressibility and porosity (such as well-engineered composite compacted clay landfill liners), it is found that the contaminant transit time may still be reduced by more than 30 %. The numerical results suggest that the use of coupled consolidation–contaminant transport models are sometimes required for informed and conservative landfill liner design...|$|R
