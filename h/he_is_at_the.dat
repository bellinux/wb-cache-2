5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E

500|$|Having been {{temporarily}} {{unable to}} begin production {{on the film}} for some time, due to De Laurentiis owning the rights, Lynch stopped actively pursuing Ronnie Rocket as a viability in the early 1990s. However, he has never officially abandoned the project; frequently referring to it in interviews as [...] "hibernating". The director has expressed interest in filming the project {{in the same manner}} as Eraserhead, using a small crew, building the sets himself and living on them during the length of the production. He has also claimed that he will revisit the film when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stage in his career [...] "when I don't really care what happens, except that the film is finished".|$|E

Throughout the whole video, Duff is shown performing the song with her band. The music video ranked at number one on Total Request Live. It was a staple on the UK incarnation of Total Request Live, reaching a peak of #4. In late August 2003 it was the most streamed music video on AOL.|$|E
500|$|During February and March, Yagan was {{involved}} in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken handkerchiefs. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help. The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted The Perth Gazette to remark on [...] "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee... For the most trivial offence ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head and front of any mischief." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his}} eye and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E

500|$|Lewis {{departed}} {{the show}} on 13 August 2010. In his exit storyline, he leaves the UK after stealing a large sum of money from Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) betting shop. Lewis carries out his plan to place fraudulently franked betting slips in the till while Audrey arranges to have her money transferred into a bank account for them to purchase their hotel. On the day of their farewell party in the Rovers, Lewis slips out to collect his money from the betting shop and kisses employee Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) when she becomes suspicious about his motives for being in the shop. Kate Woodward, writing for Inside Soap, said while Deirdre is attracted to Lewis, she ends their kiss and tells {{him to return to}} the party. However, Lewis flees the country, but decides not to take Audrey's money as well and he writes her a letter ending their relationship. [...] Havers filmed his final scenes on 21 June 2010 at a Manchester hotel, which doubled as an airport bar. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport, Lewis meets a businesswoman, Lydia Radcliffe (Lysette Anthony). Chris Johnson of the Daily Mail thought Lydia was a welcome distraction for Lewis, who is feeling guilty about what he has done. Lewis flirts with Lydia and [...] "rolls out some of his well-known chat-up lines", which she falls for. Lydia mentions she is travelling to Barbados and Lewis reveals he is going there too, so they board the plane together.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an opening caption that reads [...] "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while {{covering}} herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him}} and sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where {{a professor in the}} hall (the same man who appeared in their previous single's video [...] "Black Magic") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket over her shoulder and eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall off the chair.|$|E

500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", {{and that he}} wished he could provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes it to be an [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, there are clear differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E
