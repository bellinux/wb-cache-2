The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in Remarks on Colour.|$|E
25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Zion as primarily a community {{way of life that}} is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E

In this episode, when Tracy leaves the first {{rehearsal}} accusing Liz of racism he shouts [...] "race card!" [...] and hands Liz a card with [...] "race card" [...] written on it ("playing the race card" [...] is an expression that means introducing the issue of race into an argument in order to gain the upper hand). During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a black president now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way he is used to. Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E

Instead, a horizontal line occurs, after which the text continues, without a heading or anything explaining what is to be expected. The appendix has an appendix! Or, as we <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it as an later addition, it is properly termed an addendum, containing a colophon discussing the book's production, and an erratum. Unlike the endnotes, however, it is not referred to anywhere in the main body of the book, except in the table of contents, where it is mentioned as [...] "Accommodation of organized life to circumstances, by diverging ramifications." [...] This easily overlooked addendum is of course where Matthew laid out his theory of natural selection in a coherent way.|$|E

2500|$|Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE), theorized in the 1970s, {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman uses cocaine and thereby exposes her fetus to the drug. [...] "Crack baby" [...] was a term coined to describe children {{who were exposed to}} crack (freebase cocaine in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s {{in the midst of a}} crack epidemic. Other terms are [...] "cocaine baby" [...] and [...] "crack kid". [...] Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1997 book, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness, {{historian}} Rashid Khalidi {{notes that}} the archaeological strata that denote the history of Palestine—encompassing the Biblical, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Fatimid, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman periods—form part of {{the identity of the}} modern-day Palestinian people, as they <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it over the last century, but derides the efforts of some Palestinian nationalists to attempt to [...] "anachronistically" [...] read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact [...] "relatively modern." [...] Khalidi stresses that Palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one, with [...] "Arabism, religion, and local loyalties" [...] playing an important role. He argues that the modern national identity of Palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among the peoples of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century which sharpened following the demarcation of modern nation-state boundaries in the Middle East after World War I. He acknowledges that Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, though [...] "it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism." [...] Khalidi describes the Arab population of British Mandatory Palestine as having [...] "overlapping identities," [...] with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a Greater Syria, an Arab national project, as well as to Islam. He writes that,"local patriotism could not yet be described as nation-state nationalism." ...|$|E
