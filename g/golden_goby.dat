Tourist {{literature}} for the Winton area mentions angling as a worthwhile activity at the Conn Waterhole, with one brochure even describing it as a [...] "pretty picnic spot". A 2010 doctoral thesis whose fieldwork involved fish populations and movement in far western Queensland identified bony bream, silver tandan, golden perch and <b>golden</b> tank <b>goby</b> as fish found at the Conn Waterhole.|$|R
5000|$|Brachygobius nunus, the <b>Golden</b> banded <b>goby,</b> is {{a species}} of {{bumblebee}} goby, a small genus of gobies that takes its common name from their round bodies, big heads, and their overall yellow to golden coloration interrupted by four brown to black vertical stripes reminiscent of the striped pattern of a bumblebee. [...] They have also been figuratively described as [...] "buzzing" [...] from one surface to another inside the aquarium. [...] Like other members of its genus, it is popular as an aquarium fish.|$|R
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius auratus) is {{a species}} of goby native to coastal waters of the Eastern Atlantic from {{northern}} Spain to Madeira and the Canary Islands {{as well as in}} the Mediterranean Sea. It prefers areas with rocky substrates at depths of from 5 to 80 m (though usually not below 30 m) with plentiful growth of algae and gorgonians. This species can reach a length of 10 cm TL. It can also be found in the aquarium trade.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} an {{economically}} important fish, being sought after by local commercial fisheries and farmed. It {{can also be}} found in the aquarium trade. It is highly popular among the Chinese community due to its fine texture and tasty white flesh, and is believed to have healing properties. It is said, best eaten after surgeries or childbirths. In Malaysia, commercialization of this type of fish is not widely established. Demands are largely dependent on wild populations, thus fetching high prices in the market. In Thailand, this species has been cited in to the folk tale of Central Thailand's plā bū̀ thxng ("ปลาบู่ทอง"; <b>golden</b> <b>goby)</b> tales have known as well, and was taken to create a television series and movies several times. The content is similar to Cinderella.|$|E
40|$|Fish {{living in}} highly {{variable}} and unpredictable environments need to possess life-history strategies that {{enable them to}} survive environmental extremes such as floods and drought. We used the length-frequency distributions of multiple fish species in multiple seasons and highly variable hydrological conditions to infer antecedent breeding behaviour in rivers of far-western Queensland, Australia. Hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) recruitment of some or all species of fish would occur within waterholes during no-flow periods; (2) there would be seasonal recruitment responses in some fish species; (3) recruitment of some species would be enhanced by channel flows and/or flooding. Hydrology and the incidence of flooding were highly variable across the study area during 2006 - 2008. Flood-influenced recruitment was evident for Hyrtl's tandan, Barcoo grunter and Welch's grunter. Silver tandan, <b>golden</b> <b>goby,</b> Cooper Creek catfish and Australian smelt showed evidence of seasonal recruitment unrelated to antecedent hydrology. However, most species demonstrated continual recruitment in isolated waterholes, irrespective of antecedent flow conditions and season. Continual and seasonal recruitment capabilities have obvious advantages over flood-pulse recruitment in rivers with highly unpredictable flood regimes and underpin the persistence of many fish species in arid and semiarid rivers.
