2500|$|HiPER {{differs from}} most ICF devices {{in that it}} also {{includes}} {{a second set of}} lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This [...] "stretches" [...] the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5kJ each to generate a total of 200kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3kJ to generate a total of 70kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research. <b>Frequency</b> <b>multiplication</b> will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light.

In addition, simplified models are proposed, which contribute to the calculation of the edge frequencies of the band gaps and enhance the understanding of the LR mechanism of PCs. The accuracy of the simplified models is proven by comparing them with the results derived from the analytical model under different {{beam structure}} parameters. The results suggest that lower frequencies and ranges of <b>frequency</b> <b>multiplications</b> can be achieved in the band gaps which are obtained from the new beam structure with multioscillators in a unit cell.
