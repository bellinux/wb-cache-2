It is native to California and Baja California, where it has a disjunct distribution, {{occurring}} in the Klamath Mountains and mountain ranges several hundred miles to the south. It grows in rocky mountainous habitat, on cliffs of limestone rock substrate, and on forest ridges. This lycophyte grows in flat mats with many short, <b>forking</b> <b>stems</b> twisted together. The stems fragment easily, especially as they dry. The lance-shaped green leaves are up to 5 or 6 millimeters long, including the soft bristles at their tips. The leaves are alike in shape and borne in squarish whorls of four about the stem. They are flattened to the stem.|$|R
50|$|Selaginella wallacei is {{a species}} of spikemoss known by the common name Wallace's spikemoss. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Montana, {{where it can be}} found in many types of habitat, {{including}} open and shaded areas, and wet to dry environments. This lycophyte is variable in appearance, its form depending on the habitat it grows in. It can be spreading with many narrow branches, or a small, dense mat. The <b>forking</b> <b>stems</b> grow up to about 25 centimeters long, but may remain much shorter in dry conditions. They are lined with linear, lance-shaped, or oblong leaves up to 4 millimeters long including the bristles at the tips. The strobili containing the reproductive structures may be quite long, reaching up to 9 centimeters.|$|R
50|$|This {{is often}} an annual herb, though ssp. chartacea may be a {{short-lived}} perennial. It produces a short, spreading stem that branches many times {{to take on a}} mat-like form. The stem is no more than 20 centimeters long. It is lined with occasional small, leathery leaves which are oblong to triangular in form and just a few millimeters long. The ends of the <b>forking</b> <b>stem</b> branches are dense, highly divided cymes of many tiny flowers. The flowers generally have five sepals, stamens, and other parts, but they may have 3 or 4 parts, a trait unique among the North American Paronychia species. The sepals are brownish or purplish fading to thinned, papery, whitish or translucent edges. The fruit is a minute utricle measuring half a millimeter long. The two subspecies differ in size; ssp. minima has a smaller caudex and smaller inflorescences.|$|R

It is native to Baja California {{as well as some}} {{locations}} just north of the border in San Diego County, California. It grows in dry habitat, often on clay soil, both in open areas and in the shade of larger plants. This lycophyte forms mats of spreading, <b>forking</b> <b>stems</b> up to 18 centimeters long. The plant is often gray or brown in color, forming a dull-colored carpet on the substrate. The linear or lance-shaped leaves are 1 to 3 millimeters long and lack bristles at the tips.

The strobili borne at the leaf bases are yellow in color and no more than 4 to 5 millimeters long.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} was to {{characterize}} Norway spruce clones in terms of bud burst, flowering and morphological features. Observation and measurements were carried out in the Norway spruce seed orchard of the Bielsk Forest District in the north-eastern part of Poland. The seed orchard was established in 1989 and consists of 428 grafts of over 37 trees from the Białowieża Primeval Forest. An assessment of bud burst, <b>stem</b> <b>forking,</b> <b>stem</b> form, crown width, branch thickness, vitality, flowering and fructification as well as diameter measurements was done in 2013 and 2014. The results showed variability of morphological features among different clones as well as within individual clones. Differences among clones in spring bud development, stem form and branch thickness were statistically significant. Additionally, a positive correlation between male and female flowering was observed. The research also confirmed an influence of the healthiness of the grafts on seed production with trees in a weakened state producing more seeds...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} protein-protein interactions in live Bacillus subtilis cells (a bacterium). B. subtilis’ natural habitat is {{the soil and}} the roots of plants, but also the human microbiota. B. subtilis is used worldwide as a model organism. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria do not have organelles and therefore {{it was thought that}} the interior of bacteria is an unorganized mess. But bacteria do have a ‘skelet’: the cytoskeleton. More and more is known about the organization inside bacteria {{and it turns out that}} many proteins have a specific location in the cell. Protein complexes might be the bacterial equivalent of eukaryotic organelles. Earlier research suggests that protein complexes have a transient nature; they are formed when necessary and fall apart afterwards. During this research we studied the dynamics of a few protein complexes; of some proteins involved in sugar metabolism. This has been studied here in live bacteria with a miroscope. The method that we used to study protein-protein interactions is called FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer). The principle of FRET can be explained with two <b>stem</b> <b>forks.</b> When one <b>stem</b> <b>fork</b> is excited it starts to vibrate; thereby spreading a wave. A second <b>stem</b> <b>fork</b> can absorb this wave if it is nearby and will start to vibrate with the same frequency.

40|$|Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seed origins {{from the}} Baltic countries, Finland and Russia were {{compared}} for survival, growth and stem quality, {{and the effect}} of latitudinal seed transfer distance examined in two provenance trials. The trials were located on moist upland forest soils at Tuusula (60 ° 21 ’N) in southern Finland and at Viitasaari (63 ° 11 ’N) in central Finland. The material consisted of 21 stand and single tree origins ranging from latitudes 54 ° to 63 °N. Survival, height, dbh, relative stem taper, stem volume/ha and the proportion of trees with a stem defect (vertical branch or <b>forked</b> <b>stem),</b> were assessed when the trees were 22 years old. Significant differences were detected among the origins regarding all the measured traits in both trials. Southern Finnish origins produced the highest volume per unit area in central Finland, whereas Estonian and north Latvian stand seed origins, as well as the southern Finnish plus tree origins, were the most productive ones in southern Finland. The more southern the origin, the higher was the proportion of trees with a stem defect in both trials. The latitudinal seed transfer distance had a significant but relatively small effect on survival, stem volume/ ha and proportion of trees with a stem defect.

40|$|While {{significant}} {{factors that}} affect the open source community’s interest {{to participate in a}} development project have been studied, there has been little focus on the motivating factors that can cause a contributor to become a competitor by utilizing the right to fork a program i. e., to copy an existing program’s code base and use it to begin a separate development. The right to copy an existing program’s code base and use it to begin a separate development is guaranteed by all open source licenses. However, this right to fork a program is rarely exercised. Indeed, there is strong social pressure against code <b>forking</b> <b>stemming</b> from the negative side effects of code forking, such as conflict and duplicated efforts among developers. This paper details the events that led Widenius, the founder of the MySQL project, to decide to fork MariaDB from MySQL. Our findings confirm the previously held notion that there is a high threshold for starting a competing fork. While the few studies that exist of competitive forks find the reasons to be due to disagreement among developers, in the case of MariaDB the fork was caused by Widenius’ concerns regarding the uncertainty of the future freedom and openness of the MySQL codebase. This article makes three contributions. Firstly, it further validates the existing notion that there is a strong threshold to starting a competing fork. Secondly, it offers an in-depth analysis of the events and motivations behind the birth of a fork. Thirdly, it contributes to theory by introducing the freedom factor hypothesis: limiting either developers’ freedoms to contribute to a project or the freedom inherent in a project's license increases the likelihood of a fork...|$|R

40|$|Khaya senegalensis {{has been}} {{promoted}} as the most promising farm-forestry timber species in the Townsville region, {{but there has been}} little systematic analysis of expected growth rates or silvicuItural prescriptions. This presentation provides an assessment of silvicultural practices and prescriptions, based on two data sets: a network of growth plots established by DEEDI within 150 kilometres of Townsville, and a Nelder Fan Wheel established on the campus of James Cook University. For stands aged between 5 and 10 years, average growth rates were between 6. 0 and 9. 0 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1, with the fastest growth of 13. 5 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1 recorded on a free-draining site. Woodlots were typically planted at 4. 0 x 4. 0 m spacing (625 sph) or 2. 5 x 4. 0 m spacing (1000 sph). Total volume did not vary greatly with stand density. This supports the calculation of optimum stand density of 543 stems per hectare (sph) in the Nelder Wheel. Tree form {{did not appear to be}} correlated with stand density. Small-scale woodlots are managed more intensively than broadscale plantations, so the significance of spacing on weed growth is less important. Woodlot owners typically undertake more pruning operations than could be economically justified, including deformed and <b>forked</b> <b>stems</b> which have no potential for timber production. Thinning should be undertaken well before crowns become interlocked, for ease of operation. Planting Khaya senegalensis at densities greatly in excess of 625 sph is seen as inefficient: the main advantage is to provide selection intensity for thinning, however this will be less important in future given the availability of improved seed and clones selected for straightness. Wide-spaced Khaya senegalensis may be suitable for silvo-pastoral agroforestry systems in the seasonally-dry tropical lowlands around Townsville...|$|R
