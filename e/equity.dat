5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make <b>equity</b> investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer of auto parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' <b>equity</b> either directly or via private <b>equity</b> funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total <b>equity.</b> IFC’s private <b>equity</b> portfolio currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The portfolio is widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. Other <b>equity</b> investments made by the IFC include preferred <b>equity,</b> convertible loans, and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering. When the IFC invests in a company, it does not assume an active role in management of the company.|$|E

The empirical results indicate that international real estate <b>equities</b> offer higher returns as well as greater total and systematic risk than U. S. -based REITs. The results also indicate that international real estate <b>equities</b> are weakly positively correlated with the return on REITs. International real estate <b>equities</b> achieve higher values for both the Treynor and Jensen measures than either the S&P 500 Index or the World <b>Equities</b> Index. International real estate <b>equities</b> also outperform domestic real estate companies on a risk-adjusted basis. However, international real estate <b>equities</b> underperform the World <b>Equities</b> Index using the Sharpe Index which suggests that international real estate <b>equities</b> carry significant unsystematic risk. ...|$|R

5|$|Napoli {{shareholder}} <b>equity</b> on 30 June 2005 was {{a negative}} of €261,466, which the club started from €3 million capital and re-capitalized €3.8 million during 2004–05 Serie C1. On 30 June 2006 the <b>equity</b> was increased to €211,220, as the net loss {{was backed by}} a re-capitalisation of €9.3 million + €261,466 for previous net loss. On 30 June 2007 the <b>equity</b> was increased to €1,961,975, due to the net profit and a re-capitalisation of €288,780 (to make the share capital back to €500,000). On 30 June 2008 the <b>equity</b> was increased to €13,829,015 with a capital increase of just €1,000. The net income contributed the increase in <b>equity</b> on 30 June 2009, which was €24,763,537. On 30 June 2010 the <b>equity</b> was at €25,107,223. On 30 June 2011 the <b>equity</b> was increased to €29,305,052.

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over <b>equity</b> matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over <b>equity</b> matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear <b>equity</b> cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear <b>equity</b> appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the <b>equity</b> of Aspmyra Stadion AS.
