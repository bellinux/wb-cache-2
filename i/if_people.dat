5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; <b>if</b> <b>people</b> then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting <b>if</b> <b>people</b> come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually <b>if</b> <b>people</b> from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E

5|$|Fady can {{not only}} help protect lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> move to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E

40|$|After {{making a}} choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more {{positively}} and their rejected item more negatively (i. e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm’s (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even <b>if</b> <b>people’s</b> attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, <b>if</b> <b>people’s</b> ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even <b>if</b> <b>people’s</b> preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot {{have been caused by}} choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it...|$|R
50|$|Critically, Hewstone et al. (2002) have {{questioned}} the causal direction between self-esteem and death-anxiety, asking questions such as, <b>if</b> <b>people's</b> need for self-esteem comes from the overall desire to reduce their death anxiety, {{or if it is}} the opposite. Individuals' reduction of death anxiety is coming from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.|$|R
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see <b>if</b> <b>people</b> would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) {{money that they}} could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed <b>if</b> <b>people</b> have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference <b>if</b> <b>people</b> are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
