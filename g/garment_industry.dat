5|$|Hsu fled to Hong Kong {{and lived}} there from 1992 to 1996 {{while working in}} the <b>garment</b> <b>industry.</b> He started at least two {{companies}} there, both with vague charters. Aided by what others described as a magnetic personality, he prospered for a while, living in a luxury building. However the companies were dissolved in 1997 and 1998, and by 1998 Hong Kong courts had declared Hsu once again bankrupt. He would not emerge from this Hong Kong bankruptcy until 2006.|$|E
5|$|Hsu then {{returned}} to the United States in the late 1990s, despite his fugitive status, and established several addresses in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. He became an investor in Silicon Valley, invested in real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area, and still had engagements in the <b>garment</b> <b>industry.</b> He later relocated to New York, where he seemed to become involved in the apparel business once again and lived in a luxury apartment in SoHo while flying chartered jets.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sustainable Development Planning and Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Corporate Social Responsibility {{is a new}} agenda {{within the}} {{sustainable}} development debates. There have been several debates to question the role of business on the social and community linked issues such as HIV and AIDS which not only threatens their own survival but {{the very existence of}} the workforce and the communities. The debate also questions the role of the business on social accountability as to whether they should be held accountable and responsible for their actions to the employees and the wider society. In view of this debate the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential role of Corporate Social Responsibility in management of HIV and AIDS at work place-a Case Study of <b>Garment</b> <b>Industries</b> in Thetsane, Maseru. Objective: To investigate the approaches used by <b>Garment</b> <b>Industries</b> in management of HIV and AIDS at workplace. Secondly, to investigate what contributes to the differences in the approaches between different <b>garment</b> <b>industries,</b> and finally to explore the factors, which motivated <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> to adopt these approaches or programmes. This was a case study involving four <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> that have work place programmes. Findings: <b>Garment</b> <b>industries</b> have limited resources to support HIV and Aids programmes at work place. Majority of the <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> depend on support from the development agencies and the private Doctors, in the area of condom distribution, awareness, education and provision of medical care to their employees...|$|R

5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E
5|$|Geraldine Ferraro {{was born}} on August 26, 1935 in Newburgh, New York, the {{daughter}} of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, Campania) and owner of two restaurants. She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. Her father {{died of a heart}} attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> to support them.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in New York, where he knew nobody and spoke no English, Berkman became an anarchist through his {{involvement}} with groups that had formed to campaign to free the men convicted of the 1886 Haymarket bombing. He joined the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist group in the U.S. The group was affiliated with the International Working People's Association, the organization to which the Haymarket defendants had belonged, and they regarded the Haymarket men as martyrs. Since most of its members worked in the <b>garment</b> <b>industry,</b> the Pioneers of Liberty took part in strikes against sweatshops and helped establish {{some of the first}} Jewish labor unions in the city. Before long, Berkman was one of the prominent members of the organization.|$|E

5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The <b>garment</b> <b>industry</b> is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the <b>garment</b> <b>industry.</b> In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Bangladesh readymade {{garments}} {{sector has}} started {{the trend of}} implementing ‘lean manufacturing’. To remain competitive in the global market the most important task for <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> {{is to reduce the}} lead time which is also important for long-term stable development. A headlong rush to reduce lead time by becoming lean has created urgency for researchers and practitioners to apply new tools and techniques for dictating wastages. This research addresses the application of value stream mapping in <b>garments</b> <b>industry</b> to implement lean manufacturing. Value stream mapping is different than conventional recording approaches as it helps in the visualization of Material Flow, Information Flow, cycle times and utilization of resources. With the assurance of effective integration and communication, lean systems can be achieved with better efficiency. This research will stand as a benchmark to implement lean for other <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> in Bangladesh. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are about}} 4, 000 <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> in Bangladesh, {{most of them}} are {{clustered}} in and around the capital city.

This study investigates the impact of <b>garment</b> <b>industries</b> on transportation, in particular road safety issues of garment workers. Data is collected to identify the locational problems of garment factories, spatial distribution of worker residences, and their travel pattern as well as to assess their walking and road crossing problems.
