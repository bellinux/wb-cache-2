5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough <b>for</b> <b>conversation.</b> As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect.

25|$|Other practical, {{though not}} {{commonly}} needed, applications for campfires include drying wet clothing, alleviating hypothermia, and distress signaling. Most campfires, though, are exclusively for recreation, {{often as a}} venue <b>for</b> <b>conversation,</b> storytelling, or song. Another traditional campfire activity involves impaling marshmallows on sticks or uncoiled wire coat hangers, and roasting them over the fire. Roasted marshmallows may {{also be used for}} s'mores.|$|E

Encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbours, about the weather, about the hard times, about the public games, and about the education of their children. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious wealthy of his age.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{was born}} in Schönhausen, a wealthy family estate {{situated}} west of Berlin in the Prussian province of Saxony. His father, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck (1771–1845), was a Junker estate owner and a former Prussian military officer; his mother, Wilhelmine Luise Mencken (1789–1839), was the well educated daughter of a senior government official in Berlin. He had two siblings, Bernhard (1810–1893) and Malwine (1827–1908). The world saw Bismarck as a typical Prussian Junker, an image that he encouraged by wearing military uniforms. Bismarck was well educated and cosmopolitan with a gift <b>for</b> <b>conversation.</b> In addition to his native German, he was fluent in English, French, Italian, Polish and Russian.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Old Ebbitt Grill was busiest on {{weekends}} in the spring, when {{high school student}} tourist business was at its highest in the city. The restaurant was praised by the Washington Post {{for being able to}} accommodate large groups, offering a variety of plain and upscale food, providing friendly service, and having the best raw bar in the city. The restaurant was also criticized by the newspaper for being too noisy <b>for</b> <b>conversation,</b> and providing bland hamburgers, salads, and breakfast. By 2008, however, Old Ebbitt Grill had improved. Post food critic Tom Sietsema continued to laud the friendly service. He also praised the Breakfast Club, a deep-fried ham, French toast, and bacon breakfast sandwich; he appreciated small touches such as coat hooks near booths and pepper mills on tables; and found the staff's honesty about menu choices refreshing.|$|E

500|$|She once {{requested}} that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move; Jarrett {{is now one}} of her husband's closest advisors. The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, , that [...] "Tired and stressed, we had little time <b>for</b> <b>conversation,</b> much less romance." [...] However, despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to attempt to schedule date nights while they lived in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|In 1972 Dunstan {{separated}} from his wife and moved into a small flat in Kent Town, adjacent to Norwood. The family home was sold as two {{of the children were}} already studying in university. In 1974 the couple were finally divorced. Dunstan notes this period as being initially a [...] "very bleak and lonely" [...] time for him. In absence of his family, he made new friends and acquaintances. Friends living nearby would come to his apartment <b>for</b> <b>conversation</b> and good food—cooking was Dunstan's hobby. Dunstan bought another house in 1974, partially financed from a then-unpublished cookbook. In 1976, Don Dunstan's Cookbook was published—the first cookbook released by a serving Australian leader. More generally, Dunstan promoted a revolution in fine dining in the state. Encouraged by Dunstan's enthusiasm for multiculturalism, many new restaurants were opened by proprietors and the diversity of cuisine increased. He also promoted the viticulture industry through his patronage of wine festivals.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of Chief of Staff {{for a general}} was usually held by a more junior officer, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond mere communication of orders to duties that involved actual management of his Army of the Cumberland. Rosecrans had a voracious appetite <b>for</b> <b>conversation,</b> especially when {{he was unable to}} sleep; in Garfield, he found [...] "the first well read person in the Army" [...] and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night. The two became close in spite of Garfield's being twelve years junior to Rosecrans, and their talks covered all topics, especially religion; Rosecrans, who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism, succeeded in softening Garfield's view of his faith. Garfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders Alexander McCook and Thomas Crittenden, whom he believed ineffective, but Rosecrans ignored the suggestions. With Rosecrans, Garfield devised the Tullahoma Campaign to pursue and trap Confederate General Braxton Bragg in Tullahoma. After initial Union success, Bragg retreated toward Chattanooga, where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies. Garfield argued for an immediate advance, in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln. After a council of war and lengthy deliberations, Rosecrans agreed to attack.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he noted}} that {{his support for the}} majority's opinion was [...] "unqualified", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement. Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement. Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "it is likely [...] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity <b>for</b> <b>conversation</b> or interaction with anyone". Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators" [...] and that solitary confinement [...] "bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy". Justice Kennedy conceded that [...] "in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates", but that courts should ultimately determine [...] "whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them".|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest {{has become}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it {{is used as a}} common topic <b>for</b> <b>conversation</b> in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan's national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that [...] "the common wisdom is that if you ask someone from Japan to draw 'Slime,' he'll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game." [...] With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida's Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool's Hoax, Google announced a [...] "NES version" [...] of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest.|$|E
