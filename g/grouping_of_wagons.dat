5000|$|A wagon master was {{the person}} hired to oversee the {{transportation}} <b>of</b> a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{from one place to}} another. On the American frontier, the term usually applies to the person responsible for assisting <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> immigrants or pioneers from the eastern U.S. to the western U.S. Wagon masters were also hired to oversee shipments of cargo or mail. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> traveling together were referred to as a [...] "train".|$|R
50|$|A {{wagon train}} is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{traveling}} together. In a military context, a baggage train was the wagon train that followed an army with supplies and ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|As western {{settlement}} grew, certain common details {{began to}} emerge. Most pioneers traveled in <b>wagon</b> trains, <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> containing settlers and their families. They banded together for common defense and to combine their efforts.|$|R
50|$|The later <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{was built}} in {{anticipation}} of the construction of the new Parliament House in Canberra. This was achieved with block trains running regularly from Somerton to Canberra on the standard gauge line.|$|R
50|$|Built as a horse-operated tramway, {{the early}} {{operations}} followed that model, with short <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> hauled by horses. Although the line {{had been designed}} {{with a view to}} gravitational operation for loaded traffic towards Devoran, it appears that this was not done, and the wagons were hauled in both directions.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the pro-Rand armies are {{situated}} {{on a ridge}} around Dumai's Wells. The Shaido have betrayed the Aes Sedai and have surrounded a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> on which the Aes Sedai {{are situated}}, and are trying unsuccessfully to overwhelm its defenders to kidnap Rand al'Thor for themselves when the Pro Rand forces arrive.|$|R
50|$|In {{migration}} settings, {{such as the}} emigrant {{trails of}} the American West and the Great Trek <b>of</b> South Africa, <b>wagons</b> would travel together for support, navigation and protection. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{may be used to}} create an improvised fort called a laager, made by circling them to form an enclosure. In these settings, a chuckwagon is a small wagon used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{gunpowder}} warfare meant that an army {{could no longer}} rely solely on foraging in the surrounding countryside, and required a regular supply of munitions. In the 18th century, organized commissary and quartermaster departments were developed to centralize delivery of supplies. The delivery {{took the form of}} [...] "baggage trains", large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> that traveled {{at the rear of the}} main army.|$|R
2500|$|The Lynchburg stage road, about [...] {{north of}} the {{railroad}} station, was the main route between Appomattox Court House and Lynchburg that was available to Lee's army. Near Appomattox Station, along the Lynchburg road, the Confederates had parked a hospital train, a large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> and about 100 artillery pieces. A small infantry unit, mostly armed artillerymen, and the 500-man cavalry detachment of Brigadier General Martin Gary's command guarded the wagon park.|$|R
5000|$|In 1843, Whitman {{traveled}} east, and on {{his return}} he helped lead the first large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> trains west from Fort Hall, in southeastern Idaho. Known as the [...] "Great Emigration", it established {{the viability of the}} Oregon Trail for later homesteaders. Not having much success with converting the Cayuse, the Whitmans gave more attention to the settlers. They took in children to their own home and established a boarding school for settlers' children.|$|R
5000|$|Foma's {{grandfather}} {{takes care}} of melons and {{spends most of his}} time at a shanty nearby, taking pleasure in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> that come by with various items. One day, while discussing matters with some passing wagoneers, his grandfather decides to outdo Foma and his friend at dancing. He does quite well until he reaches a spot in the garden where he cannot seem to move and his legs stiffen up. He curses the devil, and tries his luck again.|$|R
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early <b>wagons</b> were <b>of</b> all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel <b>wagons.</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>of</b> the same design are classed {{together by a}} multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner <b>of</b> the <b>wagon,</b> the second represents the general type <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|R
50|$|Introduction of the VHHY class <b>wagons</b> allowed {{cascading}} <b>of</b> {{the older}} <b>wagons</b> for then-new rice traffic, developing in the north-eastern {{areas of the}} state; these wagons were coded VHRF/X. Records {{are hard to find}} but it appears a fairly random assortment <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> were converted, totalling at least 23 wagons. Photographed wagons include 12 and 16 as VHRX and 22, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 36, 39, 40, 43, 44, 59-61, 65-67, 69, 70, 72 and 78 as VHRF; based on this it seems reasonable to assume that other conversions, if any, would have come from the aluminium-built <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> Since the Pacific National takeover these wagons have all reverted to their previous grain classifications.|$|R
50|$|A Nahgüterzug (abbreviation: Ng) is {{the name}} given to a {{category}} of local goods train in German-speaking countries. It describes a type of goods train that, unlike the Durchgangsgüterzug (through goods train) - does not stay together for its entire journey; instead wagons can be added or dropped off at intermediate stations en route. And unlike the Übergabegüterzug (goods exchange train) Nahgüterzüge run from one railway hub to another, usually between two marshalling yards. Along the way various <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> are detached or collected at the intermediate stations.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{transfer}} of freight from road freight to railway freight transport. In railway transport, individual <b>wagons</b> or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> with a maximum number of five are used. Combined transport is used for commodity flows. Goods are loaded in ISO 1 containers with an outer length of 20 or 40 feet. Special ramps allow goods to be transported from the ramp to the container and vice versa. The system {{can be used for}} storage device, distribution and logistics centres with railway connections to public railway transport...|$|R
5000|$|Whishaw {{lists the}} [...] "inclinations" [...] on the route; only one is steeper than 1 in 100, at Causewayend {{where the line}} descends {{to the level of}} the canal at a {{gradient}} of 1 in 22. The length of this incline is 800 yards and it is [...] "to be worked by a fixed engine of 50-horse power". This was a rope-worked inclined plane, where <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> were hauled up or let down under the control of the rope.Whishaw states that the rest of the line is [...] "to be worked by locomotive engines".|$|R
30|$|We {{focus on}} {{planning}} problems arising from wagonload traffic, which functions as follows: A customer wants to transport a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> from A to B by train. The number <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{is too small}} to justify direct transport. Therefore, it is necessary to bundle them with wagons from other origin-destination-pairs (relations) for certain parts of their routes. Trains can be separated and sorted to new trains in classification and marshalling yards which are distributed all over the railway network. The sorting process (called reclassification) is very expensive and time-consuming. Hence, it is necessary to balance reclassifications and transport distance. Transport costs per kilometer depend on several factors, e.g., personnel, energy and infrastructural costs.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, {{when he was}} 53, Barlow's family {{arrived in}} Oregon. His party <b>of</b> seven <b>wagons</b> joined Joel Palmer's <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 23 <b>wagons</b> and {{explored}} and, after considerable difficulty, blazed a wagon trail over the Cascade Range, which became the Barlow Road in 1846. They arrived in Oregon City, Oregon on Christmas night.|$|R
40|$|In wagonload traffic, a {{production}} form in railway freight traffic, small <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> {{have to be}} transported. In order to decrease transportation costs, wagons from different relations are consolidated. In railyards trains can be separated and rearranged to new trains. The costs arising from this process, which is called reclassification, must be balanced with the transportation costs. The minimization of total costs can be formulated as a network optimization model. We introduce a branch-and-price approach for the considered problem. Moreover, we present specialized cuts, which {{can be incorporated into}} the branching scheme. Solutions obtained from our implementation can keep up with results computed by CPLEX...|$|R
50|$|Teichwolframsdorf {{station was}} opened on 29 August 1876 as a halt and redesignated as a station in 1905. In {{addition}} to the entrance building, the station was equipped with workshops which are still partly preserved. From 1953 until its closure before 1962, a railway connection from Katzendorf to Teichwolframsdorf and sächsischen Aufbereitungsbetrieben (Saxon processing operations) was used by uranium ore trains running as block trains or in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> With the abandonment of rail traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster), the station was closed on 30 May 1999. It {{is located on the}} outskirts of the Thuringian village of Teichwolframsdorf in the Werdau forest.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Liu {{informed}} Shi {{that the}} reason why Emperor Wuzong {{did not want to}} launch a major campaign to wipe out the Huigu remnants was that his aunt Princess Taihe, who had previously married Huigu's Chongde Khan under the heqin system of marriage alliance, was being held by Wujie Khan. He thus planned, with Shi, to launch a surprise attack to rescue Princess Taihe. In spring 843, when Wujie Khan was attacking Zhenwu, Liu had Shi and Wang Feng (王逢) command the soldiers under the Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Chixin, as well as Qibi (契苾) and Tuoba (拓拔, i.e., Dangxiang) tribesmen, to serve as forward troops, while his own army followed. When Shi arrived at Zhenwu, he ascended the city walls and surveyed the Huigu camps, when he saw that there were a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> where the people appeared to be wearing Chinese uniforms of red and green colors and appeared to be Chinese. He sent a spy to those wagons, and the spy found out that the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> were under Princess Taihe and her attendants. Shi informed the princess {{that he was about to}} launch an attack, and that the princess should remain calm during the attack and remain where she was. At night, he launched a surprise attack on Wujie Khan's tent, surprising him and causing him to flee. Shi, after killing some 10,000 Huigu people and receiving the surrender of some 20,000 people, escorted Princess Taihe back to Tang territory. [...] Shi was subsequently made the defender of Tiande.|$|R
5000|$|The Nauvoo Legion {{was called}} {{up again in}} the Utah War against Federal troops {{entering}} Utah in the [...] "Utah Expedition" [...] from 1857-1858. They employed tactics of supply destruction and avoided direct fighting. Local commanders {{and members of the}} Iron County, Utah Territorial Militia, overcome with suspicion and war hysteria, perpetrated the Mountain Meadows Massacre against a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> trains travelling from Arkansas to California in September. At this point Daniel H. Wells was the chief military commander of the militia. It was also {{under the auspices of the}} militia that the <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> men were organized who were instructed to burn down Salt Lake City and other parts of northern Utah should the invading army try to take up residence.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{its current}} name, the {{southern}} part of this road was by no means passable by wagons until later colonial times. The 1751 Fry-Jefferson map on this page notes the term [...] "Waggon" [...] only north of Winchester, Virginia. In 1753, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> travelers reported that [...] "the good road ended at Augusta" [...] (now Staunton, Virginia), although they did keep going all the way to Winston-Salem. By all accounts, it was never a comfortable route. The lines <b>of</b> settlers' covered <b>wagons</b> moving south were matched by a line <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> full <b>of</b> agricultural produce heading north to urban markets; these were interspersed with enormous herds of cattle, hogs, and other livestock being driven north to market. Although there surely would have been pleasant areas for travel, road conditions also could vary from deep mud to thick dust, mixed with animal waste. Inns generally provided only the most basic food and a space to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|In warfare, large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> supply <b>wagons</b> {{were used}} to support {{traveling}} armies with food and munitions, forming [...] "baggage trains". During the American Civil War, these wagon trains would often be accompanied by the <b>wagons</b> <b>of</b> private merchants, known as sutlers, who sold goods to soldiers, {{as well as the}} <b>wagons</b> <b>of</b> photographers and news reporters. [...] Special purpose-built support wagons existed for blacksmithing, telegraphy and even observation ballooning.|$|R
50|$|From 1953 {{until its}} closure before 1962, a rail link ran from Katzendorf to Teichwolframsdorf {{and from there}} to the sächsischen Aufbereitungsbetrieben (Saxon {{processing}} operations), which was used by uranium ore trains running as block trains or in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> The loading <b>of</b> uranium ore mined in the open-cast mine of Culmitzsch began in 1957 and the transport of ore to Lengenfeld, Dresden-Gittersee, Tannenbergsthal and Crossen bei Zwickau for further processing began. A 2.2 km-long connection from Gauern to the Culmitzsch loading yard was opened on 11 September 1958; it was closed in 1966. When the Neue Fabrik ("new factory") processing plant (AB 102) in Seelingstädt was opened in 1960, the Culmitz ore traffic was transferred from Seelingstädt station to the processing plant via the Taigakurve (Taiga curve).|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a large}} fall in {{elevation}} {{from the}} mines to the ports, and to optimise the haulage capacity available at the time, the line was laid out with generally moderate gradients, but with four inclines (sometimes referred to as inclined planes). The inclines carried the railway down a steep hillside, and the [...] "trains" [...] (or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons)</b> were controlled by a rope, hauled or let out from an engine house or other control location {{at the head of}} the incline. Generally locomotives were used to haul the trains to and from the ends of the inclines, and did not themselves travel with the train. However horse traction was used west of the Angarrack incline at first, but from 1843 locomotives worked over the incline, using the rope for traction and braking, and to from there Hayle.|$|R
50|$|This small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 20 <b>wagons</b> was {{constructed}} {{over the period}} 1963 to 1965. The design is basically a stretched version of the VLX louvre van, with many similar concepts. The interior was expanded from 20 to 26 standard pallets. The vans were also limited to 50 LT maximum capacity. The sides <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> were limited internally to 7 ft tall. There was more room in the centre, but the door heights {{would have been an}} issue.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the largest}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> flat <b>wagons</b> {{both in terms of}} variety and numbers. Their {{classification}} as special wagons arises either as a result of not having a wagon deck that is drivable or due to their axle count. Unlike the standard wagons, these flats are predominantly optimised for a specific purpose. In 1998 the DB had about 22,000 Class S wagons in its fleet.|$|R

The last four wheeled open wagons were built in 1958, but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|R
50|$|The story {{starts out}} in the 1860s with Ned Bannon coming across cattle rustlers who shoot him and leave him for dead, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> {{trainers}} finding Ned Bannon badly wounded and all alone take him in and are soon approached by Mort Harper, who tells them of a great new trail that is perfectly safe. Bannon tells them it them it leads only to Bishop's Valley and not beyond that, but they follow Harper. Bannon knows about this paradise because his hostile half-brother owns the valley. When they come to Bishop's Valley, Harper convinces the members <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> train {{to stay in the}} valley, when Bannon tries to warn them of his half-brother he is forced out of the camp with a gun to his back by Harper and his gang. Harper and his gang try to drag the settlers into a land war, but ultimately Bannon outsmarts them. In the fighting Bannon's brother, the original white settler in the valley, dies redeeming himself for a lifetime of hating his brother. The settlers stay, and Bannon gets the girl.|$|R
5000|$|On October 23, 1864, a <b>wagon</b> train <b>of</b> {{refugees}} {{had come}} from Fort Smith, Arkansas, and was escorted by troops from the 6th Kansas Cavalry {{under the command of}} Col.

They ran into the 1st Indian Brigade led by Maj. Andrew Jackson Piercy near the current Pittsburg Waste Water Treatment Plant. They continued to the north when a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> broke away in an unsuccessful rush to safety. The Confederate troops caught up with them and burned the wagons. The death toll was three Union soldiers and 13 civilian men who had been with the wagon train. It was likely that one of the Confederates had also been killed. A granite marker memorial for the [...] "Cow Creek Skirmish" [...] was placed near the Crawford County Historical Museum on October 30, 2011.|$|R
25|$|Although it was {{the oldest}} design and {{equipped}} with the biggest engine in a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> station <b>wagons</b> that were road tested by Popular Science, the Concord recorded the best acceleration and fuel economy figures (compared to Chevrolet Malibu, Chrysler LeBaron, and Ford Fairmont). The test and driving report summarized that for many customers, the versatile six-cylinder automobiles like the AMC Concord wagon, were excellent substitutes for full-size cars.|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 1960s a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> roughly 100 <b>wagons,</b> pulled {{from both the}} O and ON sub-groups, were fitted with roofs and sprayed {{internally}} with an anti-stick compound, for transport of sand from Koala siding near Lang Lang, to a glass factory in Spotswood.

25|$|In 200, {{during the}} Battle of Guandu between Cao Cao and his rival Yuan Shao, Ren Jun {{was in charge}} of {{logistics}} and transportation of weapons, equipment, supplies, etc., to the frontline. After Yuan Shao's forces attacked Cao Cao's supply trains on a number of occasions, Ren Jun organised the supply trains into <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 1,000 <b>wagons</b> and arranged for them to travel along several different routes heavily protected by camps and pickets. Yuan Shao's forces did not dare to attack Cao Cao's supply trains after that.|$|R

5000|$|In the Fall of 1846, the Donner Party had {{pioneered the}} Hastings Cutoff of the California Trail through what would become, the next year, Salt Lake City. Blazing the new route had slowed the group, who reached the Sierra Nevada {{late in the}} fall. A storm trapped them in the mountains, a {{disastrous}} event. The stories of the Donner Party were still fresh on everyone's mind when a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> arrived at Salt Lake City in early fall, 1849. This {{was too late to}} reach the Sierra Nevada in time to cross the mountains without risk of being similarly trapped, so it appeared the group would have to wait out the winter in Salt Lake City. They heard about the Old Spanish Trail, a route that went around {{the south end of the}} Sierras and was safe to travel in the winter. It was not certain if wagons could take the route, but some had recently headed for the trail to try, so the group found a guide by name of Jefferson Hunt who had previously traveled the route and agreed to lead them. These individuals would become part of a story of human suffering in a place which they named Death Valley.|$|R
