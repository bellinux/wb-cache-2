5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the event on Raw was between WWE Champion John Cena and The Great Khali. This was a rematch of their {{encounter}} at Judgment Day, the pay-per-view two weeks before One Night Stand. At the event, Cena defeated Khali by forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU. When Khali submitted to the STFU, however, <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold. Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali's arm and did not see Khali's feet underneath the bottom rope. The following night on Raw, believing he should not have lost the match, Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match. After Cena's acceptance, Khali Chokeslamed Cena. Heading into One Night Stand, Khali Chokebombed Cena again to win a non-title match against Cena on the June 2 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E

On <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a bottom}} {{slanting}} bar which has several explanations. Claims of evidence indicate {{that there was a}} small wooden platform for the crucified to stand on in order to support his weight; in Jesus' case <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> nailed side by side to this platform with one nail each in order to prolong the torture of the cross.|$|E

25|$|The {{features}} of the earliest attested case, that of a Jewish thief hanged by the feet in Soultzmatt in 1296 are also rather divergent from the rest. The Jew managed, somehow, {{after he had been}} left to die to twitch his body in such a manner that he could hoist himself up on the gallows and free himself. At that time, <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> so damaged that he was unable to escape, and when he was discovered 8 days after he had been hanged, he was strangled to death by the townspeople.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E
500|$|Limbert {{set out on}} {{his third}} and most ambitious foray to the area in May 1920, this time with Walter Cole and an Airedale Terrier to {{accompany}} him. Starting from Minidoka, Idaho, they explored {{what is now the}} monument area from south to north passing Two Point Butte, Echo Crater, Big Craters, North Crater Flow, and out of the lava field through the Yellowstone Park and Lincoln Highway (now known as the Old Arco-Carey Road). Taking the dog along was a mistake, Limbert wrote, [...] "for after three days' travel <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> worn and bleeding".|$|E

500|$|In Mortal Kombat 4, Reptile's {{appearance}} {{became more}} reptilian, {{with his head}} completely uncovered. His hands became clawed, while <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> now three-toed talons. By , Reptile had developed a full reptilian head and tail, with gold and black armor to cover his legs, elbows, shoulders, and belt. Bone spurs extended {{from the base of}} his skull down his spine, ending at the tip of his tail, while a similar spur extended from his heel on each foot. Ed Boon described the changes to Reptile's design {{over the course of the}} two games as hinting at him [...] "evolving into a bigger character", and foreshadowing Onaga controlling his body in [...]|$|E
500|$|Macaulay's bowling {{action was}} relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: [...] "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his {{shoulders}} swaying, but <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely {{knew him as}} passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm {{when there was a}} fighting chance of victory".|$|E
500|$|Fingleton wrote, [...] "He {{crouched}} {{a little}} at the crease...he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball, and <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> so eager {{to be on the}} move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled. This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. I never saw a better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position." [...] However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said [...] "There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal ?" [...] Robinson described Ponsford as the [...] "founder of total batting, the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph." [...] The New South Wales and Australian bowler Arthur Mailey later said that [...] "I don't think it was the rungetting Ponny enjoyed so much as the bowlers' discomfort, especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held {{in the guest room}} of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Revelation {{includes}} John's {{vision of}} the Son of Man: [...] "...and <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> like unto burnt brass, His head and His hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;" [...] , as if they burned in a furnace..." [...] in a vision (...) , but this vision is usually considered to refer to Jesus in heavenly form, not necessarily his appearance during his earthly life.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Niers was {{tortured}} and executed {{over the course}} of three days in September 1581. On the first day, strips of flesh were torn from his body and heated oil was poured into his wounds. [...] On the second day, <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> smeared with heated oil and then held above glowing coal, thereby roasting him. On the third day, 16 September 1581, he was dragged to the place of execution and broken on the wheel; the wheel was slammed down upon him 42 times. Still alive, he was finally dismembered by quartering.|$|E

2500|$|No {{physical}} description of Jesus {{is contained in}} any of the canonical Gospels. [...] In the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is said to have manifested as a [...] "light from heaven" [...] that temporarily blinded the Apostle Paul, but no specific form is given. In the Book of Revelation there is a vision the author had of [...] "someone like a Son of Man" [...] in spirit form: [...] "dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, and his eyes were like blazing fire. <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> like bronze glowing in a furnace (…) His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance." [...] (Revelation 1:12–16, NIV). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form's resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 January 1945, Dennis {{had been}} ordered out to collect sticks. He came home {{shivering}} with {{only a handful of}} sticks and was forced out again by Gough using his stick. He stood in the yard crying and was dragged to the [...] by his hair by Mrs Gough. That night he was thrashed for taking a bite from a swede. The following day he was stripped naked by Gough and thrashed with a stick so hard that it broke; Gough then thrashed him with another stick until his legs were blue and bleeding. The next day he was unable to stand up and when Terence came home from school he found his brother locked in a cubbyhole in the kitchen. <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> by now in a terrible condition and Gough hit him to try to make him stop crying. Dennis complained that his back hurt. Gough beat him with his fists again the following morning; he died in the afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|On July 14, 1882, Ringo's {{body was}} found lying against the low fork of {{the trunk of a}} large tree in West Turkey Creek Valley, near Chiricahua Peak in Arizona Territory. [...] A {{neighboring}} property owner heard a single gunshot on the afternoon of July 13 and discovered Ringo's body the following day. [...] <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt, probably because his horse had gotten loose from its picket and bolted with his boots tied to the saddle—a method commonly used at that time to keep scorpions out of them. [...] There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound {{at the back of his}} head. [...] His revolver had one round expended and was found hanging by one finger in his hand. [...] His horse was found two miles away with his boots still tied to the saddle. A coroner's inquest officially ruled his death a suicide.|$|E

2500|$|Orelli {{signed up}} for active duty {{at the age of}} 21 and joined the Austro-Hungarian front {{at the onset of the}} war in May 1915. Entrenched with the 320 Infantry Regiment, he served as a foot soldier within the Italian Army and engaged in combat {{activity}} in the trenches near Trieste, which was the main battleground in the east. He also participated in combat operations around the Isonzo river. In his autobiography, Orelli went into great detail about his experiences, including the large amount of casualties that he witnessed during his time in the trenches and widespread illiteracy among the peasant soldiers. He referred to them as having [...] "died in silence." [...] He also recalled many violent deaths, such as a friend who bled to death after <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> severed and another who was decapitated in mid-conversation with Orelli. He remarked of episodes such as this that they were [...] "things I do not wish to remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the ensuing}} War of Wrath, Beleriand {{and much of}} the north of Middle-earth was {{destroyed}} and reshaped. Morgoth summoned many Men to his side during the fifty-year conflict, which became the largest, longest, and bloodiest conflict ever fought in Arda's history. In the end, Morgoth was utterly defeated, and his armies were almost entirely slaughtered. The dragons were almost all destroyed, and Thangorodrim was shattered when Eärendil slew the greatest of dragons, Ancalagon the Black, who crashed upon it as he fell. The few remaining dragons were scattered, and the handful of surviving Balrogs hid themselves deep within the earth. Morgoth fled into the deepest pit and begged for pardon, but <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> cut from under him, his crown was made into a collar, and he was chained once again with Angainor. [...] The Valar exiled him permanently from the world, thrusting him through the Door of Night into the void, excluded from Arda until the prophesied Dagor Dagorath, when he would meet his final destruction. His evil remained, however, as [...] "Arda Marred," [...] and his will influenced all living creatures.|$|E
2500|$|Released in July 2008, The Dark Knight broke several {{box office}} records and {{received}} both popular and critical accolades, {{especially with regard}} to Ledger's performance as the Joker. Even film critic David Denby, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] and Ledger as [...] "mesmerising in every scene", concluding: [...] "His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss." [...] Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend Christian Bale, who played opposite him as Batman, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as [...] "the most fun I've ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character." [...] Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it [...] "absolute nonsense" [...] and going on to say, [...] "Heath was so solid. <b>His</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I've ever met." ...|$|E
