Dragendorff (20. 04. 1836 – 26. 03. 1898) was a Professor of Pharmacy at the University of Tartu from 1864 to 1894. The development {{of equipment and}} {{increase in the number}} of chemical and <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> used (3882 different substances) was significant between 1840 and 1885. Currently, there are 5 different collections of <b>herbal</b> and chemical <b>substances</b> in the University of Tartu HistoryMuseum from the Dragendorff period: <b>Herbal</b> <b>substances,</b> Microscopic preparations, Park substances, Wallpaper sample and Textile sample collections. The collection of <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> is the largest (ca 1200). Mostherbal substance exhibits are from the period between 1879 and 1889. However, there are also some exhibits from earlier times (for example 1829 Huanuco, 1846 Hamburg, 1863 Paris and 1867 Venezuela). Professor Dragendorff conducted extensive research to discover the cure for malaria – he was sent Cinchona (Cinchonae cortec) from overseas to be able to prepare a pharmaceutical that helped cure malaria. The microscopic preparations are also from late 19 th century – all together 1197 preparations have been described. The Park substances collection consists of 90 closed glassampoules.

40|$|Background: Herbal {{compounds}} {{are attractive}} anticancer candidates {{due to their}} low toxicity. Pervious {{studies have demonstrated that}} Hibiscus sabdariffa is promising as an anticancer agent against several cancer types; however, its potential therapeutic role in breast cancer remains to be investigated. Materials and Methods: In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa aqueous extract (HSE) on a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF- 7) and fetal foreskin fibroblast (HFFF) were investigated. Different concentrations of water extract of calyces were added and the percentage of cell survival was determined after 24, 48, and 72 hours using an MTT assay. Apoptosis induction was assessed by DNA fragmentation. Results: At the concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml of the extract and following 72 hours of incubation, the number of viable MCF- 7 cells was less than 50 %. The extract was not cytotoxic against normal HFFF cells in all tested concentrations. Also, HSE induced apoptosis only in MCF- 7 cells. Conclusions: These results suggest that HSE inhibits the growth of MCF- 7 cells selectively in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. As this <b>herbal</b> <b>substance</b> {{has been shown to be}} nontoxic at very high doses in experimental animals, it might be a good anticancer drug candidate for breast cancer treatment...|$|E

However, lichens lack cuticolar tissues and are exposed to several atmospheric contaminants, including trace elements. This work aims at exploring the potential toxicity of herbal preparations derived by the lichen Cetraria islandica due to trace element contamination, testing whether different concentrations may be observed, depending on the origin of the raw material. Fourteen samples of C.  islandica, as cut dried thalli occurring on the European market, have been bought from different providers. For each sample, the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V and Zn were measured on comminuted <b>herbal</b> <b>substance</b> and on the corresponding decoction, using atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The elemental concentrations in decoctions were significantly lower than those measured in raw materials, dropping down to levels of negligible health concern.

This study {{was carried out}} to evaluate the antiplatelet effect of total saponin from Korean Red Ginseng (KRG-TS) by investigating whether KRG-TS inhibits thrombin-induced binding of fibrinogen and fibronectin to αIIb/β 3. MethodsWe investigated the effect of KRG-TS on phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and Akt, affecting binding of fibrinogen and fibronectin to αIIb/β 3, and clot retraction. ResultsKRG-TS had an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen and fibronectin to αIIb/β 3 via phosphorylation of VASP (Ser 157), and dephosphorylation of PI 3 K and Akt on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, A-kinase inhibitor Rp- 8 -Br-cyclic adenosine monophosphates (cAMPs) reduced KRG-TS-increased VASP (Ser 157) phosphorylation, and increased KRG-TS-inhibited fibrinogen-, and fibronectin-binding to αIIb/β 3. These findings indicate that KRG-TS interferes with the binding of fibrinogen and fibronectin to αIIb/β 3 via cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP (Ser 157). In addition, KRG-TS decreased the rate of clot retraction, reflecting inhibition of αIIb/β 3 activation. In this study, we clarified ginsenoside Ro (G-Ro) in KRG-TS inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation via both inhibition of [Ca 2 +]i mobilization and increase of cAMP production. ConclusionThese results strongly indicate that KRG-TS is a beneficial <b>herbal</b> <b>substance</b> inhibiting fibrinogen-, and fibronectin-binding to αIIb/β 3, and clot retraction, and may prevent platelet αIIb/β 3 -mediated thrombotic disease. In addition, we demonstrate that G-Ro is a novel compound with antiplatelet characteristics of KRG-TS...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVDs) {{remain to}} be the leading causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} in Hong Kong and worldwide. Among different modifiable risk factors, dietary pattern is on the major determinant for CVD and overall mortality. Other than pharmacological therapies for cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, maintaining a healthy diet is a more sustainable method in general population to prevent CVDs. Current lifestyle intervention in the West countries focus on high intake of fruit and vegetables with more than 400 g per day and limited saturated fats with less than 10 % of energy, there is very limited data on impact of dietary pattern on CVDs in Chinese. Prior studies among Chinese in Hong Kong have shown that only half of the local population fell within these recommended ranges for fat, saturated fatty acid and cholesterol intakes. Several different dietary patterns have been recommended for CVDs prevention based on: i) food groups, such as Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; ii) macronutrients: the low-carbohydrate diet, low glycemic index diet, very-low- fat diet and iii) nutrition or vitamin supplement. However, the effect of different dietary patterns based on modulations of food group, macronutrients and particular micronutrients on vascular structure and function in Chinese subjects is unclear. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the relationships between different dietary pattern and surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular function in different high risk populations for CVDs were investigated. In Chapter 3, we compared the assessment of dietary pattern in Chinese using different tool, including Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); Dietary Record; and Dietitian assessment. In this study, we demonstrated that suitable dietary assessments tools should be chosen for the assessment of different dietary pattern, according to characteristics of assessments. In Chapter 4, the relationship between the fruit intake and subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intimal thickness (IMT) was investigated in patient with type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Our results showed that high fruit intake was associated with lower burden of carotid atherosclerosis, independent of level of vitamin intake in patients with type II DM. In Chapter 5, we compared the impact of high carbohydrate diet on arterial stiffness between control subjects without CVDs and patients with high risk for CVDs. Our findings showed that high carbohydrate diet mainly affected patients with established CVDs, and their increased arterial stiffness was associated with an elevation of blood pressure. In Chapter 6, we determined the effect of dietary vitamin intake on oxidative stress in patients with high risk of CVDs. In those high risk patients for CVDs, we demonstrated that increased dietary intake of vitamin A, beta-carotene and alpha tocopherol were associated with decreased oxidative stress, but these relationships were not observed in those control subjects without CVDs. It is likely attributed to the higher systemic oxidative stress levels in patients with high risk of CVDs. On the other hand, food intake may also affect the clinical efficacy of cardiovascular therapies. In particularly, it has been well established that herbal intake which is commonly used by Chinese can affect the anticoagulant effect of warfarin on patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, in this second part of the thesis, we investigated the effect of concomitant herbal intake on anticoagulation control in patients with non-valvular AF treated with warfarin. Our results showed that patients with AF treated with warfarin had limited knowledge on potential interaction between <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> in foods and warfarin, in which increased <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> intake significantly reduced the percentage time of anticoagulant effect within the therapeutic range. Moreover, a single section of education on knowledge of herbal ingredients did not improve their percentage time of therapeutic range for these patients. In conclusion, these findings suggest that dietary pattern in Chinese might have significant impact of vascular function in patients with type II DM and high risk for CVDs. Moreover, the <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> in the diet among Chinese could have significant impact of the therapeutic effects in some of the cardiovascular medications, such as warfarin. Future clinical studies will be needed to confirm these potential beneficial effects of particular diet intake on vascular function in patients with high risks of CVDs as well as potential interaction between <b>herbal</b> <b>substances</b> in Chinese diet and cardiovascular medications. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
