40|$|The {{process of}} {{research}} for my final paper for History 341 was quite a journey. Originally, I had intended to do in-depth research {{of the life of}} more than one notable woman of the French Revolution, with possibilities ranging from Therese Tallien to Josephine Bonaparte. However, upon my first research day at the library with my classmates, I found there were very few primary sources on these women, with minimal secondary sources. I had read a book about Madame Tussaud previous to taking my class with Dr. Nunez, and was highly intrigued by her life, and the legacy she left behind, including her history tied intimately with the French Revolution. Utilizing the library’s inter-library loan service, I was able to obtain a copy of Tussaud’s memoirs. <b>Getting</b> <b>ahold</b> of those memoirs, however, was quite difficult, as I found out the book is extremely rare, out of print, and few institutions were willing to part with their copies, as they were too fragile to be shipped. I am eternally grateful to Jonathan Overturf for managing to track down a copy for me; without Tussaud’s memoirs this paper could not have been written. I was soon to find, though, that Tussaud’s memoirs were not what I expected them to be. At some points Tussaud was intentionally vague, and there were very little specific dates mentioned throughout her works, making it difficult to piece together a timeline of her life.

40|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Bologna process, higher education in Europe has been undergoing a linguistic transition. English has been adopted as language of instruction (EMI) in several non-English speaking countries (Airey & Linder, 2008 in Sweden; Costa & Coleman, 2012 in Italy; van Splunder, 2010 in Belgium; You & You, 2013 in China, and several others in several other countries). The adoption of such policy poses a transition on teaching and learning practices, consequentially, students and teaching staffs must cope with teaching/studying in English, an L 2 to most of them, while trying to avoid poorer learning (Jensen & Thøgersen, 2011). While watching lectures, students face challenges in terms of comprehending and processing listening-based material: Linguistic, practical, visual, content, cognitive, academic, contextual and knowledge based (de Chazal, 2014). To address the challenges posed by the adoption of EMI, we have found on a previous review of literature study (Kremer & Valcke, 2014), teaching staffs and students have adopted didactical and learning strategies, respectively. The results from that study unveil an overlap in relation to the strategies adopted by students and teaching staffs, indicating their main concerns in the EMI context. The present research is an exploratory empirical study built upon these results. Its objective is to observe and analyze how students cope with listening to lecturers in EMI, via <b>getting</b> <b>ahold</b> of the strategies adopted and analyzing how supportive they are concerning the challenges in listening to lectures in L 2 aforementioned. The context is a bachelor’s degree program (in International Business Management) in a non-English speaking country (Belgium). The research proposes to address two research questions: 	 1 - Which learning strategies have the students adopted to cope with the 	EMI context? 	 2 - How do the learning strategies adopted give support for the students 	while listening to lectures the EMI context? To answer those questions, the methodology selected is composed of: lecture observations, focus groups and questionnaires. The results are organized in the following way: Firstly, we identify the learning strategies adopted by the participants to cope with the EMI context. Secondly, we conduct an analysis of those strategies concerning their adequacy to address the challenges in listening to lecturers in the EMI context mentioned in the theoretical framework...|$|R

As you’ll see, most of the proofs have been omitted in the notes. The {{intention}} is to sketch the proofs during the lectures, but also to have the students work through some of the details (using references such as those listed at the end of this document) as part of the self–study component of module. If you’re having trouble <b>getting</b> <b>ahold</b> of some of the reference texts, I have copies of all of them in my office which you’re welcome to borrow from time to time. I have also included some sample exercises. These are not intended to be terribly difficult, but if you want to discuss the problems with me once the module is over, feel free to do so. 2 Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and Jordan canonical form Suppose that A is a complex matrix of order n. A scalar λ ∈ C is an eigenvalue for A if there is a nonzero vector v ∈ C n such that Av = λv. In that case, the vector v is an eigenvector for A. Occasionally we refer to such a v as a right eigenvector for A. Note that there is a corresponding notion of a left eigenvector as well: a nonzero vector w ∈ C n is a left eigenvector for A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ provided that w ∗ A = λw ∗. The spectral radius of a square matrix A, denoted ρ(A) is given by ρ(A) = {|λ||λ is an eigenvalue of A}. Suppose that the square matrix A has λ as an eigenvalue. A Jordan chain for λ is a finite list of nonzero vectors v 1, [...] ., vk such that Av 1 = λv 1, and for j = 1 2, [...] ., k, Avj = λvj + vj− 1. Evidently v 1 is an eigenvector of A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ. The vectors v 2, [...] ., vk are known as generalised eigenvectors of A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ. The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue λ of A is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial of A, while the geometric multiplicity of λ is the dimension of the null space of A − λI. For any eigenvalue, the algebraic multiplicity is greater than or equal to the geometric multiplicity. Suppose that λ ∈ C and that k ∈ N. The Jordan block Jk(λ) is the k × k upper triangular matri...|$|R
40|$|Syftet med den här studien är att se hur kommunikationen och informationsflödet ser ut mellan familjehem och kommunen samt hur familjehemmen upplever kommunikationen. Anledningen till att vi ville undersöka detta var eftersom vi var intresserade av ämnet, att media har påpekat problem inom familjehem samt att vi inte hittade någon tidigare forskning som undersökte detta. Då vi var intresserade av hur familjehemmen upplever kommunikationen valde vi att utföra studien ur familjehemmens perspektiv. Ett familjehem är en familj som tar emot ett barn som inte kan bo hemma hos sina egna föräldrar på uppdrag av en kommun eller ett företag som arbetar åt kommunen (SKL, 2013 a; Familjehemmet, 2013 a) Teorierna som vi har valt att använda oss utav för att senare analysera resultatet har berör ämnena kommunikation och information. Anledningen till att vi valde dessa teorier var därför att de passar vårt syfte samt att missförstånd och konflikter kan bero på bristande kommunikation eller brister i informationsflödet. För att utföra den här studien så har vi använt oss av en kvalitativ ansats där vi har intervjuat tre olika familjehem, ett ansikte-mot-ansikte och två via telefon. Intervjuerna har haft en halvöppen struktur med en intervjuguide (se bilaga 1) med mestadels öppna frågor. Då informationen som kommer fram kan vara känslig så har vi valt att behandla informanterna med anonymitet. Resultatet visar på brister i både kommunikationen och informationsflödet och att familjehemmen är missnöjda med det. En av anledningarna till att det finns brister är att kommunikationskanalerna inte fungerar optimalt då familjehemmen har svårt att få tag på socialsekreterarna. I analysen kopplas teorierna ihop med resultatet, där vi kan se orsaker och anledningar till att familjehemmen upplever kommunikationen och informationsflödet på ett visst sätt samt vilka påföljder som kan uppstå av eventuella brister som till exempel varför kommunikationskanalerna inte fungerar optimalt och vad detta kan leda till. Sedan för vi en diskussion kring resultatet, kommer med förslag till förbättring samt diskuterar studiens validitet och reliabilitet. Vårt förslag till förbättring vore att ha ett informationssystem där familjehemmen och kommunen kan delge varandra {{relevant}} information som ett komplement till den muntliga kommunikationen. Avslutningsvis så kontrollerar vi om vi har besvarat syftet samt ger förslag till fortsatt forskning såsom att se på ämnet ur kommunernas perspektiv. The {{aim of this}} study is to see how the communication and information flow looks between foster home and the municipality and how foster homes experience the communication. The reason we wanted to investigate this was because we were interested in the subject, that the media had pointed out problems with foster families and we did not find any previous research that had examined this. Since we were interested in how foster homes experienced the communication, we chose to perform the study form the perspectives of the foster homes. A foster family is a family that receives a child who cannot live at home with their parents on behalf of a municipality or a company who works for the municipality (SKL, 2013 a; Familjehemmet, 2013 a). The theories that we have chosen to use to later analyze the results touches the topics communication and information. The reason we chose these theories was because they suited our purpose, and that misunderstandings and conflicts can be due to a lack of communication or lack of information flow. To perform this study, we used a qualitative approach in which we have interviewed three different foster families, one face-to-face and two by telephone. The interviews had a semi-open structure with an interview guide (see Appendix 1) with mostly open-ended questions. As the information that emerges may be sensitive, we have chosen to treat informants with anonymity. The results show deficiencies in both the communication and information flows and the foster homes are dissatisfied with it. One of the reasons that there are flaws is that the communication channels are not functioning optimally due to that the foster homes have a hard time <b>getting</b> <b>ahold</b> of their social workers. In the analysis the theories are connected together with the result, where we can see the causes and reasons for why foster homes experience communication and information flow in a certain way, and the penalties that may arise from any flaws such as why communication channels are not functioning optimally and what this can lead to. Later we discuss the results, make suggestions for improvement and discuss the study's validity and reliability. Our suggestion for improvement would be to have an information system where foster homes and the municipality can communicate {{relevant information}} to supplement oral communication. Finally we check to see if we have answered our purpose, and we give suggestions for further research such as to look at the subject from perspective of the municipality...|$|R

Utifrån ett folkhälsoperspektiv är vikten av en djupare kunskap kring detta fenomen väsentlig bland unga kvinnor och män och tidigare studier kring detta bland unga män är få. Syfte: Syftet med studien var att studera unga mäns erfarenheter och uppfattningar om sin hälsa och kroppsideal som framställs på sociala medier. Metod: Studiens genomfördes med en induktiv ansats med semistrukturerade intervjuer som datainsamlingsmetod. Urvalet bestod av sex personer i åldrarna 18 – 25 år som tränade minst två gånger i veckan. En tematisk analys användes vid analys av materialet. Resultat: Analysen resulterade i ett huvudtema: Sociala media, hälsa och kroppsideal, en växelverkan. Detta huvudtema resulterade i fyra underteman: Hälsa som resurs, ohälsa som hinder, kroppsideal och vägar dit, samt media som påverkansfaktor. I dessa underteman hittades koder som samtliga har en {{relation}} till huvudtemat. Slutsats: Hälsa är ett omfattande begrepp som innefattar fler faktorer som bidrar till en hälsosam livsstil. Massmedias framställning av hälsa uppfattas av denna grupp som en fixering av de kroppsliga idealen kontra den subjektiva hälsan. För dessa deltagare är upplevelsen av vilseledande hälsoinformation lättillgänglig medan den korrekta hälsoinformationen uppfattas som svårare att nå. Abstract   Background: The {{easy access}} to social media and a focus on male and female body ideals that are presented in social media can lead to depression, anxiety and physical inactivity. From a public health perspective, {{the importance of a}} deeper knowledge of this phenomenon is essential for young women and men, and past studies of this subject among young men are few Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to study young men’s experiences and perceptions of their own health and body ideals in relation to health and body ideals presented on social media. Method: The study was conducted with an inductive approach with semi-structed interviews as data collection method. The sample consisted of six people between the ages of 18 - 25 who exercised at least twice a week. The material was analyzed using a thematic analysis. Results: The analysis of the results led to a main theme: Social media, health and body ideals – an interaction. The main theme consists of four sub-themes: Health as a resource, ill health as an obstacle, body ideals and ways to reach them, and media as an impact factor. In these sub-themes, codes were found, each of which relate to the main theme. Conclusion: Health is a comprehensive concept that includes many factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle. The mass media’s production of health images is perceived by interviewed in this study as a fixation of the body ideals versus subjective health. For these participants, the experience of misleading health information is readily available while the correct health information is perceived as more difficult to <b>get</b> <b>ahold</b> of. ...|$|E

The Bologna process aims at enhancing attractiveness and competitiveness of higher education institutions in Europe (Prague Communiqué, 2011). To achieve this objective, one of the aspects to be improved is promotion of mobility (for students and staff). Language is a natural obstacle for mobility, in Europe and around the globe. English has been adopted as language of instruction (EMI) in several non-English speaking countries as means of facilitating mobility (Airey & Linder, 2008 in Sweden; Costa & Coleman, 2012 in Italy; van Splunder, 2010 in Belgium; You & You, 2013 in China, and several others in several other countries). Although English as a second language (ESL) is well spread in Europe and worldwide, three main hypothesis suggest bilingual disadvantages in relation to language processing and memory, they are: The cross-linguistic interference hypothesis, which assumes that second language (L 2) processing is more difficult because of competition with representations in the first language (L 1) (Weber & Cutler, 2004). The weaker-links hypothesis, which understands that accessing linguistic representations in L 2 is slower and less accurate than in L 1, since the L 2 is less frequently used, it has weaker representations (Gollan et al., 2008). And lastly, the resources hypothesis, which assumes that L 2 processing taxes working memory capacity more intensively than L 1 processing would, consequently, it leaves less time for other capacity-demanding activities. (Gollan et al., 2008) The adoption of such policy poses a transition on teaching and learning practices, consequentially, students and teaching staffs must cope with teaching/studying in English, a second language (L 2) to most of them, while trying to avoid poorer learning (Jensen & Thøgersen, 2011). While watching lectures, students face critical challenges concerning listening in L 2 in terms of comprehending and processing listening-based material. The main challenges in listening are: Linguistic, practical, visual, content, cognitive, academic, contextual and knowledge based (de Chazal, 2014). To address the challenges posed by the adoption of EMI, we have found on a previous review of literature study (Kremer & Valcke, 2014) that teaching staffs and students have put into practice didactical or learning strategies, respectively, {{both inside and outside the}} classroom. The results from that study unveil an overlap in relation to the strategies adopted by students and teaching staffs, indicating the main concerns of the key actors in the EMI context. The present research builds upon the previous review of literature study formerly mentioned. It deviates from the previous since it is an exploratory empirical study and it prioritizes listening to lecturers. Its objective is to observe and, subsequently, analyze how students cope with listening to lecturers in EMI, via getting ahold of the strategies adopted and analyzing how supportive they are concerning the challenges in listening to lectures in L 2 aforementioned. The present research has as context a bachelor’s degree program (in International Business Management) in a non-English speaking country (Belgium). The research proposes to address two research questions: 1 - Which learning strategies have the students adopted to cope with the EMI context? 2 - How do the learning strategies adopted give support for the students while listening to lectures the EMI context? To answer those questions, the methodology selected is composed of: lectures observations (so that the researcher is acquainted with the listening-based material presented to the students/participants), focus groups (to <b>get</b> <b>ahold</b> of the strategies used by the students/participants) and notes analysis (to enrich and complement the data gathered from the focus groups). The results will be organized in the following way: Firstly, we will identify the learning strategies adopted by the participants to cope with the EMI context (from the focus groups and notes taken during lectures). Secondly, we will conduct an analysis of those strategies concerning their adequacy to address the challenges in accessing and processing listening-based material (lecturers) in the EMI context mentioned in the theoretical framework...|$|E
