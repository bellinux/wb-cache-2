5000|$|A {{piston engine}} has {{a part of}} the {{combustion}} chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located. A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the tip seals. Clearly, if a spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel's combustion chamber it would foul the rotating tip; and if the plug were recessed to avoid this, the sunken spark might lead to poor combustion. So a new type of [...] "surface discharge" [...] plug was developed for the Wankel. Such a plug presents an almost flat face to the combustion chamber. A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly; and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode. The advantage is that the plug sits just beneath the tip-seal that sweeps over it, keeping the spark accessible to the fuel/air mixture. The [...] "plug gap" [...] remains constant throughout its life; and the spark path will continually vary (instead of darting from the centre to the side electrode as in a conventional plug). Whereas a conventional side electrode will (admittedly, rarely) come adrift in use and potentially cause engine damage, this is impossible with a surface <b>discharge</b> <b>plug,</b> as there is nothing to break off. Surface-discharge spark plugs have been produced by inter alia, Denso, NGK, Champion and Bosch.|$|E

40|$|Elimination or {{reduction}} of auxiliary oxygen use in Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs) is necessary if {{the technology is}} to compete with existing Ramjet systems. This thesis investigated a Transient Plasma Ignition (TPI) system {{and found that the}} technology can at least reduce and may be able to completely remove the auxiliary oxygen requirement of current PDE systems. TPI was tested and compared with a traditional capacitive <b>discharge</b> spark <b>plug</b> system in a dynamic flow, ethylene/air mixture combustor. Ignition delay time, Deflagration-to-Detonation transition (DDT) distance and time, detonation wave speed and fire success rate performance were analyzed for various mass flow rates and stoichiometric ratios. A transient plasma dualelectrode concept was also employed and analyzed. Results show that TPI is more effective and reliable than the spark plug ignition with considerable improvements to DDT performance. The TPI dual-electrode concept was proven to be the most effective configuration with average reductions in DDT distance and time of 17 % and 41 % respectively when compared to the capacitive <b>discharge</b> spark <b>plug</b> system configuration...|$|R
40|$|Three {{concepts}} for optimizing the performance, {{increasing the}} fuel economy, and reducing exhaust emission of the piston aircraft engine were investigated. High energy-multiple spark <b>discharge</b> and spark <b>plug</b> tip penetration, ultrasonic fuel vaporization, and {{variable valve timing}} were evaluated individually. Ultrasonic fuel vaporization did not demonstrate sufficient improvement in distribution to offset the performance loss caused by the additional manifold restriction. High energy ignition and revised spark plug tip location provided no change in performance or emissions. Variable valve timing provided some performance benefit; however, even greater performance improvement was obtained through induction system tuning which could be accomplished with far less complexity...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a one-millipound pulsed plasma ignition system study. The preliminary data indicate that inductively coupling the ignition plug cathode to the thruster cathode is more beneficial to ignitor plug longevity than resistive coupling. These benefits arise from {{the ability of the}} coupling conductor to control the build-up of a carbonaceous deposit on the plug face. The deposit build-up is a strong function of the peak coupling current experienced during thruster operation. The relationship between the ignitor <b>plug</b> <b>discharge</b> and thruster discharge is shown to be very complex with equivalent circuit elements which are dynamic in nature. A preliminary representation of this equivalent circuit is developed...|$|R
5000|$|Normally during human pregnancy, the mucus is cloudy, clear, thick, and sticky. Toward {{the end of}} the pregnancy, {{when the}} cervix thins, some blood is {{released}} into the cervix which causes the mucus to become bloody. As the woman gets closer to labor, the mucus <b>plug</b> <b>discharges</b> as the cervix begins to dilate. The plug may come out as a plug, a lump, or simply as increased vaginal discharge over several days. The mucus may be tinged with brown, pink, or red blood, which is why the event is sometimes referred to as [...] "bloody show". Loss of the mucus plug by no means implies that delivery or labor is imminent.|$|R

The breadboard model PPT {{presented in this paper}} will be a part of six PPTs propulsion system designed to provide attitude and translational control for a 20 -kg nanosatellite for a total delta-V of 40 m/s. The thruster performances have been characterized in terms of electrical parameters, mass bit, impulse bit, and specific impulse. The thruster was found to be compliant with the mission requirement. Moreover, preliminary electromagnetic noise interference measurements have been performed.

However, some complications associated with the mesh plug have been reported recently. We hereby present a case of an 80 -year-old female admitted to our hospital with swelling and pain in the right lower abdomen 5  years after hernia repair with the PerFix <b>plug.</b> <b>Discharge</b> of urine through the route of exploratory needle puncture demonstrated the fistula of skin and the bladder. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal US, and cystoscope examination revealed that the mesh plug had penetrated into the bladder. As far as we know, this is the first report that a mesh plug has migrated into the bladder.|$|R

The other form of NLCS clinically manifests as a solitary dome-shaped or sessile papule. The classical NLCS is mostly reported to involve the pelvic or gluteal region. We report here a case of adult-onset classical NLCS on perianal area because of its rarity and unusual location.

40|$|A microwave-assisted {{spark plug}} {{was used to}} extend the lean {{operating}} limit (lean limit) and reduce emissions of an engine burning methane-air. In-cylinder pressure data were collected at normalized air-fuel ratios of λ= 1. 46, λ= 1. 51, λ= 1. 57, λ= 1. 68, and λ= 1. 75. For each λ, microwave energy (power supplied to the magnetron per engine cycle) was varied from 0 [*]mJ (spark discharge alone) to 1600 [*]mJ. At lean conditions, the results showed adding microwave energy to a standard spark <b>plug</b> <b>discharge</b> {{increased the number of}} complete combustion cycles, improving engine stability as compared to spark-only operation. Addition of microwave energy also increased the indicated thermal efficiency by 4 % at λ= 1. 68. At λ= 1. 75, the spark discharge alone was unable to consistently ignite the air-fuel mixture, resulting in frequent misfires. Although microwave energy produced more consistent ignition than spark discharge alone at λ= 1. 75, 59 % of the cycles only partially burned. Overall, the microwave-assisted spark plug increased engine performance under lean operating conditions (λ= 1. 68) but did not affect operation at conditions closer to stoichiometric...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this cooperative research is to develop and verify models of internal combustion engine spark ignition devices {{in order to improve}} combustion chamber fuel ignition characteristics and to improve spark plug durability. As a direct result of this joint research, a novel spark plug design was improved. A theory of spark arc motion was developed that explains experimentally observed effects not explained by other published theories. The knowledge developed by this research will be used to further improve spark plugs as well as improve the ignition process in a combustion chamber. The predictive models developed here are compared with experimental measurements, including high-speed photographs, of the spark as it translates across the gap. Two different spark plug configurations were investigated: the conventional or J-gap plug, and a novel spark ignition device (the FANG plug) invented by Cummins, Inc., the CRADA partner. A description of the physics of arc dynamic motion in a spark plug gap, including the effects of an imposed transverse magnetic field, appears here in Appendix A {{as a result of the}} analytical effort. The theory proposed here does explain experimentally observed effects not completely explained by other research publications appearing in the scientific literature. These effects are due to pressure and ion, electron, and electrode interactions. A dominant mechanism for electrode erosion is presented for both spark plug configurations. Reversing the polarity of both types of spark plugs has verified this proposed erosion mechanism, according to data collected at Cummins. An extensive series of experiments measured the arc position, voltage, and current as a function of time during the approximately 2 millisecond spark <b>discharge.</b> FANG <b>plug</b> data, obtained with the fast-framing camera experimental apparatus operating at 200, 000 frames per second, are presented that show the transverse arc velocity varying directly as the inverse square root of the elapsed time since arc initiation. At the request of Cummins, experiments were performed on three conventional spark plugs identical in design and having the same spark gap, but differing as follows: one was new, another had been used in an engine, and the third was new but had been sandblasted to simulate a used plug. Cummins had observed that only the used plug required a significantly higher breakdown voltage. Experiments at ORNL indicated that the used plug had a significantly higher breakdown voltage confirming the Cummins observations (although the sandblasted plug also exhibited a higher breakdown voltage than the new plug but lower than the used plug), and thus an apparent increase of the arc breakdown voltage results as the plug ages in use. Further analysis of this phenomenon is warranted...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the absence}} of thermal agitation, {{granular}} materials are often found in a metastable state {{in the sense that}} a partial flow of grains may occur in response to a small perturbation. The flow is transient in nature and stops as the grains get jammed in a new metastable state. The prediction of the onset and propagation of such transient granular flows and their arrest is crucial to practical issues such as risk assessment with respect to landslides and granular avalanches in geotechnics, silo <b>discharge</b> and <b>plug</b> flow in pipelines. The fragile nature of metastable states leads to a fluctuating behavior with marked spatial correlations and broad distributions of the number of mobilized grains, flow lifetimes or resulting macroscopic deformations. In this talk, I discuss the stochastic nature of these dynamic events and their spatial correlations in two different systems by mean of extensive contact dynamics simulations. The first system is a silo in the jamming regime, i. e. a silo with an opening sufficiently small that the flow stops in finite time. The temporal behavior will be analyzed with the outlet size R as control parameter. Our numerical data are consistent with a stationary Poisson process: 1) for the sequence of passing grains with the flow rate Q(R) as parameter, and 2) for the sequence of jamming events with the mean number ⟨N⟩(R) of passing grains between consecutive jams as parameter. This feature reveals {{the absence of}} memory in the process as a consequence of chaotic dynamics in the fluidized zone above the outlet. We show that the function ⟨N⟩(R) is dictated by the Beverloo law at small R and by a diverging mean flow lifetime ⟨T ⟩ as a critical opening is approached. The second system that will be considered in this talk is a granular bed subjected to gradual rotation. The principal stress directions rotate with respect to the free surface until a surface avalanche is initiated. However, as long as the slope angle is below the avalanche angle, the granular layer undergoes a gradual plastification as a result of local instabilities and rearrangement events. I will focus for this system on the spatial correlations. We introduce an order parameter defined as the density of critical contacts, i. e., contacts where the friction is fully mobilized. The spatial correlation of critical contacts reveals the occurrence of ʻʻfluidizedʼʼ clusters which exhibit a power-law divergence in size at the approach of the avalanche limit. At the same time, an increasingly large number of grains are overloaded {{in the sense that they}} are found to carry a stress ratio above the Coulomb yield threshold of the whole packing. Using this property, a coarse-graining length scale is introduced at which all stress ratios are below the packing yield threshold. This length increases with the slope angle and jumps to a length comparable to the depth of the granular bed at an angle below the avalanche angle. This transition coincides with the onset of dilation in the packing. We map this transition into a percolation transition of the overloaded grains...|$|R
40|$|The IsaMill is a {{recently}} developed process equipment, first commissioned {{on a large}} scale in the early 90 s in an effort to help recover values from old mine dumps due to improvements in downstream extraction technologies which could further recover values from ores with fine particles, a technology which was not available before. Also due to depletion of easy-to-extract ores and prevalence of fine grained ores which cannot be economically liberated using the traditional mills like ball mills, there was need to develop a mill that could grind ore to sizes of the order of less than 20 micrometres; hence the evolution of the Isamill. As this is a recent technology, limited research has been done to fully characterise this mill, important to mineral processing economics as it is Milling efficiency and operation of the plant can be improved if the degree of mixing in the mill can be reduced as that reduces overgrinding or under grinding. A clearer understanding of the mill dynamics will help in coming up with better understanding of mill operations which will assist in developing better mill design and control philosophies. An M 4 pilot IsaMill with overall length 393 mm and internal diameter 135 mm was used for the test work. Temperature measurements were used to identify the mixing process in the mill. Ten resistance temperature devices (RTDs) were inserted {{along the length of the}} mill from feed to discharge. Holes were drilled on the mill shell and insulated copper conductors were glued into the holes. The copper conductors had drilled holes into which the RTDs were inserted to pick the heat transferred by the copper from the mill. A 16 -channel data logger was used to convert the measured temperatures into an analogue temperature signal that was displayed on a personal computer. The following process parameters were varied during the test runs to observe their effect on the resulting temperature profile along the length of the mill from feed to discharge: (i) Slurry flow rate (2 - 3 l/min). (ii) Mill tip speed (1 500 rpm- 2 000 rpm). (iii) Media load (1. 5 - 2. 5 l). A platinum ore, UG 2, from Amandebult in South Africa was used for the test work at Anglo American Technical Solutions. A feed with F 80 = 88 μm was used for the tests. The characteristic temperature profile from the feed point to the mill <b>discharge</b> indicated overall <b>plug</b> flow behaviour with some axial mixing superimposed on the plug flow behaviour. The recirculating media and coarse particles at feed point caused a step change in temperature of the slurry as it enters the mill. The greatest temperature change within the mill was observed to occur at the first compartment of the mill. A predictive model was developed (through use of mass and energy balances) to correlate the mill variables, tip speed, feed flow rate and media load with the resulting mill temperatures. The mixing coefficients of the mill were calculated. The model can predict the degree of mixing in the mill and could be used to predict the temperature profile along the length of the mill as well, given any combination of the above three mill variables. It has been shown that use of temperature data acquisition systems has potential to improve control and monitoring of the IsaMill both operationally and from a maintenance point of view as the condition of the mill can be monitored without actually having to stop the mill but by looking at variations from the signature temperature profile...|$|R
