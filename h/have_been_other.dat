5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E

5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, and there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent {{has suggested that the}} term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|Historical eclipses {{are a very}} {{valuable}} resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The Collegian {{has been}} the school student {{newspaper}} of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> similar publications, such as The Oriole, the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however The Collegian is oldest, continuous student-run publication. Originally, the newspaper was both managed and printed by students. During the 1930s, The Collegian won numerous awards including {{second place in the}} Columbia Scholastic Press Association's annual contest for five years in a row. Since 2000, printing of the publication has been scaled back. The Collegian is now published quarterly, often with a bonus issue {{around the time of the}} annual City-Poly football game. Since 2014, The Collegian also actively engages students and alumni through various social media platforms.|$|E

Dick (Ryan Hansen) has just returned, getting into Hearst, but he is shaken up from Beaver’s suicide. Vinnie (Ken Marino) approaches Keith (Enrico Colantoni) with a case, but he denies it. Keith is tracking a bail-jumper. Stosh “Piz” Piznarski becomes Wallace’s (Percy Daggs III) roommate, and Piz loses all his belongings. Veronica comes in to help. Keith’s bail-jumper, Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe) and he gets into the car with Keith. Veronica and Mac listen to a rape victim protesting the university’s policies on the issue.

Veronica and Piz visit the police department, and they say there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> victims. Veronica learns that the Hearst “Welcome Wagon” is actually fake.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>other</b> cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
