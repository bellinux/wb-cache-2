40|$|Abstract—Efficient <b>dc</b> <b>fault</b> {{simulation}} of nonlinear analog circuits is {{addressed in this}} paper. Two techniques, one-step relaxation and adaptive simulation continuation, are proposed. By one-step relaxation, only one Newton–Raphson iteration is performed for each faulty circuit with the dc solution of the good circuit as the initial point, and the approximate solution is used for detecting the fault. The paper shows experimentally and justifies theoretically that approximate <b>dc</b> <b>fault</b> simulation by one-step relaxation can accomplish almost the same fault coverage as exact <b>dc</b> <b>fault</b> simulation. Exact <b>dc</b> <b>fault</b> simulation by adaptive simulation continuation is first to order faulty circuits {{based on the results}} of one-step relaxation, and then to use the solution of the previous faulty circuit as the initial point for the Newton–Raphson iteration of the next faulty circuit. Experiments on a set of 29 MCNC Circuit Simulation and Modeling Workshop bench-mark circuits show that exact <b>dc</b> <b>fault</b> simulation by adaptive simulation continuation can achieve an average speedup of 4. 4 and as high as 15 over traditional stand-alone fault simulation.

40|$|Abstract — For a large multi-terminal HVDC system, it is {{important}} that a <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> on a single branch does not cause significant disturbance to the operation of the healthy parts of the DC network. Some DC circuit breakers (DCCBs), e. g. mechanical type, have low cost and power loss, but have been considered unsuitable for <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> protection and isolation in a multi-terminal HVDC system due to their long opening time. This paper proposes the use of additional DC passive components and novel converter control combined with mechanical DCCBs to ensure that the healthy DC network can continue to operate without disruption during a <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> on one DC branch. Two circuit structures, using an additional DC reactor, and a reactor and capacitor combination, connected to the DC-link node in a radial HVDC system are proposed to ensure over-current risk at the converters connected to the healthy network is minimized before the isolation of the faulty branch by mechanical DCCBs. Active control of <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> current by dynamically regulating the DC components of the converter arm voltages is proposed to further reduce the fault arm current.

40|$|In a multi-terminal HVDC system, DC circuit {{breakers}} (DCCBs) are conventionally connected in a star-configuration to enable isolation of a <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> from the healthy system parts. However, a star-connection of DCCBs has disadvantages {{in terms of}} loss, capacity, reliability, etc. By rearranging the star-connection DCCBs, a novel delta-configuration of DCCBs is proposed in this paper. As each terminal is connected {{to each of the}} other terminals through only one DCCB, the current flows through only one DCCB when transferring power between any two terminals compared with two DCCBs in the current path for the conventional star-arrangement. The total loss of the proposed delta-configuration is only 33. 3 % of that of star-configuration, yielding a high efficiency. Also, any <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> current is shared between two DCCBs instead of one DCCB in the faulty branch suffering the fault current. As a result, DCCB capacities in the proposed delta-configuration are only half those in a star-arrangement. Additionally, in the case of one or two DCCBs out of order, the power can still be transferred among three or two terminals, thereby affording high supply security of all HVDC links. Based on the DCCB delta-configuration, two novel <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> protection structures with external and internal DC inductances are proposed. Their characteristics are discussed and it is shown a <b>DC</b> <b>fault</b> can be isolated using slow DCCBs without exposing any converter to significant over-current.
