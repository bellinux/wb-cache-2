5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 west of NY383 was {{originally}} maintained by Monroe County. This section was concurrent {{with three different}} county route designations, one <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> different road names along this stretch. The portion of NY252 on Ballantyne Road was designated by Monroe County as County Route125 (CR125) while the Beaver Road segment was CR127 and the Archer Road piece was CR129. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of NY252 west of NY383 was transferred from Monroe County {{to the state of}} New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June20. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007. The entirety of NY252 is now maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E

5|$|The first bomb {{assembly}} {{team was}} formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not in Washington, for a much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special weapons unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special weapons units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special weapons unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear weapons with its new North American AJ Savage bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special Weapons Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special weapons unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special Weapons Group, with all seven special weapons units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special Weapons Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear weapons, {{and by the end}} of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> Midway-class carriers.|$|E
