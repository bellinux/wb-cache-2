50|$|Internally, the {{facelift}} {{consists of}} {{an extension of the}} driver <b>guard</b> <b>panel</b> to include the on-bus vault (passengers now must put their hand through a gap in the panel to reach the vault) and a slightly modified staircase separation wall, which now features a glass panel, presumably to improve the view of passengers sitting in the seat {{directly in front of the}} wall.|$|E
50|$|Front-rear weight {{distribution}} is {{claimed to be}} 50/50% when both seats are occupied. Layout is front mid-engined and rear-wheel drive. The hood, roof, roll bar and lower front <b>guard</b> <b>panels</b> are aluminium.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{protection}} system (TPS), designed for incorporation with space shuttle orbiter systems, consists of one primary heat shield thermally and structurally {{isolated from the}} test fixture by eight peripheral <b>guard</b> <b>panels,</b> all encompassing an area of approximately 12 sq ft. TPS components include tee-stiffened Cb 752 /R- 512 E heat shields, bi-metallic support posts, panel retainers, and high temperature insulation blankets. The vehicle primary structure was simulated by a titanium skin, frames, and stiffeners. Test procedures, manufacturing processes, and methods of analysis are fully documented.

50|$|Werhand made {{numerous}} {{artifacts from}} copper, brass, bronze, aluminum, and steel. In addition to fulfilling contracts {{for the public}} sector, he created sculptures using the technique of repoussé, and other works of art including: fire <b>guards,</b> door <b>panels,</b> numerous metal images and engravings, (inspired by artworks by Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt), coats of arms, lights, reliefs, and copper portraits, as well as hand-forged window grilles, railings, candle holders, lamps and various other pieces of art.|$|R
5000|$|The SIG Sauer P238 is {{a compact}} [...]380 ACP caliber, single-action pistol {{announced}} by SIG Sauer at the 2009 SHOT Show. It is modelled after the classic M1911, {{similar to the}} Colt Mustang pistol, with a classic SIG Sauer scalloped slide and finger relief under the trigger <b>guard.</b> Grip <b>panels</b> are fluted polymer making this an all-metal frame firearm in competition with plastic-framed pistols {{in the same class}} like the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec P-3AT.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{slightly}} larger {{version of the}} SIG Sauer P238 (.380 ACP) pistol. Trigger pull is listed at 7.5 to 8.5 lb. A finger relief exists under the trigger <b>guard.</b> Grip <b>panels</b> are one of three kinds of wood, Hogue G-10 Extreme composite, or rubber wrap around in the [...] "Sport" [...] model. The frame is metal, unlike many other subcompact 9 mm handguns. The frame for all P938 models is anodized aluminum alloy, and the slide is stainless steel either bare or with SIG's Nitron coating.|$|R
50|$|For 1948, the Series 62 {{was moved}} to the same 126 in chassis as the Series 61, making the {{vehicles}} virtually identical. The main difference, apart from extra chrome, was the availability of a convertible model. Distinguishing features included grooved bright metal front fender gravel <b>guards,</b> rocker <b>panel</b> brightwork, chevron style chrome slashes below taillights and slightly richer interior trim. Also in 1948 the first tail fins were added. Sales fell to 34,213, nevertheless accounting for a record 68% of all Cadillacs sold. Its appearance is similar to cross-town rival Chrysler Imperial and the Chrysler New Yorker initially in 1949, and less so with yearly appearance changes.|$|R
5000|$|Modern snow {{guards are}} made of {{polycarbonate}} and/or metals, depending on the type, size, and specific function of the guard. Although primarily installed for functional purposes, <b>panel</b> <b>guards</b> and snow railing are sometimes used to highlight a roof's aesthetic appeal and design. Some manufacturers have designed metal powder-coated color armor shields to match the colors of varying roof types, and snow rails are commonly colored to complement the roofs they protect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{is presented in}} a two-dimensional cross-section on screen, showing the locations of <b>guards,</b> doors, switch <b>panels,</b> lights, security cameras, and other features, including the target objectives. The player, as Conway, can run and climb on walls, use stairwells and elevators, and using the abilities of Conway's [...] "Bullfrog" [...] hypertrousers, can launch the character great heights or distances, potentially tackling guards or breaking through glass walls. Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player {{to stay out of}} the guards' line of sight.|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{model was}} applied to the passenger door unit of a fleet of 38 Class 380 trains operating on Scotland’s railway network. The data required for the analysis were collected from the literature, the company’s maintenance management software system called EQUINOX, the UK’s railway performance management software DATASYS BUGLE and the UK’s train movements monitoring system called TRUST. The five why’s technique was used to identify the potential failure modes of door unit components and their root causes, including the defects in relation to pushbuttons, door control unit (DCU), mechanical failures, light barrier, door drive, <b>guard</b> operating <b>panel</b> (GOP), limit switches, loose plugs, obstructions, door roller and lubrication. The results of the risk evaluation showed that the nine failure modes (12  % {{of the total number of}} failure modes identified) are “high critical” to door system functionality. The results of this study were used not only for assessing the performance of current maintenance practices, but also to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance (PM) programme for different components of rolling stock. To avoid the recurrence of the failure modes, a new mileage-based preventive maintenance (PM) programme including 14 tasks was proposed.|$|R
2500|$|The dancing warriors {{scene is}} known from six {{fragments}} and occurs four {{times on the}} helmet. It is seen on the two panels immediately above the eyebrows, accounting for five of the fragments. The sixth fragment {{is placed in the}} middle row of the dexter cheek <b>guard,</b> on the <b>panel</b> closest to the face mask; the generally symmetrical nature of the helmet thus implies the design's position on the opposite side as well. None of the six pieces show both warriors, although the [...] "key fragment" [...] depicts their crossed wrists. A full reconstruction of the scene was inferred after the first reconstruction, when Rupert Bruce-Mitford spent six weeks in Sweden and was shown a nearly identical design on the then unpublished Valsgärde 7 helmet.|$|R

50|$|Another 53 {{cars were}} ordered from the Union Construction Co. in 1929, {{to enable the}} {{remaining}} 1920 Stock cars, which had air doors but were not really suitable for operation on the open sections of the Piccadilly line, {{to be transferred to}} the Bakerloo line. An extra train of two motor cars and four trailers was ordered in 1930, to test several new features. They were the last cars to be built by the Union Construction Co., for it was closed as a result of political pressure in 1932. The new motor cars were 1 ft longer, and the trailers were 2 ft longer. This was achieved by tapering one or both ends, to prevent them fouling the structure gauge on curves. On two of the trailers, the centre door openings were widened from 4 ft to 5 ft. On the other two, the width of the centre doors was not altered, but the seating capacity was reduced from 48 to 40, to allow the provision of an additional single-leaf door {{at both ends of the}} car. The position of the <b>guard's</b> door control <b>panel</b> was altered, although this was not found to be satisfactory, and was dropped from subsequent builds.|$|R
