5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Canada in 1883, {{incoming}} governor <b>general</b> <b>the</b> Marquess of Lansdowne resided at Rideau Cottage while waiting for Rideau Hall to be vacated by the outgoing Governor <b>General,</b> <b>the</b> Marquess of Lorne. Other residents included Lionel and Lilias Massey during Vincent Massey's time as governor general; Georges Vanier, as Aide-de-camp to Governor <b>General</b> <b>the</b> Viscount Byng of Vimy, and Barbara Uteck, private secretary to the governor general from 2000 to 2006, and her husband, Graham Fraser. Uteck's successor, Stephen Wallace, resided in Rideau Cottage until the weekend of 24–25 October 2015, when he vacated the premises to allow then prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau and his family {{to live in the}} house while the traditional official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, 24 Sussex Drive, was undergoing assessment for repairs and restoration.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in <b>general.</b> <b>The</b> most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E

5|$|Blamey was {{appointed}} Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces on 27 March.

Charles Carnan served as governor of Maryland between 181619. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant <b>general</b> <b>the</b> same day. During his tenure, he was predominantly concerned with planning for possible {{deployment of the}} ARRC in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was eventually deployed to Afghanistan, but not until after Dannatt had handed over its command to David Richards. Dannatt was knighted with his investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in June 2004. He succeeded Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as Commander-in-Chief, Land Command (CINCLAND)—responsible for day-to-day running of the Army—on 7 March 2005, and was promoted to full <b>general</b> <b>the</b> same day. The prevailing issue during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief was the reorganisation of the infantry, an emotive issue as it resulted {{in the loss of}} many historic regimental names, including Dannatt's regiment, the Green Howards, which became 2nd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards). However, his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect the commitments of the British Armed Forces at the time.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Generals were {{officers}} ranking immediately {{below the}} Marshals of France.

5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in <b>general.</b> <b>The</b> great white shark, however, is rarely {{an object of}} {{commercial}} fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.|$|E
5|$|Following an eruption, it is {{very common}} {{for the public to}} hold fears about {{chemical}} contamination of water supplies. However, in <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash. Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system.|$|E

In 1912, his health began to fail. He died on January 8, 1914, after a week-long bout with uremic poisoning. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Green Hill Zone {{is remembered}} as a classic within both the Sonic the Hedgehog series and video games in <b>general.</b> <b>The</b> level and its music have also {{received}} positive opinions from critics.

5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E
